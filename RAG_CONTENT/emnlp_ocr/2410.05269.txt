Abstract
Data is a crucial element in large language
model (LLM) alignment. Recent studies have
explored using LLMs for efficient data col-
lection. However, LLM-generated data often
suffers from quality issues, with underrepre-
sented or absent aspects and low-quality data-
points. To address these problems, we propose
DATA ADVISOR , an enhanced LLM-based
method for generating data that takes into ac-
count the characteristics of the desired dataset.
Starting from a set of pre-defined principles in
hand, DATA ADVISOR monitors the status of
the generated data, identifies weaknesses in the
current dataset, and advises the next iteration of
data generation accordingly. DATA ADVISOR
can be easily integrated into existing data gen-
eration methods to enhance data quality and
coverage. Experiments on safety alignment
of three representative LLMs ( i.e., Mistral,
Llama2, and Falcon) demonstrate the effective-
ness of DATA ADVISOR in enhancing model
safety against various fine-grained safety issues
without sacrificing model utility. Warning: this
paper contains example data that may be offen-
sive or harmful.
1 Introduction
Data serves as a crucial element in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs), as data quality and
coverage profoundly impact the utility and safety
of LLMs (Wang et al., 2023a; Ouyang et al., 2022;
Köpf et al., 2023; Yin et al., 2023; Conover et al.,
2023). Since human annotation is costly and does
not scale easily, recent studies have utilized LLMs
to produce new datasets (Wang et al., 2023b; Yuan
et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2023b; Honovich et al., 2023;
Xu et al., 2023a; Mehrabi et al., 2023), with the
main human involvement being the provision of a
small set of seed data as in-context examples.
Although LLM-generated data can readily scale,
it often suffers from known quality issues (Chen
et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Pre-vious methods typically generate new data via in-
context learning (Wang et al., 2023b; Yuan et al.,
2024), without considering dataset-level proper-
ties ( e.g., coverage and diversity). Without addi-
tional guidance, the data generator is unaware of
the overall dataset statistics, which can lead to the
omission of specific aspects and the amplification
of its own biases over iterations (Das et al., 2024;
Chung et al., 2023; Felkner et al., 2024). Thus,
the generated data can fail to align LLMs with di-
verse goals, such as addressing fine-grained safety
issues (Bhardwaj et al., 2024; Inan et al., 2023; Ji
et al., 2023). Moreover, some issues can manifest
as low-quality datapoints, such as ambiguous or
redundant questions. Although filtering out and
refining low-quality data is possible (Chen et al.,
2023; Liu et al., 2023; Parkar et al., 2024; Bai et al.,
2022b), the postprocessing pipelines lead to a no-
table reduction in preserved data. For instance,
Alpagasus (Chen et al., 2023) noted that 83% of
Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) data should be discarded
due to its detrimental impact on LLM alignment.
These observations underscore the significance of
proactively generating expected data, a direction
that remains under-explored in existing literature.
In this paper, we propose DATA ADVISOR ,
which enhances LLM-based data generation by dy-
namically andproactively incorporating guiding
principles of the target dataset (for safety align-
ment).1DATA ADVISOR instructs the data genera-
tor to create alignment data with predefined princi-
ples, involving both quality and directional control
of an independent prompt, as well as the overall
statistics of the dataset. With a set of principles
in hand, DATA ADVISOR monitors the status of
the generated data, identifies weaknesses in the
current dataset, and advises the next iteration of
1While we use safety alignment as the primary testbed,
DATA ADVISOR can be applied to dynamic data curation in
broader scenarios, such as instruction tuning, preference opti-
mization, and domain adaptation.arXiv:2410.05269v1  [cs.CL]  7 Oct 2024Figure 1: Overview of DATA ADVISOR for dynamically enhancing standard LLM-based data generation (bottom).

data generation accordingly. At the monitor stage,
it summarizes the current dataset iteratively, with
the last data summary and the newly generated in-
stance as input. At the advise stage, it identifies
the current data weaknesses based on the summary,
which is sent to the data generator later to guide the
generation of the next instance. DATA ADVISOR
can be easily integrated into existing data gener-
ation methods, such as Self-Instruct (Wang et al.,
2023b; Yuan et al., 2024), to enhance data quality
and coverage.
To verify the effectiveness of DATA ADVISOR ,
we conduct experiments on the safety alignment
of LLMs. One of the primary challenges in safety
alignment is ensuring comprehensive coverage of
diverse safety issues (Bhardwaj et al., 2024; Inan
et al., 2023). To address this, DATA ADVISOR pri-
oritizes the coverage of safety issues, guiding the
data generator to produce data that targets miss-
ing or underrepresented safety concerns in each
iteration. We generated 10K safety alignment dat-
apoints using DATA ADVISOR , encompassing a
wide range of fine-grained safety issues. By in-
tegrating the generated data with additional instruc-
tion tuning datasets, such as Alpagasus, we create
a balanced training set. We then train three base
LLMs ( i.e., Mistral, Llama2, and Falcon) using this
mixture of safety alignment and instruction tuning
data. The aligned models demonstrate improvedsafety across diverse issues without compromising
overall model utility compared with the predomi-
nant data generation methods like Self-Instruct.
Our contributions are three fold. First, we pro-
pose DATA ADVISOR , an LLM-based data gen-
eration method that dynamically andproactively
incorporates the guiding principles of the tar-
get dataset. Equipped with dataset-level guide-
lines, DATA ADVISOR achieves improved data
quality and coverage, thereby enhancing LLM
alignment. Second, we demonstrate the effective-
ness of DATA ADVISOR in improving safety align-
ment without compromising overall model utility.
Third, we release the generated safety alignment
dataset, which covers a wide range of fine-grained
safety issues, to support future research.
2 Preliminaries
LLMs have demonstrated advanced capabilities in
instruction following (Zhang et al., 2023) and in-
context learning (Brown et al., 2020). Building
upon these capabilities, recent studies have applied
LLMs to generate data automatically for further
training themselves or other LLMs, reducing the
need for extensive human annotation (Wang et al.,
2023b; Yuan et al., 2024). As shown in the bottom
of Fig. 1, the typical data generation process begins
with a set of seed data serving as the exemplar
pool. This process is performed iteratively. In eachiteration, the data generator ( i.e., an LLM) samples
multiple exemplars from the pool. These exemplars
are then filled into a prompt template and sent to the
data generator to produce new data via in-context
learning. The newly generated data is subsequently
added back to the exemplar pool, marking the end
of one iteration. The final dataset is used to train
the target LLM, enhancing its capabilities.
Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2023b) is one of the
prominent LLM-based data generation methods.
It uses the target LLM itself as the data genera-
tor, generating paired prompts and responses in
each iteration. In the context of safety alignment,
prompts for training should cover diverse safety
issues, while responses require careful safety con-
sideration. Thus, following Yuan et al. (2024), we
generate prompts and responses separately to meet
their distinct requirements. Specifically, we use an
independent safety-aligned LLM to provide safe
responses to the generated prompts. As another
general setting in this paper, we assume that the
target LLM is unknown in order to demonstrate the
generalizability of the generated data. Therefore,
we use an independent LLM as the data generator
and validate the effectiveness of the generated data
on different target LLMs. For simplicity, we retain
the name “Self-Instruct” for the baseline through-
out the rest of the paper.
In the typical data generation process described
above, while the LLMs used as data generators play
a crucial role in the quality of individual prompts
and responses, they have limited control over the
overall data generation process. The properties
of the generated data are primarily determined by
the initial seed data and the prompts used for data
generation. Without additional guidance, the data
generator is unaware of the overall dataset statistics,
can overlook important data properties, and may
produce unsatisfactory generated data.
3 D ATA ADVISOR
DATA ADVISOR (Fig. 1) seeks to enhance LLM-
based data generation methods by dynamically
guiding the process with principles aligned to the
desired dataset. With an LLM acting as the advisor,
the advice for data generation is achieved through
a series of automatic communications between the
advisor and the existing data. With a set of guid-
ing principles, DATA ADVISOR monitors the status
of the generated data, identifies weaknesses in the
current dataset, and advises the next iteration ofdata generation accordingly. These principles for
data generation specify the purpose of the dataset,
key properties to focus on, and additional require-
ments throughout the generation process. These
principles are in the same spirit as collecting human
supervision based on a set of guidelines to govern
AI behavior, akin to the concept of Constitutional
AI (Bai et al., 2022b). They can vary depending
on the application scenarios. We leave further dis-
cussion of data generation principles in different
scenarios to applied researchers and legal experts.
In the following paragraphs, we use diversity and
coverage of safety issues as example principles to
introduce the details of the method.
Data Summarization. Initially, given the existing
data, DATA ADVISOR generates a concise report
about the data properties, including the distribution
of data across various perspectives. This step is
formulated as query-focused summarization. The
principles (such as topics and domains to cover)
for guiding the generation of expected data are
converted into a meta-summary and provided to
DATA ADVISOR as a prompt. The detailed prompt
template for this step is shown in Appx. §A. The
advisor then completes the report based on the ex-
isting data. However, as the dataset size could
continuously expand, it becomes impractical to
provide all data to the advisor as a holistic prompt
every time. Therefore, we adopt an iterative ap-
proach to updating the summary. In each iteration,
the advisor receives the newly generated data point
along with the previous summary as input. At the
outset, we query the advisor to summarize the seed
data from scratch without any previous summary
available. This iterative process allows for a more
efficient and scalable monitoring of the dataset’s
properties and evolution. The typical prompt tem-
plate for this step is shown as follows, with a de-
tailed version in Appx. §A.

{New Instance}
{New Summary}
This step is visualized as the top right part of
Fig. 1. In safety alignment, DATA ADVISOR initial-
izes the data summary with the fine-grained safety
issues contained in the seed data. For example, the
seed data covers self-harm, violence, and illegal
activities. Then, when a new data point is gen-erated and added to the dataset, DATA ADVISOR
updates this summary by adding the safety issue
(e.g., privacy violation) of the new data point.
Data Weakness Identification. Next,
DATA ADVISOR identifies data weaknesses
according to the data summary and the predefined
principles. Each iteration, the data advisor is
prompted to discern a specific weakness. We pro-
vide the data summary along with data generation
principles as a prompt to the data advisor. The
detailed prompt template for this step is shown
in Appx. §A. By translating the summary into
actionable insights, the DATA ADVISOR enables
the data generator to focus on addressing specific
weaknesses afterwards, thereby facilitating the
iterative improvement of the generated data. The
typical prompt template for this step is shown as
follows, with a detailed version in Appx. §A.
Weakness Idenfication Prompt Template
{Guiding Principles}
{Data Summary}
{New Weaknesses}
This step is visualized as the top middle part
of Fig. 1. For safety alignment, the data genera-
tion principles instruct the data advisor to prioritize
the diversity and coverage of safety issues. This
ensures that the generated dataset encompasses a
broad spectrum of safety concerns, thereby enhanc-
ing the model’s ability to address various safety-
related challenges effectively. Given the data sum-
mary from the last step, DATA ADVISOR may iden-
tify that cyberbullying is underrepresented in the
existing data.
Data Generation with Advice. Finally,
DATA ADVISOR generates the new data point tar-
geting the identified weakness. This step is formu-
lated as controlled generation. The weakness is
converted into a prompt, which is then forwarded
to the data generator, providing guidance for the
generation of the next data point. In this way, stan-
dard data generation is combined with control sig-
nals, guiding the generator to focus on specific as-
pects to fulfill specific goals. As a result, the newly
generated data can enhance the overall quality of
the dataset. This iterative process ensures that the
dataset remains diverse, relevant, and aligned with
the desired objectives. The typical prompt template
for this step is shown as follows, with a detailed
version in Appx. §A.Data Generation Prompt Template

{Data Weakness}
{New Instance}
This step is visualized as the top left part of
Fig. 1. Given that the absence of cyberbullying-
related data is the weakness of existing data,
DATA ADVISOR generates a new data point about
“spreading rumors about someone online” to enrich
the dataset from this perspective.
4 Experiment
In this section, we first introduce the experimental
setup (§4.1), with a particular focus on the eval-
uation of safety and utility. This is followed by
the presentation of the main results on three rep-
resentative LLMs (§4.2). Finally, we provide de-
tailed analyses of fine-grained model performance,
data diversity, data mixture, and qualitative results
(§4.3).
4.1 Experimental Setup
Evaluation Protocol. We evaluate the quality of
the LLM-generated data by assessing how well
LLMs perform after finetuned on the data. Fol-
lowing previous works (Ge et al., 2023; Touvron
et al., 2023), we finetune base LLMs with a mixture
of safety alignment data and additional instruction-
tuning data to balance the model’s safety and utility.
Then, we evaluate the model’s safety by prompt-
ing the finetuned LLMs with harmful questions
and evaluate the harmful rate of their responses.
We also evaluate the model’s utility on a multitask
language understanding benchmark.
Evaluation Datasets. For safety evaluation, we
use two harmful question datasets with detailed
harmful categories designed for evaluating fine-
grained LLM safety. CatQA (Bhardwaj et al.,
2024) consists of 550 harmful questions evenly
distributed on 11 categories, where each category
have five sub-categories. Fig. 3 presents all the
categories, such as economic harm and malware
viruses. BeaverTails (Ji et al., 2023) has 700 harm-
ful questions covering 14 harm categories, such as
adult content and child abuse. Fig. 4 presents all the
categories. For utility evaluation, we use MMLU
(Hendrycks et al., 2020), a multitask language un-
derstanding benchmark that is widely used to eval-
uate the utility of LLMs. Specifically, we use the
validation set consisting of 1,530 multiple-choiceFigure 2: Safety and utility of models trained with different data with Mistral (left), Llama2 (middle), and Falcon
(right) as base models. Models trained with D ATA ADVISOR achieves better safety without hurting utility.
questions, ranging from elementary mathematics
to extensive world knowledge.
Evaluation Metrics. Following Zhou et al. (2024),
we use LlamaGuard (Inan et al., 2023) as an auto-
matic evaluation metric. LlamaGuard can classify
each prompt-response pair into safe or unsafe. We
report the ratio of safe responses as safety score
and the ratio of unsafe responses as harmful rate on
each dataeset. For MMLU, we report the average
accuracy as the utility score.
Base Models. We conduct experiments on three
representative LLMs. Mistral -v0.1 (Jiang et al.,
2023) is a pretrained language model released un-
der the Apache 2.0 license. Llama2 (Touvron et al.,
2023) is pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of public
data. Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023) is trained on
1,500B tokens of RefinedWeb (Penedo et al., 2023)
and is released under the Apache 2.0 license. For
all the three models, we use the base version of 7
billion parameters without instruction tuning and
safety alignment.
Baseline. We compare DATA ADVISOR with the
widely used LLM-based data generation method,
Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2023b). Starting from a
small set of seed data, it generates new data with
in-context learning. After each iteration of data
generation, the candidate pool of in-context ex-
amples is updated and enlarged. Self-Instruct is
originally proposed to generate instructions, inputs,
and outputs at the same time. We follow Yuan et al.
(2024) to generate 10K prompts independently for
safety alignment.
Implementation Details. For both Self-Instruct
andDATA ADVISOR , we use Mistral-7B-Instruct-
v0.2 as the data generator. We use a safety-aligned
LLM ( i.e., Llama2-Chat-7B) to pair each prompt
with a safe response. For DATA ADVISOR , we ran-
domly sample three in-context examples for 10
times in each iteration and generate 10 prompts

dle), and Falcon-based models (bottom).
in one batch for efficiency. For Self-Instruct, we
randomly sample five in-context examples each
time. During training, we combine the generated
safety alignment data with 9K instruction tuning
data from Alpagasus, resulting in a roughly bal-
anced training set for aligning to helpfulness and
harmlessness objectives. For all models, we adopt
LoRA tuning (Hu et al., 2021) with rank set to 32
andαset to 16. We use a batch size of 32 and a
learning rate of 0.00002. During inference, we use
vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) to improve throughput
for efficiency. The decoding temperature is set to 0
and the max number of tokens to generate is set to
128.
4.2 Main Results

three models before and after training with LLM-Figure 4: Harmful rate by category on BeaverTails for Mistral-based models (top), Llama2-based models (middle),
and Falcon-based models (bottom).
generated safety alignment data. Both Self-Instruct
and DATA ADVISOR improve model safety on
CatQA and BeaverTails across different base mod-
els. On CatQA, all base models initially achieve
safety scores ranging from 26.4 to 47.3, while
Self-Instruct and DATA ADVISOR result in av-
erage improvements of 41.5 and 51.6, respec-
tively. On BeaverTails, all base models initially
achieve safety scores between 50.7 and 57.0, with
Self-Instruct and DATA ADVISOR yielding aver-
age improvements of 26.7 and 31.3, respectively.
DATA ADVISOR consistently outperforms Self-
Instruct in terms of both safety and utility across
all base models. On average, DATA ADVISOR
achieves a +10.1 increase in safety scores on
CatQA, a +4.6 increase on BeaverTails, and a +1.6
increase in utility scores on MMLU compared to
Self-Instruct. These results indicate the effective-
ness of DATA ADVISOR in generating safety align-
ment data. They also demonstrate that the data
generated by DATA ADVISOR is effective across
different base LLMs.
4.3 Analysis
We provide detailed analyses from four perspec-
tives: results on fine-grained safety issues, data
diversity, the effect of data mixture, and qualitative
results of data generated by D ATA ADVISOR .
DATA ADVISOR improves model performanceon all harmful categories. We further ana-
lyze the fine-grained results by harmful cate-
gory. Fig. 3 shows the results by category
on CatQA. DATA ADVISOR achieves better or
comparable harmful rates across all categories,
with the rates for Adult Content, Child Abuse,
Hate/Harass/Violence, and Tailored Financial Ad-
vice dropping to zero, whereas Self-Instruct may
generate harmful responses across all categories.
The category where DATA ADVISOR outperforms
Self-Instruct the most is Economic Harm, with a
performance gap of 24%. This is followed by Adult
Content, Child Abuse, and Illegal Activity, each
with a performance gap of 20%. Fig. 4 shows the
results on BeaverTails. Similarly, DATA ADVISOR
achieves lower harmful rates across all categories
compared to Self-Instruct. The largest perfor-
mance gap appears in the categories of organized
crime and terrorism, where DATA ADVISOR re-
duces harmful rates by an additional 28%. Follow-
ing this, DATA ADVISOR outperforms Self-Instruct
in aiding and abetting, incitement, and violence by
22%.
DATA ADVISOR can improve data diversity. To
evaluate data diversity, we measure the ratio of dis-
tinct n-grams (Li et al., 2016) in prompts from
both LLM-generated safety alignment data and
human-annotated evaluation data. As shown in
Fig. 5, the evaluation data, which is carefully cu-Figure 5: Ratio of distinct n-grams for all prompts
in LLM-generated safety alignment data and human-
annotated evaluation data. The x-axis represents differ-
ent values of n.
rated by humans and includes diverse categories
of safety issues, exhibits higher ratios of distinct
n-grams. This finding indicates a correlation be-
tween the ratio of distinct n-grams and the quality
and diversity of safety alignment data. For LLM-
generated data, DATA ADVISOR achieves much
higher ratios of distinct n-grams across different
ncompared to Self-Instruct. The gap between the
two methods grows larger, reaching up to 50% as
nincreases. Notably, the distinct 8-gram ratio
ofDATA ADVISOR surpasses that of the human-
curated CatQA, reaching 91.8%. In contrast, Self-
Instruct never exceeds 42%.
Mixture of safety alignment and instruction
tuning data is necessary. Fig. 6 shows the per-
formance of Mistral-based models trained with
different alignment data. The results suggest
that both the safety alignment data generated by
DATA ADVISOR and the instruction tuning data
from Alpagasus are essential for balanced per-
formance. Without training data targeting safety,
model performance on CatQA and BeaverTails
drops by 51.5% and 23.0%, respectively. Con-
versely, without training data targeting utility, al-
though model safety can exceed 99%, utility drops
by 16.9%, which is worse than the base model
before training. Combining both types of data bal-
ances the safety and utility of the aligned model,
resulting in a model that is both safer and more
helpful. Notably, the model’s utility after training
with the mixture of data is better than when trained
with Alpagasus data alone.
Correctness of Intermediate Outputs. We further
analyze the quality of summarization and weakness
identification in each iteration. The summaries and
weaknesses are presented in a structured format.
We extract the updated part in each iteration and
Figure 6: Ablation on training data. Both safety align-
ment data and utility alignment data are essential.
check their quality. For summaries, we assess if
the newly added weaknesses are not included or
if partial content from the last summary is miss-
ing. Overall, 84% of the summaries are updated
accurately. For weaknesses, we assess if they in-
troduce new safety issues not identified in prior
iterations by comparing key words. Overall, 75%
of the weaknesses introduce new safety issues. No-
tably, this ratio does not change significantly as
the iterations increase. In the first 500 iterations,
the summary accuracy is 85% and the weakness
accuracy is 77%. In the last 500 iterations, the
summary accuracy is 83% and the weakness ac-
curacy is 71%. We argue that the data advisor is
noise-tolerant . Even if no weakness is identified in
an iteration, the data advisor can still benefit from
the more diverse exemplar pool accumulated in
prior iterations and generate more diverse data than
Self-Instruct. As we use a highly structured sum-
mary and weakness format which only requires
minimal updates each iteration, future work can
improve the stability of summarization with rule
checks and correct the errors based on the feedback
of the checker.
Qualitative Results. We present examples
of prompts with safety concerns generated by
DATA ADVISOR in Tab. 1. These prompts are dis-
tributed throughout the generation iterations, cov-
ering diverse categories of safety issues. We ob-
serve that DATA ADVISOR can identify underrep-
resented or missing safety issues in the existing
data and suggest new directions for the next iter-
ation of data generation. The capabilities of iden-
tifying weaknesses and advising new directions
do not degrade with iterations. Even around itera-
tion 1,000, DATA ADVISOR continues to propose
new safety issues ( e.g., Moral Dilemma Inducing),
thereby increasing data diversity. Some of the gen-
erated safety issues are rarely explored in previous
datasets, such as challenges to personal beliefs,
threats to linguistic diversity, and moral dilemmas.Iteration Safety Issue Prompt

5 Related Work
In this section, we briefly review two relevant re-
search directions.
5.1 LLM-based Data Curation
The landscape of data curation with LLMs has
seen significant advancements recently. In terms
of instruction tuning data generation, Wang et al.
(2023b) introduce Self-Instruct, where LLMs gen-
erate instruction-following data. Yuan et al. (2024)
follow the Self-Instruct method to iteratively gen-
erate data and updating the LLM. Other works,
such as Taori et al. (2023), explore using a strong
LLM like GPT-4 to generate complex instructions.
Instruction Backtranslation (Li et al., 2023) aug-
ments and curates training data by backtranslating
between instructions and responses. Prior work
has also explored generating preference data with
LLMs (Lee et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024). In ad-dition to data generation, another line of work in-
vestigates data cleaning with LLMs. Chen et al.
(2023) use advanced LLMs to assess the quality of
generated data. Bai et al. (2022b) prompt LLMs to
refine the generated data. These works collectively
contribute to the enhancement of data curation ca-
pabilities in LLMs. However, the proactive gener-
ation of datasets with targeted properties remains
underexplored, which is the focus of our paper.
5.2 Safety Alignment
The increasing prominence of LLMs has under-
scored the critical importance of enhancing their
safety and reliability (Touvron et al., 2023; Inan
et al., 2023). Various techniques have been pro-
posed to address safety concerns, notably during
the phases of supervised fine-tuning, instruction
tuning, and preference alignment (Bai et al., 2022a;
Ge et al., 2023). Among these techniques, a com-monly employed approach involves LLMs with
safety alignment data, which aims to ensure that the
models adhere to ethical guidelines and avoid gen-
erating harmful content (Ouyang et al., 2022). De-
spite these efforts, recent studies have highlighted
persistent issues of misalignment, where LLMs
may unintentionally produce unsafe or biased out-
puts, thereby compromising their reliability and
trustworthiness (Bhardwaj et al., 2024; Ji et al.,
2023). This underscores the need for safety align-
ment data of higher quality with better coverage
and diversity to address real-world issues, ensuring
that LLMs can effectively align with human values
and societal norms.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose DATA ADVISOR , an
LLM-based data generation method dynamically
and proactivelyguiding the process with princi-
ples aligned to the target dataset. With a set
of predefined principles in hand, DATA ADVISOR
monitors the status of the generated data, iden-
tifies weaknesses in the current dataset, and ad-
vises the next iteration of data generation accord-
ingly. Experiments on safety alignment of three
representative LLMs demonstrate the effective-
ness of DATA ADVISOR in enhancing model safety
against various fine-grained safety issues without
sacrificing model utility. Further analyses show
that DATA ADVISOR exhibits better data diver-
sity than Self-Instruct, and its ability to identify
dataset weaknesses does not degrade with itera-
tions of data generation. Future work can extend
DATA ADVISOR to other scenarios, such as mit-
igating backdoor in instruction tuning data (Xu
et al., 2024), preventing data bias in preference
optimization (Wang et al., 2024b), and integrating
constraints for task adaptation (Wang et al., 2024a).

Limitation
While we have conducted comprehensive experi-
ments on safety alignment to demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of DATA ADVISOR , there are still sev-
eral limitations. First, applying DATA ADVISOR
to generate other types of data, such as instruc-
tion tuning data, remains unexplored. Future workcould investigate the potential of DATA ADVISOR
in these areas to further validate its versatility and
efficacy. Second, the scale of our experiments is
limited to 7B models and a dataset size of 10K.
Larger-scale experiments involving bigger mod-
els and more extensive datasets could provide ad-
ditional insights into the robustness and scalabil-
ity of DATA ADVISOR . Third, there are multiple
choices for some components in DATA ADVISOR ,
but we have only experimented with a subset of
these options. Exploring a wider range of configu-
rations and parameters could uncover more optimal
settings and enhance the overall performance of
DATA ADVISOR . Addressing these limitations in
future research will help to solidify the practical
applications of DATA ADVISOR and ensure its ef-
fectiveness across a broader spectrum of use cases.
Ethical Consideration
We recognize that LLMs, if not properly trained,
can inadvertently produce responses that are bi-
ased, offensive, or otherwise harmful. Our ex-
periments focus on mitigating unethical responses
from LLMs. To achieve this goal, our method
generates prompts that cover a wide range of real-
world scenarios that may have ethical concerns.
While one could respond with harmful informa-
tion, our dataset contains only harmless responses.
The dataset is intended to be used to enhance the
harmlessness of LLMs.
