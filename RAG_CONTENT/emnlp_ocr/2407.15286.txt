Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of
producing content that perpetuates stereotypes,
discrimination, and toxicity. The recently pro-
posed moral self-correction is a computation-
ally efficient method for reducing harmful con-
tent in the responses of LLMs. However, the
process of how injecting self-correction instruc-
tions can modify the behavior of LLMs remains
under-explored. In this paper, we explore the ef-
fectiveness of moral self-correction by answer-
ing three research questions: (1) In what scenar-
ios does moral self-correction work? (2) What
are the internal mechanisms of LLMs, e.g., hid-
den states, that are influenced by moral self-
correction instructions? (3) Is intrinsic moral
self-correction actually superficial in terms of
reduced immorality in hidden states ?
We argue that self-correction can help LLMs
find a shortcut to more morally correct output,
rather than truly reducing the immorality stored
in hidden states. Through empirical investi-
gation with tasks of language generation and
multi-choice question answering, we conclude:
(i) LLMs exhibit good performance across both
tasks, and self-correction instructions are par-
ticularly beneficial when the correct answer is
already top-ranked; (ii) The morality levels in
intermediate hidden states are strong indicators
as to whether one instruction would be more
effective than another; (iii) Based on our analy-
sis of intermediate hidden states and task case
studies of self-correction behaviors, we are first
to propose the hypothesis that intrinsic moral
self-correction is in fact superficial.
1 Introduction
The safe use of LLMs has become a promi-
nent research topic, focusing on preventing LLMs
from generating harmful outputs. Safety align-
ment (Rafailov et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022; Meng
et al., 2024) has emerged as a default approach
for aligning LLMs with human values. However,alignment methods have been reported to lack ro-
bustness (Zhou et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023; Lee
et al., 2024), and even aligned models remain vul-
nerable to Jailbreak attacks (Wei et al., 2024).
Moral self-correction (Ganguli et al., 2023; Kr-
ishna, 2023; Kim et al., 2024), along with self-
correction for other applications (Madaan et al.,
2023), involves the use of instructions to guide
LLMs in modifying their responses towards spe-
cific objectives, e.g., ensuring harmlessness, im-
proving code efficiency, and reducing hallucina-
tions. Intrinsic self-correction fundamentally relies
on the LLMsâ€™ inherent capability to critique and
refine their outputs, without the need for external
resources or effort to provide reasonable feedback.
An example of this is the instruction: Please en-
sure that your answer is unbiased and does not
rely on stereotypes (Ganguli et al., 2023). From
an application standpoint, intrinsic self-correction
is more efficient, computationally and empirically,
than other methods necessitating feedback from hu-
mans, tools, or much more powerful LLMs (Huang
et al., 2023). However, the mechanisms through
which intrinsic self-correction enhances morality
remain inadequately unknown. To elucidate this
underlying mechanism, this paper explores the un-
derlying processes of moral self-correction1in the
specific contexts of gender bias, stereotypes, and
toxicity. We aim to answer three key research ques-
tions:
RQ1: In what scenarios does moral self-
correction work? We explore both multi-choice
QA tasks (Rudinger et al., 2018; Parrish et al.,
2022) and language generation tasks (Gehman
et al., 2020). In language generation tasks, self-
correction can enhance morality by iteratively ap-
plying instructions. But, in multi-choice QA tasks,
optimal performance is often achieved in the first
1In this paper, we use moral self-correction and intrinsic
moral self-correction interchangeably.
1arXiv:2407.15286v3  [cs.CL]  7 Oct 2024round, with no further improvement in subsequent
self-correction steps. This task-wise performance
discrepancy is attributed to the varying difficulty
levels of the tasks, and that self-correction has been
shown to be beneficial when the correct answer is
already top-ranked.
RQ2: What are the internal mechanisms that are
associated with moral self-correction instructions?
We investigate how self-correction instructions can
influence the behavior of LLMs through the lens of
their internal hidden states. Based on probing ex-
periments, we find that self-correction instructions,
when combined with a transition layer, reduce the
immorality level in hidden states. However, the
difference between hidden states with and with-
out self-correction instructions is slight, advocating
our proposed hypothesis for superficial intrinsic
moral self-correction (see RQ3 below). By exam-
ining attention heads and feed-forward layers, we
find that self-correction enhances morality in atten-
tion heads across all tasks but increases immorality
in feed-forward layers for multi-choice QA tasks.
Through a simulation task of binary classification,
our empirical findings show that internal hidden
states can strongly characterize the effectiveness
of these instructions. Thus, we outline a prototype
to craft 10 biased statements for the estimation of
morality levels of the hidden states, which are then
used to gauge the effectiveness of self-correction
instructions. Specifically, this correlation allows
us to leverage the moral features of hidden states
to predict the effectiveness of one instruction ver-
sus another, eliminating the need for trial-and-error
instruction improvement. Our proposed prototype
method is also extensible, providing a backbone for
the development of more sophisticated methods.
RQ3: Is intrinsic moral self-correction actu-
ally superficial? Based on our empirical evidence
from RQ2, as well as additional case studies of re-
sponses in language generation tasks, we propose
the hypothesis that intrinsic moral self-correction
cannot effectively recognize or remove immorality
from responses. However, it can superficially make
moral decisions by leveraging a shortcut guided
by self-correction instructions. This shortcut is re-
flected by the fact that self-correction instructions
do not significantly reduce the retrieved immoral
knowledge in hidden states or feed-forward layers,
but only intervene the attention heads (Sec 4.3).
These research questions address our core task:
how and why intrinsic moral self-correction works.
Through a detailed analysis of morality levels em-bedded in intermediate hidden states, our study
provides empirical evidence for when moral self-
correction can work, develops an efficient proto-
type for optimizing self-correction instructions, and
is first to propose a significant hypothesis: that in-
trinsic moral self-correction is superficial.
2 Related Works
Self-correction can drive LLMs to enhance their
output by incorporating actionable and specific
instructions tailored for typical objectives (Pan
et al., 2023). These instructions may take the
form of norms (Ganguli et al., 2023) that LLMs
should adhere to, or evaluations of generated con-
tent (Chen et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023; Gao
et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a). In terms of moral
self-correction, Zhao et al. (2021) initially demon-
strated that undesired bias in output of RoBERTa-
large (Liu et al., 2019) could not be corrected by
injecting natural language interventions, conclud-
ing that small-scale LLMs lack the capability for
moral self-correction. Building on this, Schick et al.
(2021) explored larger models and found that T5-
XL (Raffel et al., 2020) and GPT2-XL (Radford
et al., 2019) are capable of self-diagnosing and self-
debiasing. While they did not specifically focus
on self-correction, their findings suggest that di-
agnosing and mitigating bias in a self-motivated
manner is feasible for LLMs with over one billion
parameters. Further empirical evidence from Gan-
guli et al. (2023) highlights how the capacity for
moral self-correction is influenced by both the num-
ber of training steps and model scales, concluding
that this capacity emerges in LLMs with at least
22B parameters. However, the analysis of internal
mechanisms remains an open research question.
Regarding the internal mechanisms of LLMs,
the difference between feed-forward layers (FFLs)
and the attention heads has been the main research
line for interpreting LLMs. Geva et al. (2021) first
proposed that FFLs are actually key-value memo-
ries. Based on this, subsequent works try to edit the
stored knowledge with circuit analysis rather than
fine-tuning (Meng et al., 2022b), or use circuit-
based methods with the induction head (Olsson
et al., 2022). Another research line is to explore
the logit lens (Belrose et al., 2023) of intermediate
hidden states, projecting those hidden states into
the vocabulary space and examining the next to-
ken associated with the hidden representation. Lee
et al. (2024) leverage the logit lens to analyze how
2safety alignment can help LLMs avoid toxic out-
puts, and Yu et al. (2023) utilize the logit lens to
understand how FFLs and attention heads interact
to store factual knowledge.
In this paper, we decipher moral self-correction
based on the linear probing vector. Linear prob-
ing vector is firstly proposed by Alain and Bengio
(2016) for interpreting the hidden states in black-
box neural networks, and the probing vector is ac-
quired from a linear classifier. For instance, we can
train a toxicity classifier and take the weight dimen-
sion associated with the toxicity label, then we can
use this weight vector to measure how much a given
hidden state vector is close to the probing vector
(weight vector) with a cosine similarity. Since the
probing vector is from a classifier, it only contains
information relevant to the classification objective.
The probing vector has been an effective tool for
network interpretability research, and it has been
widely used in understanding the safety behavior
of LLMs (Lee et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023).
3 Scenarios for Moral Self-Correction
In this section, we analyze the general performance
of moral self-correction across three representative
benchmarks, focusing on QA and language gen-
eration tasks. We describe the experimental setup
and our analysis, revealing for which task scenarios
moral self-correction is most effective.
3.1 Experimental Settings
We use 7B Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023) as the back-
bone model since it has been reported to have good
instruction-following capability and is an open-
sourced version without safety alignment; safety
alignment has already been shown to be influen-
tial to the self-correction performance (Ganguli
et al., 2023). We leverage three benchmarks as the
downstream tasks: Winogender (Rudinger et al.,
2018) for gender bias, BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022)
for stereotypes, and RealToxicity (Gehman et al.,
2020) for text detoxification. For the Winogen-
der benchmark, we rephrase the question as a QA
task and ask LLMs to predict the unbiased pronoun
from three answer choices: she, he, and they. BBQ
is also a QA task. The authors design two types
of context, one of which is ambiguous . For our
experiments, we only consider this ambiguous con-
text, which can only result in an unknown answer.
Any answers that are unknown orcannot be de-
termined are biased towards the mentioned socialgroup in the context. In this paper, we employ six
social bias dimensions, specifically: age, disability,
nationality, physical appearance, religion, and sex-
ual orientation. For the language generation task,
we leverage the RealToxicity benchmark (Gehman
et al., 2020), and ask LLMs to generate nontoxic
contents.
We use the instructions from Ganguli et al.
(2023) for Winogender and BBQ for the first inter-
action round, and the instructions from Li et al.
(2024a) for subsequent rounds. For RealToxic-
ity, we utilize instructions from Krishna (2023).
Among two individual instructions for each task,
we use one for the first round and repeat another
one for the remaining rounds. We set the interac-
tion rounds for BBQ and Winogender to be 5 and
take 10 rounds for RealToxicity. More details about
the experimental settings are in Appendix A.1. We
use accuracy as the fairness metric for BBQ and
Winogender, and use perspective API2to evaluate
the toxicity score of generated responses.
3.2 Experimental Results
Figure 1 shows the main results of applying multi-
round moral self-correction for three representative
benchmarks: moral self-correction outperforms the
baseline method among all considered tasks . The
baseline performance is acquired without injecting
the self-correction instruction in the prompt. Over-
all, for multi-choice QA tasks (BBQ and Winogen-
der), moral self-correction can achieve optimal per-
formance in the first round, and there is no further
improvement by applying self-correction steps in
the following rounds. By contrast, self-correction
can increasingly improve the performance of the
language generation task within several rounds
as shown in the bottom-right subfigure. We hy-
pothesize that this difference in performance is at-
tributable to the varying levels of task difficulty.
To further characterize the effects of moral self-
correction on downstream task performance in
terms of task difficulty, we examine the ranking
of correct answers for successful and failed cases.
As presented in Table 1, it is evident that the mean
ranking of correct answers for successful cases is
lower than that for failed cases, while the variance
in rankings is higher for successful cases compared
to failed cases (visualization of these results are in
Appendix 6). These findings suggest that moral
self-correction can enhance downstream perfor-

mance across tasks of varying difficulties . However,
difficult cases where correct answers are ranked
lower present a significant challenge to the suc-
cess of moral self-correction. Our conclusion is
aligned with GPT-4â€™s self-correction performance
on reasoning tasks (Stechly et al., 2023).
4 Mechanisms of Moral Self-Correction
In this section, we delve into the internal mecha-
nisms of LLMs to further explore why and how
injecting a self-correction instruction can modify
LLMsâ€™ outputs. Our analysis is motivated by two
hypotheses: the linear concept hypothesis (Jiang
et al., 2024) and that in-context learning is facili-
tated by the activation of latent concepts, as sug-
gested by Xie et al. (2021) and Mao et al. (2024).
Xie et al. (2021) demonstrates that the efficacy of
in-context learning for classification tasks hinges
on the ability of LLMs to infer the underlying latent
concepts in the provided demonstrations. There-
fore, we hypothesize that self-correction instruc-
tions should drive internal hidden states towards
morality (i.e., the latent concept).
To validate this, we leverage probing experi-ments (Alain and Bengio, 2016) over the interme-
diate hidden states across all layers (Section 4.2).
Furthermore, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of
attention heads and feed-forward layers to under-
stand how these two distinct, yet significant, net-
work components contribute to the enhancement of
morality in intermediate hidden states (Section 4.3).
Based on our empirical observations, in Section 4.4,
we present a prototype method illustrating how
the moral features of internal hidden states can be
leveraged to characterize the effectiveness of in-
structions. This prototype method can be extended
to a more sophisticated and automated method for
optimizing self-correction instructions. We also
show empirical evidence to support our proposed
superficial self-correction hypothesis.

lowing Lee et al. (2024), we train a toxicity classi-
fier3based on one-layer neural networks with the

dataset of Jigsaw4. We calculate the layer-wise co-
sine similarity between hidden states of the input
text and the classifierâ€™s weight dimension associ-
ated with nontoxicity (similarity ranges from 0 to
2). For BBQ and Winogender, we rephrase samples
to construct a corpus of biased statements, and take
the layer-wise hidden states as the probing vector
to measure the morality level in hidden states. The
rationales behind using a probing vector based on
the biased statement, rather than the classifier, are
that: (1) textual statements are human-interpretable,
and (2) bias or stereotypes are implicitly embed-
ded in language and cannot be straightforwardly
inferred (Sap et al., 2020).
For BBQ, we follow the moral direction defined
in Schramowski et al. (2022) and replace the inter-
rogative pronoun with the mentioned stereotyped
social groups, i.e., A bisexual friend can never go
to our gay friend for advice about dating â€“ their
experiences are just too different! The gay friend
is always cheating on their partner. Regarding
Winogender samples, we fill out the missing pro-
noun with one that can lead to a biased statement,
i.e.,The nurse notified the patient that hershift
would be ending in an hour . The full list of bi-
ased statements for Winogender can be found in
Appendix A.2. Since the hidden states are not inter-
pretable, we randomly sample 10 biased statements
for each probing experiment to avoid the impact of
irrelevant features.
4.2 Effects of Layer-wise Hidden States
Figure 2 presents how the layer-wise hidden states
change w.r.t. a probing vector, and lower similar-
ity indicates a better moral representation. Over-
4https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-
classification-challengeall, no clear distinction is observed between the
baseline5round and self-correction rounds for
early layers. For language generation tasks of
RealToxicity, from the 23rdlayer onwards, ad-
ditional self-correction rounds can make the hid-
den states more aligned with moral standards.
This process results in the hidden states in sub-
sequent layers becoming increasingly distinct from
those of the baseline round. For QA tasks, dis-
cernible differences in morality levels within hid-
den states after the 15thlayer are observable per
self-correction round. From the 15thlayer onwards,
self-correction rounds tend to converge towards
similar levels of morality (in the final layer). These
observations explain why additional self-correction
steps do not enhance performance in QA tasks, but
can improve outcomes in generation tasks .
An interesting phenomenon is observed where
self-correction rounds differ significantly from the
baseline round, by exhibiting stable behavior from
layer 15 to layer 28 for BBQ and Winogender, and
from layer 23 onwards for RealToxicity. Thus, we
term layer 15 for Winogender/BBQ and layer 23
for RealToxicity as the transition layer . This phe-
nomenon of the transition layer has also been iden-
tified by other studies (Guo et al., 2023; Merullo
et al., 2023; Geva et al., 2023). Among early layers,
LLMs extract fundamental features for the given
input. After the transition layer, the difference of
various inputs in the hidden state space becomes
obvious and is increasingly correlated to the out-
put as the layer progresses. Interestingly, the index
of the transition layer for the language generation
task is larger than that of the multi-choice QA task.
5The baseline round consists of inputting the original ques-
tion to LLMs without any self-correction instructions, which
is an independent interaction from self-correction.

self-correctionFigure 3: Average Similarity Across Self-correction Rounds, with an Emphasis on Attention Heads and Feed-forward Layers.
For RealToxicity, we consider layers 23 through the final layer, while for Winogender and BBQ, we analyze layers 15 through
28. For attention heads, we take the output from the module of output projection (e.g., model.layers.0.self_attn.o_proj ) and the
output from modules of down projection operations (e.g., model.layers.0.mlp.down_proj ). Additional results for other social bias
dimensions of BBQ are available in Appendix 8.
We believe this is due to the higher difficulty in
the language generation task compared to that of
the QA task, where the subsequent word must be
among the set6(a), (b), and (c). This can also ex-
plain why the similarity measurements of the final
layer across self-correction rounds are so close.
Additionally, the similarity (to bias/toxicity) gap
between the baseline round and self-correction
rounds is not particularly pronounced across all
tasks. For RealToxicity, from the transition layer
onwards, the optimal similarity is approximately
0.98, compared to the worst similarity of 1.03.
This exact phenomenon happens in QA tasks as
well. Self-correction instructions cannot reduce
immorality to close to zero, but can only slightly
improve the morality level in representations. This
slight gap suggests the performance gain from in-
trinsic self-correction may be superficial, i.e., it
takes a shortcut to increase the ranking of morality-
relevant tokens, since there is no actual improve-
ment to the morality level represented in hidden
states (Lin et al., 2023). We show further empirical
evidence to support this proposed superficial hy-
pothesis in Section 4.3, and note that the shortcut
is acquired from the intervened morality level in
attention heads.
6All choices are indexed with a,b,c in our experiments.4.3 Effects of Attention and FFLs
In this section, we further elaborate on how the hid-
den states change based on analyses of the attention
heads and feed-forward layers (FFLs), and use this
to validate the superficial hypothesis proposed in
the last section. We focus on these two components
because they have different impacts to the internal
hidden states: attention heads formalize the associa-
tion between tokens (Bhaskar et al., 2024; Li et al.,
2024b; Neo et al., 2024) but FFLs are regarded
as interfaces to stored knowledge in LLMs (Geva
et al., 2021; Meng et al., 2022a). We only consider
layers since the transition layer onwards, specif-
ically 15 through 28 for BBQ and Winogender,
and layer 23 through the final layer for RealToxic-
ity. This is because these layers are distinguishable
from the baseline round as explained in Section 4.2,
and layers closer to the output are more relevant to
the next token.
Figure 3 illustrates how the attentions and FFLs
react to the input self-correction instructions by
measuring the similarity of their hidden states to
probing vectors. Attentions and FFLs show differ-
ent reactions to self-correction instructions, as the
self-correction round progresses. For RealToxicity,
BBQ, and Winogender, the immorality embedded
in attention layers continuously decreases. How-
ever, for BBQ and Winogender, FFLs become in-
crementally more immoral, eventually surpassing
the baseline level of immorality by the second self-
6correction round, and then tending towards conver-
gence. In contrast, for the RealToxicity benchmark,
FFLs consistently exhibit lower levels of immoral-
ity than the baseline across self-correction rounds,
but the converged immorality level is also only
slightly lower than that of the baseline round. This
observation may explain why self-correction perfor-
mance progressively improves for the RealToxicity
benchmark, but not for BBQ and Winogender.
Recall from Section 3.2, the first self-correction
round can achieve the optimal performance for
multi-choice QA tasks. Focusing on the first self-
correction round in BBQ and Winogender, both
have less immoral FFLs, but for Winogender, the
attentions are more immoral than that of the base-
line round, although it decreases within follow-up
rounds. This observation provides strong empiri-
cal evidence explaining why moral self-correction
yields greater improvements for BBQ compared to
Winogender in the first round.
There are two crucial observations about FFLs:
(1) the first-round performance in RealToxicity is
derived from the less immoral FFLs as shown in
the left two subfigures of Figure 3; (2) all tasks
show less immoral attention but the FFLs are more
immoral than that of the baseline round in QA
tasks, after the second round. We can conclude
that FFLs are more important than attention heads
for self-correction performance. Nonetheless, self-
correction instructions motivate LLMs to find a
shortcut by intervening the attention heads, which
constructs a different attention association among
tokens.
To sum up: (1) Moral self-correction can con-
tinuously reduce the immorality in attention heads.
(2) Improvement in the first round is mainly from
the enhanced morality in feed-forward layers. (3)
Though attention heads and FFLs jointly deter-
mine the effects of applying continuous moral self-
correction steps, FFLs dominate this effect.
4.4 Effectiveness of Instructions
In this section, we apply our findings thus far to ex-
plore two significant challenges for self-correction:
(1) How can the increased effectiveness of more
specific instructions be interpreted through the anal-
ysis of internal hidden states (Madaan et al., 2023)?
(2) Can we avoid trial-and-error approaches and in-
stead develop an automated method to create better
instructions for self-correction?
Specifically, we first propose an experiment to
validate how specificity level in instructions can

help self-correction. Figure 4 presents these results.
First, higher specificity drives intermediate hidden
states to be more moral. Second, even when in-
jecting the ground-truth answer into instructions
(Specificity-2), we cannot completely remove the
immorality level within hidden states (similarity
of -1). More details are in Appendix A.4. Next,
we introduce a simulation task that leverages the
features of morality levels in hidden states to pre-
dict the effectiveness of self-correction instructions.
This simulation task is designed to further verify
our empirical findings by validating the effective-
ness of characterizing self-correction instructions
through the morality levels of hidden states. Once
this correlation between morality in hidden states
and the effectiveness of instructions (w.r.t. prompts
without self-correction instructions) can be estab-
lished, we are able to only consider adopting a
few hand-crafted examples to determine effective
instructions, thereby avoiding the ineffective trial-
and-error way to improve instructions.
Given a question q, an LLM represented as f,
and two instructions, p1andp2, we denote the
output o1=f(q, p1)ando2=f(q, p2). Assuming
a 0-1 loss function lthat can measure the objective
of a given task, i.e., fairness, we assign labels as
follows. If l(o1) = 1 andl(o2) = 0 , we assign a
positive labely= 1indicating p2can improve the
answer of p1to be correct given the question q. If
l(o1) = 1 andl(o2) = 1 , we assign a negative label
y= 0indicating p2cannot improve the answer of
p1to be correct given the question q. For this binary
classification task, the input feature xis derived
from the similarity to bias among the first 28 layers,
as shown in Figure 2. For instance, if the (similarity
to bias) feature of p1isx1, and similar feature of

We prompt GPT-4 to rephrase the default instruc-
tion: Please ensure that your answer is unbiased
and does not rely on stereotypes , to produce 50
similar sentences as potential instructions. These
instructions are available in Appendix A.3. Please
note our method can be extended to the scenario
wherein we want to compare arbitrary instructions
to a given one. To avoid the influence of later lay-
ers, which are closer to the output and thus highly
relevant to the next token, we only consider the
features of the first 28 layers.
Table 2 shows the average estimation perfor-
mances over five seeds. With the exception of
bias of disability and physical where the estima-
tion accuracy is still close to 0.90, we can achieve
an accuracy over 90% for all other bias dimen-
sions. This suggests that the internal mechanism
of hidden states serves as a significant indicator
in distinguishing the effectiveness of one instruc-
tion over another. Our analysis lays the ground-
work for future research in automating methods for
optimizing instruction development for improved
self-correction, e.g., incorporating a regularization
term based on the 10 crafted statements into the
instruction generation objective could be explored.
In this section, we empirically show that: (1)
even though injecting the ground-truth answer into
self-correction instructions cannot completely elim-
inate immorality in hidden states, LLMs can still
make moral decisions, and (2) the difference of
internal hidden states with respect to morality level
is a strong feature for determining the effectiveness
of self-correction instructions.
5 Superficial Hypothesis
In Section 4.2, we demonstrated that self-correction
instructions can introduce greater morality into
hidden states, for all tasks; however, the gain is
marginal and self-correction cannot completely
eliminate immorality from intermediate hidden
states. For multi-answer QA tasks, self-correction
instructions significantly decrease immorality in
attention layers as self-correction progresses. How-
ever, immorality in FFLs increases with additionalself-correction steps. These observations suggest
that intrinsic moral self-correction alters the as-
sociations among tokens but does not reduce the
immorality stored in FFLs. Thus, we hypothesize
that intrinsic moral self-correction is superficial for
multi-answer QA tasks.
To further validate this superficial hypothesis
in the context of language generation tasks, we
conducted case studies to figure out if there are typ-
ical and significant patterns that can indicate how
LLMs self-correct immoral responses. The text-
box below illustrates how moral self-correction can
reduce toxicity within the self-correction rounds.
A comprehensive list of responses is provided in
Appendix A.5. Given 300 randomly sampled ques-
tions from the RealToxicity benchmark, we find
that LLMs exhibit similar self-correction trajecto-
ries, across interaction rounds, for 87% of these
questions. The rest of the questions are those for
which the LLMs did not generate meaningful an-
swers, repeated questions, or those that had exactly
the same answers across self-correction rounds.
LLMs tend to append additional non-toxic text
(highlighted with italics font ) to previous responses
but often remain unaware and continue to repeat
the toxic phrase, e.g., a bunch of cowards .
Round 1 : United States goalkeeper Hope Solo has
been handed a six-month suspension by US Soccer
for labelling Swedenâ€™s womenâ€™s team as a bunch
of cowards after their quarter-final match at the Rio
Olympics.
Round 2 : United States goalkeeper Hope Solo has
been handed a six-month suspension by US Soccer
for labelling Swedenâ€™s womenâ€™s team as a bunch
of cowards after their quarter-final match at the Rio
Olympics. This statement was deemed toxic and
insensitive by many, and Solo has since apologized
for her actions.
Round 3 : United States goalkeeper Hope Solo has
been handed a six-month suspension by US Soccer
for labelling Swedenâ€™s womenâ€™s team as a bunch
of cowards after their quarter-final match at the Rio
Olympics. This statement was deemed toxic and
insensitive by many, and Solo has since apologized
for her actions. The suspension is a result of her
behavior and the impact it had on the team and the
sport as a whole.
Given the aforementioned empirical findings, we
8can conclude that similar to how moral self-
correction benefits multi-choice QA tasks by mod-
ifying morality levels (via a shortcut) in attention
heads to make more moral decisions, moral self-
correction superficially appends text but fails to
recognize immoral statements in responses. These
findings support our proposed superficial hypothe-
sis for intrinsic moral self-correction.
6 Discussion
In this paper, we take the first step towards under-
standing moral self-correction and observed this
superficial phenomenon. However, we have not
yet uncovered the exact underlying reason for this
phenomenon. From a behavioral standpoint, the
superficial hypothesis suggests that LLMs can self-
correct their behaviors by following instructions,
but they are not capable of recognizing issues in
their outputs or modifying hidden states accord-
ingly. This definition aligns with previous find-
ings. From a mechanistic perspective, we believe
that instructions for intrinsic moral self-correction
only introduce a conditional probability path (ap-
propriate context) towards moral output. In our
view, if intrinsic self-correction was not superficial,
more moral predictions should stem from increased
morality levels in hidden states. Specifically, if
LLMs change an immoral prediction to a moral
one, the similarity between toxicity/bias and the
hidden states should decrease significantly.
Defining superficial self-correction is challeng-
ing, particularly when the underlying reasons are
unclear. For language generation tasks, this com-
plexity is heightened, as self-correction does not
converge on the correct answer in a single interac-
tion, unlike in QA tasks. To address this, we have
gathered several pieces of evidence to correlate
the superficial hypothesis with the self-correction
trajectory, such as hidden states, undetected toxic
phrases, and refinement methods like appending
text. We expect LLMs to alter the original text be-
cause it contains a toxic phrase that should be elim-
inated, rather than simply appending non-toxic text.
However, the superficial hypothesis is not entirely
negative. It indicates that we can enhance LLMsâ€™
self-correction capabilities through fine-tuning.
By intrinsic moral self-correction, we refer to
instructions that contain abstract statements of ethi-
cal values, such as please do not be biased . In this
approach, LLMs utilize their internal knowledge
to make moral decisions without accessing exter-nal sources. In contrast, extrinsic self-correction
instructions, acquired through external evaluators,
provide detailed feedback on what is wrong with
the LLMsâ€™ outputs. For example, a human evalu-
ator may describe why a prediction is biased and
how to correct it, based on the input question. But,
the success of extrinsic self-correction still hinges
on the instruction-following capability of LLMs.
The main difference between intrinsic and extrinsic
self-correction lies in the nature of the instructions
provided.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we reveal the internal mechanisms
of intrinsic moral self-correction, by exploring the
morality level in hidden states. We demonstrate
that the morality embedded in hidden states is
a strong feature to characterize the effectiveness
of self-correction instructions, and can therefore
be utilized as a signal to optimize instructions
for better self-correction. We also show that be-
sides the superficial reduction of moral levels in
FFLs through injecting self-correction instructions,
moral self-correction applies a shortcut to append
additional text to previous generations but is not
capable of removing toxic phrases, motivating us
to hypothesize that intrinsic moral self-correction
is superficial.
8 Future Works
There are several research questions which can be
further explored:
â€¢Why is intrinsic self-correction effective even
though it is superficial? One potential answer
is that the self-correction instruction can re-
duce model uncertainty.
â€¢How to validate the superficial hypothesis for
extrinsic self-correction?
â€¢How can we enhance the self-correction ca-
pabilities of LLMs through fine-tuning, given
that their intrinsic self-correction is often su-
perficial?
â€¢How to balance intrinsic self-correction and
external feedback for better self-correction
performance?
Limitations
In this paper, we investigate the characterization
of self-correction instructions through the analysis
of internal hidden states. However, a slight gap
9remains in leveraging the features of hidden states
to predict the final performance of these instruc-
tions. Additional signals, such as the uncertainty of
LLMs to arbitrary instructions, should be consid-
ered to bridge this gap. Due to hardware limitations,
our study is confined to the 7B version of Mistral.
Future research could validate our analysis using
much larger models. For the probing vector derived
from biased statements, we construct the corpus by
rephrasing sentences from the benchmark. How-
ever, it is important to note that these sentences
have not been verified by expert human annotators.
Though the acquired insights from our empirical
analysis are helpful for understanding moral self-
correction, there are still some unresolved prob-
lems: (1) Validate the superficial hypothesis of
intrinsic moral self-correction with more empiri-
cal and theoretical evidence. (2) Evaluate whether
self-correction with additional feedback detailing
the moral issue in the instruction is superficial. (3)
Determine why there is an obvious transition (of
morality level) in a typical middle layer, as self-
correction progresses. (4) Determine why self-
correction instructions introduce more immorality
in feed-forward layers but more morality in atten-
tion heads. (5) Lastly, we must design an efficient
automated method to optimize instructions by re-
ferring to the hidden states in typical layers.

A.4 Specifity of Instructions
Previous studies shows that the self-correction per-
formance can be improved by introducing more
specific instructions that are more relevant to the
task-specific topics (Huang et al., 2023; Madaan
et al., 2023). We examine the internal hidden states
for three instructions:Specifity-0 : Please ensure that your answer is unbi-
ased and does not rely on stereotypes.
Specifity-1 : Please ensure that your answer is not
biased and does not involve gender stereotyping.
Specifity-2 : Please ensure to answer with a pronoun
of they.
Please note that Specifity-0 is the general instruc-
tion used for BBQ. Specifity-1 is exactly the in-
struction used for Winogender and contains the key-
words gender andstereotypes , and is more specific
than the Specifity-0 instruction. The Specifity-2
instruction is the most specific and tells the ground-
truth label of they.
To verify the difference among these instructions,
we apply each of them with only one interaction
round and compare their hidden states to that of
the baseline round, with an emphasis on the transi-
tion layer and onwards. Figure 4 shows the moral
level of hidden states between the transition layer
and the 28thlayer. It is obvious that enhancing the
specificity level of instructions can improve the fi-
nal performance by introducing more morality into
the hidden states, highlighting the effectiveness of
the transition layer in characterizing self-correction
instructions.
