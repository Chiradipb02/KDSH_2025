Abstract
Solidarity is a crucial concept to understand
social relations in societies. In this paper, we
explore fine-grained solidarity frames to study
solidarity towards women and migrants in Ger-
man parliamentary debates between 1867 and
2022. Using 2,864 manually annotated text
snippets (with a cost exceeding 18k Euro), we
evaluate large language models (LLMs) like
Llama 3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. We find that
GPT-4 outperforms other LLMs, approaching
human annotation quality. Using GPT-4, we
automatically annotate more than 18k further
instances (with a cost of around 500 Euro)
across 155 years and find that solidarity with
migrants outweighs anti-solidarity but that fre-
quencies and solidarity types shift over time.
Most importantly, group-based notions of (anti-
)solidarity fade in favor of compassionate soli-
darity, focusing on the vulnerability of migrant
groups, and exchange-based anti-solidarity, fo-
cusing on the lack of (economic) contribution.
Our study highlights the interplay of histori-
cal events, socio-economic needs, and politi-
cal ideologies in shaping migration discourse
and social cohesion. We also show that power-
ful LLMs, if carefully prompted, can be cost-
effective alternatives to human annotation for
hard social scientific tasks.
1 Introduction
Solidarity is a crucial concept for understanding
how societies achieve and maintain stability and
cohesion (Reynolds, 2014), and it plays a critical
role in shaping policies (Laitinen and Pessi, 2014).
Traditionally, solidarity relied on common identity
and reciprocity, potentially excluding out-groups
like migrants (Hopman and Knijn, 2022) and re-
inforcing social boundaries and hierarchies (An-
thias, 2014). However, growing diversity and in-
creasing socio-economic, political, religious, and
cultural complexities of modern societies (Kym-
licka, 2020) call such traditional forms of solidar-
ity into question. Simultaneously, recent populist

The scheme categorizes statements into solidarity ,anti-
solidarity ,mixed , and none (high-level). At the fine-
grained level, solidarity andanti-solidarity are further
divided into group-based ,exchange-based ,compassion-
ate, and empathic subtypes.
movements challenge policies that support equality,
such as equal opportunity or reproductive rights of
women (Inglehart and Norris, 2016). These evolv-
ing complexities motivate a deeper and broader
study of social solidarity, namely (i) a fine-grained
exploration of different forms of social solidarity
to reflect its multifaceted nature (Oosterlynck and
Bouchaute, 2013), and (ii) a broader historical anal-
ysis to trace its evolution from the 19th century to
today (Banting and Kymlicka, 2017). In this work,
we contribute to such a systematic study of solidar-
ity by tracing fine-grained notions of solidarity and
anti-solidarity towards two target groups, women
and migrants, in political speech, namely German
parliamentary debates from 1867 to 2022 (Walter
et al., 2021). We employ the social solidarity frame-
work by Thijssen (2012) that incorporates rational
(group-based andexchange-based ) and emotivearXiv:2210.04359v3  [cs.CL]  21 Nov 2024Gold Standard Translation of the Original German Text
(1)Compassionate solidarity
towards women
(June 29, 1961)“In connection with § 1708 BGB, the Bundestag has set the age of 18 as the limit for
the obligation to provide maintenance. In the transitional provisions, this stipulation
has been repealed for those who had already reached the age of 16 on January 1,
1962. My faction finds this regulation unfair, as it would exempt significant groups of
people from this maintenance obligation. Especially women who have made great
efforts to send their children to higher education, for example, would have to
bear these costs alone. [...]”
(2)Exchange-based
anti-solidarity towards migrants
(Apr. 19, 2018)“[...] Let me also add: Migration is not necessarily successful – you always act
as if that is great – it can fail, and it fails in particular when the immigrants’
qualifications are low. In 2013, before the so-called refugee wave, 40 percent of
immigrants from non-EU countries had no qualifications. Since the wave of refugees,
stabbings have increased by 20 percent, and we have imported anti-Semitism in the
country. Does this make for an outstandingly successful migration?”
(3)Mixed stance towards
migrants
(Feb. 2, 1982)“[...] We must accept that in a few years we will again need a higher number of
foreign workers in the Federal Republic, as Mr. Urbaniak hinted earlier. In reality,
therefore, we must commit to effective integration, which admittedly requires
[...] that there can be no exceptions, no alternative, regarding the recruitment
stop and the prevention of illegal immigration . [...]”
(4)None case (women)
(June 17, 2015)“[...] ‘We want to be free people!’ There is probably no better phrase to open today’s
debate here in the German Bundestag about the popular uprising of 1953. [...] We
remember women and men who, 62 years ago, showed great courage because
they wanted to change the course of their country’s development and their own
lives, because they wanted to be free people. ”

none, are available in Table 3 in the Appendix.
(compassionate andempathic ) elements of solidar-
ity (refer to Fig. 1 and Section 4 for more details
on the typology). We focus on migrants, central for
solidarity discourse in European and German poli-
tics (Thränhardt, 1993; Faist, 1994; Fröhlich, 2023;
Lehr, 2015), and women as an “oppressed majority”
historically marginalized from public life (Calloni,
2020). As manual annotation of (anti-)solidarity
concepts in all parliamentary proceedings over this
155-year period using traditional sociological meth-
ods is practically infeasible, we explore the use of
language models for this complex task. In par-
ticular, we assess the efficacy of BERT, Llama-3,
GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, to detect expressions of var-
ious (anti-)solidarity types in parliamentary texts,
aiming to identify the best performing model for
our large-scale analysis. From an NLP perspective,
this task is semantically and pragmatically chal-
lenging because, (i) expressions of (anti-)solidarity
are often implied rather than explicitly stated in the
text and their meaning is affected by the political
and historical context in which they are made (see
the examples in Table 1; Sravanthi et al., 2024); (ii)
German data, especially evolving German language
over 155 years, is under-represented in common
training data sets for LLMs, which may affect per-
formance (Ahuja et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024; Liuet al., 2024); and (iii) LLMs might struggle with an-
notating complex sociological concepts, achieving
lower quality and reliability compared to human
annotators (Wang et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2022;
Zhu et al., 2023; Pangakis et al., 2023).
Our contributions are: (i) We provide a human
annotated training & evaluation dataset of 2,864
text snippets, which required 40+ hours weekly
from 4-5 annotators over nine months, totaling an
investment of approximately 18k Euro; (ii) we con-
duct a comparative analysis of LLMs on a complex
sociological task in which pre-trained language
models (esp. GPT-4) outperform an open-source
model Llama-3-70B-Instruct, as well as models
fine-tuned for this task (BERT, GPT-3.5 fine tuned);
(iii) we provide fine-grained insights into solidarity
discourse concerning migrants in Germany in the
last 155 years across different political parties.

Our work connects to (i) computational social sci-
ence (CSS) (ii) analysis of political data (parlia-
mentary debates) and (iii) the emergent field of
analysis of social solidarity using NLP approaches.NLP-based CSS. Recent CSS studies have lever-
aged LLMs for a variety of complex tasks. Ziems
et al. (2024) conduct a comprehensive evalua-
tion of LLMs, pointing out their weaknesses in
tasks which require understanding of subjective
expert taxonomies that deviate from the training
data of LLMs (such as implicit hate and empa-
thy classification). LLMs enhance text-as-data
methods in social sciences, particularly in ana-
lyzing political ideology (Wu et al., 2023), but
struggle with social language understanding, of-
ten outperformed by fine-tuned models (Choi et al.,
2023). Zhang et al. (2023) introduced SPARROW,
a benchmark showing ChatGPT’s limitations in
sociopragmatic understanding across languages.
In exploring German migration debates, Blokker
et al. (2020) and Zaberer et al. (2023) utilize fine-
tuning of transformer-based language models to
classify claims in German newspapers. Chen et al.
(2022) apply LLM-based classification on German
social media posts to study public controversies
over the course of one decade. In contrast to these
approaches, we apply LLMs to longitudinal histor-
ical data and explore it for a new challenging task,
fine-grained detection of social solidarity.
Analysis of parliamentary debates using NLP
tools. Abercrombie and Batista-Navarro (2020a)
review 61 studies on sentiment and position-taking
within parliamentary contexts, covering dictionary-
based sentiment scoring, statistical machine learn-
ing, and other conventional NLP methods. In
terms of specific methodologies, studies often de-
ploy: (i) shallow classifiers, where Lai et al. (2020)
use SVM, Naïve Bayes, and Logistic Regression
for multilingual stance detection; (ii) deep learn-
ing approaches, with Abercrombie and Batista-
Navarro (2020b) applying BERT, Al Hamoud et al.
(2022) exploring LSTM variants, and Sawhney
et al. (2020) introducing GPolS for political speech
analysis; (iii) probabilistic models, as in Vilares
and He (2017)’s Bayesian approach to identify top-
ics and perspectives in debates. With German po-
litical debates, Müller-Hansen et al. (2021) use
topic modeling to study shifts in German parlia-
mentary discussions on coal due to changes in en-
ergy policy, while Walter et al. (2021) employ di-
achronic word embeddings to track antisemitic and
anti-communist biases in these debates. More re-
cently, Bornheim et al. (2023) apply Llama 2 to
automate speaker attribution in German parliamen-
tary debates from 2017-2021. Our research goesbeyond this by adopting recent powerful LLMs to
track changes of a specific social concept, solidar-
ity, in plenary debates from three centuries.
Social solidarity in NLP. Previous studies of so-
cial solidarity in NLP have largely focused on so-
cial media platforms. For example, Santhanam
et al. (2019) study how emojis are used to express
solidarity in social media during Hurricane Irma
in 2017 and Paris terrorist attacks from November
2015. Ils et al. (2021) consider solidarity in Eu-
ropean social media discourse around COVID-19.
Eger et al. (2022) extend this work by examining
how design choices, like keyword selection and
language, affect assessments of solidarity changes
over time. Compared to these works, we use a
similar methodological setup (annotate data and
infer trends), but focus on parliamentary debates
instead of social media, employ a much more fine-
grained sociological framework (Thijssen, 2012),
and use LLMs for systematic categorization and
examination of solidarity types over time.
3 Data
We obtain data from two sources: (i) Open Data ,
covering Bundestag (en.: federal diet) protocols
from 1949 until today; and (ii) Reichstagspro-
tokolle covering Reichstag (en.: imperial diet) pro-
tocols until 1945.1We use the OCR-scanned ver-
sion from Walter et al. (2021). Links to data, mod-
els, etc. used are in Appendix D. For the Reichstag
data, we apply preprocessing steps similar to Walter
et al. (2021) (e.g., removal of OCR artifacts), but
keep German umlauts, capitalization, and punctua-
tion. We automatically split the data into individual
sittings and collect metadata like the date, period
and number of each sitting, which we manually
check and correct. Additionally, we removed in-
terjections and split the text into sentences using
NLTK (Bird et al., 2009), resulting in 19.1M sen-
tences. We release this dataset of plenary protocols
from German political debates (DeuParl) consisting
of 9,923 sittings from 1867 to 2022 on GitHub.2
To select keywords, we (i) train a Word2Vec
model (Mikolov et al., 2013) on our dataset to iden-
tify words with vector representations similar to
Migrant (en.: migrant) and Frau (en.: woman); (ii)
manually expand this list with intuitively relevant
terms; (iii) from both lists, we filter for those which
1Volkskammer (en.: Eastern German parliament) protocols
could not be included due to lack of availability.
2https://github.com/DominikBeese/DeuParl-v2appear at least 200 times in the dataset. This re-
sulted in 32 keywords for Migrant and 18 keywords
forFrau . These include general terms like Migrant ,
Immigrant andFrau to period-specific terms, such
asVertriebene (en.: expellees) and Bürgerkriegs-
flüchtlinge (en.: civil war refugees), or social roles,
such as Mütter (en.: mothers) and Hausfrauen
(en.: housewives). See the full list of keywords,
and further preprocessing in Appendix A. For a de-
tailed keyword distribution across the dataset, see
Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 in the Appendix.
Using these keywords, we extract 58k main
sentences ( instances ) for migrants and 131k for
women from DeuParl, expanding each with three
preceding and three following sentences for con-
text, resulting in a total of (i) 463k sentences
(9.79M tokens) for migrants and (ii) 1.58M sen-
tences (32.82M tokens) for women. Fig. 2 shows
the number of instances over time.3Fig. 7 in the
Appendix shows yearly relative frequencies of sen-
tences with terms related to women and migrants
in the entire dataset. It is notable that both Frau
andMigrant terms represent a minor fraction of the
discourse, typically under 0.02. Periodic spikes in
mentions likely align with historical and societal
changes, such as post-WWII for Migrant .

4 Data annotation
To obtain ground truth data for model training and
evaluation, we annotated 2864 instances with five
annotators (all student assistants, with specializa-
tions in social science or computer science). The
annotation was performed over a duration of nine
months. In the first three months, we iteratively
3We note that the dataset is sparse in the period from 1933
to 1949, i.e. during the NS dictatorship and the immediate
after-war period until the first parliament after the war was
elected in 1949.refined the annotation guidelines and monitored
the inter-rater agreement (measured by Cohen’s
Kappa) until inter-rater agreement converged (see
Section 4.2 for exact scores) and annotators began
annotating independently.
4.1 Annotation task design
For the manual annotation, we take the target sen-
tence and three preceding and following sentences
for context into account. We first select a high-level
category ( solidarity ,anti-solidarity ,mixed ,none ).
Solidarity oranti-solidarity cases are then further
distinguished into frames as defined by Thijssen
and Verheyen (2022): group-based ,compassionate ,
exchange-based , and empathic . We describe each
of the included variables below.
High-level categories. Based on Lahusen and
Grasso (2018) and Ils et al. (2021), we define sol-
idarity as willingness to share resources, directly
or indirectly, or support for target groups, and anti-
solidarity as statements restricting resources, show-
ing unwillingness to support, or implying exclusion
of these groups. Texts with both supporting and op-
posing expressions are labeled mixed , while neutral
or unrelated texts are labeled none .
Group-based solidarity is coded for texts em-
phasizing shared identity and common goals
among group members, whereas group-based anti-
solidarity emphasizes out-group exclusion based
on perceived differences.
Compassionate solidarity is coded for texts sup-
porting marginalized groups, emphasizing their
need for protection, while compassionate anti-
solidarity dismisses these groups by considering
them already in a good position, minimizing their
need support or protection.
Exchange-based solidarity is coded when texts
highlight the economic contributions of “exchange
partners” and potential rewards or further contribu-
tions. Conversely, exchange-based anti-solidarity
calls for penalizing groups perceived as receiving
more than they contribute.
Empathic solidarity is coded when a speaker
expresses respect for individual differences, see-
ing social diversity as beneficial, while empathic
anti-solidarity arises when differences are used as
grounds for exclusion or neglect.
Annotation involved elaborate explanations,
with identification of (anti-)solidarity resourcesand highlighting expressions of (anti-)solidarity, as
well as self- (speaker’s own viewpoint) and other-
position (addressing or criticizing others’ view-
points). The full annotation process and a detailed
example are described in Appendix C and Fig. 15
in the Appendix, respectively.

Figure 3: Fig. 3a shows the confusion matrix between
human annotators; Fig. 3b shows agreement between
the best model and human annotators on a test set from
one of the three splits. The former is aggregated over
all pairwise comparisons of annotators, thus the matrix
is symmetric.
While initial agreement levels were low, by the
time annotators began working independently, they
achieved a pairwise agreement with a Cohen’s
Kappa of 0.42 on a fine-grained level and 0.62
on a high level. We observe three main disagree-
ment issues in annotation: misclassification of none
cases, confusion between mixed stance andanti-
solidarity , and overlap within solidarity and anti-
solidarity subtypes (see Fig. 6 in the Appendix).
This confusion is often due to overlapping charac-
teristics or the presence of multiple subtypes within
the text; moreover, this annotation task is inherently
subjective, which can lead to differing interpreta-
tions. This is further evidenced by our average
agreement scores. Table 6 in the Appendix pro-
vides examples of annotator divergence, explain-
ing why multiple labels could be correct, which
gives insight into more difficult instances. How-
ever, there was almost no confusion between sol-
idarity and anti-solidarity. We note less stability
in annotator agreement before 1930, stabilizing in
subsequent years (see Fig. 14a in the Appendix).
Although these variations can stem from the com-
plexities of historical language and diverse interpre-
tations of past events, they might also stem from
the unbalanced distribution of human annotated
data over the decades (see Fig. 4).Our dataset comprises 2864 annotated instances,
1437 for migrants and 1427 for women. We note
that anti-solidarity accounts for 13.5% of instances,
being more common among migrants (12.1%) than
women (1.4%) (see Table 5a in the Appendix). 368
instances in our dataset (referred to as curated )
were reviewed by a social science expert to provide
a reliable comparison benchmark for evaluation of
our models. Other consensus mechanisms for the fi-
nal labels in the human-annotated dataset, and their
distribution are shown in Table 5b in the Appendix.

5 Models and experiments
To determine the most cost-effective model
(both in terms of performance and costs) for our
large-scale sociological analysis, we evaluate var-
ious models, including Llama-3-70B-Instruct ,
gpt-4-1106-preview , base and instruction-
finetuned gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 , across high-level
and fine-grained (anti-)solidarity annotation tasks
in achieving human-level performance. Once the
quality of the models is assured, we apply the
best performing model — GPT-4 — large-scale to
determine trends in Section 7.
Data We use a 70/15/15 train/dev/test split for all
Migrant andWoman annotated data, which gives us
approx. 2000 train, 400 dev and 430 test instances.
We ensure reliability of a test set by allocating ap-
proximately 40% curated and 45% majority (labels
assigned when more than half of annotators agree
on the same label) labels. We create 3 random data
splits, and calculate performance metrics as the
average score of the 3 runs on the test sets.4
4These sets are fully used for training and evaluating base-
line models; for inference-based experiments with Llama-3,Metrics To evaluate our models, we report the
Macro F1 Score (Macro F1) to account for class
imbalance. We also calculate the F1 Score for the
classes individually. We report these metrics for
both high-level and fine-grained tasks.
5.1 Models
Baseline For our baseline, we use a BERT-based
pipeline with 110M parameters, comprising a high-
level category classifier and two subtype models
forsolidarity andanti-solidarity . All models share
a similar architecture, processing inputs with a tar-
get (Frau orMigrant ) and full text comprising the
focus sentence and left and right context. We add a
fully connected layer with softmax activation atop
the pooled output of the BERT-based models, with
4 output units for each model. To counter class im-
balance, minority classes are oversampled to parity
with the majority class. We finetune for 20 epochs
with a learning rate of 4e-4, a warmup ratio of 0.05,
linear decay, AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and
Hutter, 2017) and categorical crossentropy loss.
GPT-4 We design two prompts (one for each tar-
get group) that include several elements: (i) in-
corporating chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al.,
2022) in a few-shot setting by providing examples
with desired reasoning and asking to think step by
step in a zero-shot setting (Kojima et al., 2022);
(ii) providing precise definitions and insights de-
rived from annotation discussions; (iii) introducing
definitions and examples of potentially problem-
atic labels (such as empathic solidarity andem-
pathic anti-solidarity ) earlier in the prompt and (iv)
implementing a two-step prompting strategy that
initially categorizes texts at a high-level followed
by detailed subtype classification (full prompts are
provided in Fig. 16 and Fig. 17 in the Appendix).
Prompt-based fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Using the
prompt identified for GPT-4’s fine-grained clas-
sification, we proceeded to fine-tune GPT-3.5 on
instances sampled from our initial train set (114 for
migrants; 109 for women5), ensuring a balanced
distribution across labels. The fine-tuning dataset
was structured with the system providing instruc-
tions for classifying texts into high-level categories
and requesting further sub-categorization; the user
GPT-3.5, GPT-4, only test sets are used (also averaged on 3
runs).
5The fine-tuning guide by OpenAI recommends using 50 to
100 examples for training: https://platform.openai.com/
docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-datasetpresenting texts; and the assistant providing clas-
sifications as per our two-step reasoning approach,
along with explanations generated using GPT-4.
Llama-3 For an open-source model, we select
Llama-3-70B-Instruct with q6_kquantization
(Meta, 2024), tested in a zero-shot setting. We use
the same prompt as detailed in Fig. 16 and Fig. 17
in the Appendix, but involving separate calls for
high-level and subcategory classifications.
For all GPT experiments, we test the models in
few- (where we include ten category examples in
the prompt to demonstrate the desired reasoning
and categorization setting) and zero-shot settings.
6 Results
Results on the test sets are shown in Table 2 and
Table 7 in the Appendix.
GPT-4 consistently outperforms other models in
both fine-grained and high-level tasks for women
and migrants. Interestingly, GPT-4 achieves similar
performance in zero-shot and few-shot settings –
0.37 (0.60) and 0.37 (0.54) for women, and 0.42
(0.73) and 0.43 (0.63) for migrants, respectively,
where the first number represents the fine-grained,
and the number in parentheses the high-level score.
This might be attributed to the use of carefully
crafted definitions, which eliminates the need for
additional examples. The fine-tuned version of
GPT-3.5 demonstrates only marginal improvement
over the base model, generally falling short of GPT-
4’s performance. Most importantly, GPT-4 leads
in F1 scores across categories, effectively identi-
fying both solidarity and anti-solidarity (0.65 for
women and 0.87 for migrants in zero-shot settings,
see Table 7 in the Appendix). However, it scores
lowest in the mixed stance category, indicating
challenges with more complex and ambiguous in-
stances. Llama-3, on the other hand, outperforms
GPT-4 in this category for women and also leads in
thenone category for migrants by better identify-
ing contradicting and subtle cues, likely benefiting
from the two-step classification approach.
Conversely, BERT achieves lower F1 scores
across all categories, performing comparably to the
GPT-3.5 versions on high-level tasks but struggling
with fine-grained tasks and ambivalent categories
likemixed stance , likely due to challenges from
underrepresented labels such as anti-solidarity cat-
egories for women, even after over-sampling (see
Fig. 4, as well as Table 5a in the Appendix).ModelGPT-4 GPT-3.5 base Llama-3-70B

highlighted in bold. Macro F1 cores for GPT-3.5 fine-tuned , as well as F1 scores for each category are provided
in Table 7 in the Appendix.
Overall, the human upper bound consistently out-
performs all models. GPT-4 is the closest but still
falls behind by 0.11 to 0.14 and 0.05 to 0.12 points
in fine-grained and high-level tasks respectively for
women and migrants. Llama-3-70B follows, with
gaps of 0.24 to 0.29 and 0.24 to 0.13 points in fine-
grained and high-level tasks, while BERT shows
the largest discrepancies. These results suggest
there is a gap compared to human understanding,
especially in more complex annotation tasks.
Error analysis For the error analysis, we com-
pare the human annotations and zero-shot predic-
tions of GPT-4 for both target groups on the test set,
using the confusion matrices for high-level labels
shown in Fig. 3, as well as for fine-grained level
labels in Fig. 6 provided in the Appendix. We also
consider explanations provided by GPT-4.
Observed errors align with those noted during hu-
man annotation, with solidarity andanti-solidarity
rarely confused (1% of cases). Confusion primar-
ily occurs between (anti-)solidarity subtypes and
none , as well as mixed stance , as the model seems
to look for stronger indications of solidarity despite
instructions to consider even slight expressions of
it (see examples 1 and 2 in Table 9).
There is also notable confusion between the soli-
darity subtypes, with the most frequent confusion
between group-based andcompassionate solidar-
ity, likely because of the presence of multiple cate-
gory characteristics within the texts (see example
3 in Table 9). There is also confusion between
compassionate andempathic solidarity , where the
model sometimes misinterprets empathic as merely
relating to the term empathy , overlooking the full
category definition, which involves respecting di-
versity, as in example 4 in Table 9.
7 Analysis
In this section, we analyze how the solidarity dis-
course in the German parliament developed over
155 years, using automatic, fine-grained annota-tions from the best-performing model, GPT-4 zero-
shot. However, due to cost constraints, we limit the
annotations to a) data concerning migrants, i.e., the
target group for which our models achieved higher
scores and b) a sample of 18,300 instances from
the overall 58k instances concerning migrants. We
draw the sample proportionally for the time spans
in the original data. This selection includes all
records with political party information (see Ap-
pendix B for details on political parties data ex-
traction and list of parties included in the analysis).
The cost of this automatic annotation was around
500 Euro.
How does (anti-)solidarity change over time?
As shown in Fig. 5b, throughout the periods
analyzed, solidarity consistently surpasses anti-
solidarity. From 1880 to 1910, solidarity increased
from under 20% to 30%, driven by discussions
about Eastern and Central European foreign work-
ers’ rights in the context of industrialization and
local demographic shifts (Schönwälder, 1999).
Following the NS regime, solidarity surges
above 50%, aligning with the influx of Vertriebene
(en.: expellees), who were generally viewed pos-
itively in parliamentary debates (Fröhlich, 2023),
as well as the arrival of Gastarbeiter (en.: guest
workers) from the Mediterranean (Stalker, 2000).
The highest solidarity and low anti-solidarity in
1940s reflect limited discussions (due to sparse data
during this period) skewed towards solidarity, pri-
marily focusing on expellees.
Anti-solidarity towards migrants initially rose
from about 5% to over 15% between 1870 and
1890, remaining stable until 1920, likely due to
fears of “Polonization” from the influx of Polish
workers, leading to restrictive policies against per-
ceived threats to German identity (Triadafilopoulos,
2004). From 1960, anti-solidarity resurged with
rising anti-migrant sentiments linked to labor mi-
gration in the 1960s and 1970s, right-wing oppo-
sition to liberal asylum laws in the 1990s (Faist,1900 1950 2000

1994), and the influx of refugees due to the Syrian
war around 2015 with the subsequent rise of the
extreme right-wing AfD party (Hertner, 2022). By
2022, solidarity stabilizes at around 40%, while
anti-solidarity has risen to above 20%. We also
note a relative decrease in solidarity compared to
anti-solidarity, as shown in Fig. 10 in the Appendix,
which illustrates this shift by subtracting the per-
centage of anti-solidarity from that of solidarity.
How have (anti-)solidarity frames evolved over
time? In Fig. 5a, for solidarity (left), it is ev-
ident that group-based solidarity (i.e., emphasis
on shared national identity and integration) was
dominant until the 1990s, peaking to over 50% in
1870 with the founding of the German empire. It
drops to below 20% by 1880, surges back above
50% in 1970, and then declines to below 30% by
2020. These trends align with periods of strong
German nationalism (around 1870 and pre-World
War II) and the influx of expellees in the 1950s
and 1960s. For anti-solidarity (right), trends show
group-based anti-solidarity dominant before WWII,
peaking from 70% to over 90%, then declining to
below 60% post-war, reflecting a decline in op-
position to migration based on national identity
in parliamentary debates after the NS era. Instead,
anti-solidarity arguments shifted to exchange-based
anti-solidarity (from below 10% to above 40% after
World War II), i.e. arguments that migrants are not
providing adequate economic contributions. Nei-
ther compassionate nor empathic anti-solidarity are
frequent at any time. By 2022, group-based soli-
darity declines, giving way to compassionate soli-
darity, which rose to above 40%.
How are solidarity and anti-solidarity frames
represented across political parties? Our anal-ysis covers the distribution of (anti-)solidarity
frames across parties from 1865 to 2022. It should
be noted that we assess the data without regard
to the specific emergence dates of political parties
(e.g., AfD established in 2013 versus SPD in 1863).
Data subdivision by the speaker’s party shows
that all parties, except for the far-right AfD, mainly
exhibit solidarity towards migrants (Fig. 9 in the
Appendix, left). Compassionate and group-based
solidarity are prevalent, with left-leaning parties
(Linke, Grüne) showing higher levels of compas-
sionate and empathic solidarity compared to the
more exchange-focused solidarity of centrist par-
ties (SPD, FDP, CDU/CSU). Conversely, while the
right-wing parties, including CDU/CSU, also en-
gage in anti-solidarity rhetoric, it is AfD that pre-
dominantly holds such stances, focusing mainly
on exchange-based anti-solidarity that suggests mi-
grants contribute less (see Fig. 9 in the Appendix,
right). This distribution mirrors findings in Flan-
ders, Belgium, where radical rightists’ discourse
predominantly focuses on group-based frames;
greens and social democrats emphasize compas-
sionate solidarity, liberals prefer exchange-based
approaches, and both greens and liberals advocate
for empathic solidarity, highlighting a polariza-
tion of partisan discourse (Thijssen and Verheyen,
2022).
8 Concluding remarks
This study set out to i) provide a high-quality
dataset of (anti-)solidarity annotations in German
parliamentary debates, ii) from an NLP perspec-
tive, evaluate the ability of LLMs to assist in large-
scale social and political analyses over extended
periods, and iii) from a CSS perspective, uncover
long-term shifts in solidarity trends in Germany,laying groundwork for future sociological studies.
Concerning i), we invested 1000+ annotation
hours and 18k Euro to provide a data set of 2,864
manually annotated text snippets following the so-
ciological framework of Thijssen (2012).
Regarding ii), our findings indicate that GPT-4
outperforms other models (Llama-3-70B, GPT-3.5
base, fine-tuned, and BERT) in reproducing human
annotations. While other models demonstrate pro-
ficiency in identifying high-level categories, they
exhibit limitations in handling more nuanced cat-
egories, specific to sociological theory. GPT-4,
though challenged by ambiguity, handles complex
tasks even in a zero-shot setting.
Contrary to previous research in CSS that sug-
gested smaller fine-tuned models like BERT per-
formed well (Choi et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023),
our study finds that larger models are more ef-
fective our hard CSS task, possibly due to the
carefully designed prompts based on human ex-
pertise. Our observations align with Ziems et al.
(2024), who noted that while LLMs have not yet
reached the quality of human analysis in classi-
fication tasks within CSS, large instruction-tuned
LLMs are preferable. However, we observe that the
open-source model Llama-3 exhibits inferior per-
formance compared to the non-open-source GPT-4.
In terms of iii), our analysis of German par-
liamentary debates from 1865 to 2022 reveals
shifts in attitudes toward migrants influenced by la-
bor demands, migration waves, and socio-political
changes. The evolution from group-based to com-
passionate solidarity marks a shift towards eco-
nomic pragmatism and issues of redistribution in
migration discourse, likely spurred by rising global
humanitarianism (V ollmer and Karakayali, 2018).
Despite traditional solidarity dominance, the resur-
gence of anti-solidarity since WWII, peaking in
2022, illustrates deepening political polarization.
This underscores the ongoing tension between
xenophobic tendencies and liberal ideals in Ger-
many (Joppke, 2007; Lehr, 2015), reflecting the
complex challenges of integration and multicultur-
alism in a major migrant destination.
These findings lay a strong foundation for further
sociological research using LLMs. Future work
could examine how shifts in political discourse im-
pact policy-making and public opinion, exploring
correlations with civic solidarity. Comparative stud-
ies across countries with varying migration histo-
ries may reveal factors influencing (anti-)solidarity.
Additionally, exploring the effects of such rhetoricon related policies, like migration or equal opportu-
nity, could yield further insights. From an NLP per-
spective, future work can explore a broader range
of LLMs, including those fine-tuned on German
data, and explore the effect of using highlighting
and explanations to improve classification.
Limitations
Our study faces several limitations that should be
considered when interpreting the results.
•The task of annotating political speech, par-
ticularly concepts such as solidarity and anti-
solidarity, poses significant challenges. These
concepts are inherently complex and laden
with subtleties that are difficult to capture,
both for human annotators and automated
models.
•Due to resource constraints, GPT-4 was ap-
plied to only a portion of the dataset, poten-
tially limiting the generalizability of our find-
ings. Moreover, the proportional sampling of
instances across decades might have led to the
underrepresentation of certain periods, which
could have further impacted the comprehen-
siveness of the analysis.
•While our analysis of solidarity and anti-
solidarity frames distribution across parties
covers data from 1865 to 2022 and includes
all historical periods, it does not trace the evo-
lution of partisan discourse over time. We
assess the data comprehensively without fo-
cusing on the specific historical emergence of
political parties (e.g., AfD established in 2013
versus SPD in 1863).
•Additional manual annotation features such as
free-comment explanations, highlighting, and
indications of opposing positions (all avail-
able in our human annotation) were not fully
explored. These elements hold potential for
future studies, which could use them as cues
for LLMs to achieve a more nuanced classifi-
cation.

Appendix
A List of Keywords
ForFrau (en.: woman) we use Frauen, Frau, Mut-
ter, Mädchen, Mütter, Ehefrau, Müttern, Haus-
frauen, Hausfrau, Ehefrauen, Frauenförderung,
Frauenquote, Dienstmädchen, Fräulein, Großmut-
ter, Kriegerfrauen, Arbeiterfrauen, and Trümmer-
frauen.
Since Frau is the German word for woman but
also for Mrs./Ms. , we only include occurrences of
the word Frau that are not followed by a capitalized
word (which are probably surnames).
ForMigrant (en.: refugee) we use Flüchtlinge,
Ausländer, Flüchtlingen, Zuwanderung, Vertriebe-
nen, Ausländern, Asylbewerber, Migranten, Mi-
gration, Heimatvertriebenen, Aussiedler, Einwan-
derung, Ansiedler, Vertriebene, Zuwanderer, Asyl-
bewerbern, Flüchtling, Heimatvertriebene, Sowjet-
zonenflüchtlinge, Aussiedlern, Einwanderer, Asyl-
suchenden, Asylsuchende, Bürgerkriegsflüchtlinge,Zuwanderern, Ansiedlern, Migrantinnen, Ver-
triebener, Emigranten, Kriegsflüchtlinge, Auslän-
derinnen, and Immigranten.
When doing stability tests over the chosen key-
words, we make sure to choose sufficiently many
keywords, i.e., at least 5 (out of 16/32) keywords
and at least 10% of the data, such that enough data
is present to create the plots. For the analysis of
frequency of keywords over time, we calculate the
percentages normalized for each keyword, i.e., a
value of p% in year yimplies that in year y p%
of all sentences with this keyword occurred. The
trends are shown in the Fig. 11 for women and in
Fig. 12 for migrants.
B Parties
We identified political parties by searching for party
names within parentheses, a conventional nota-
tion within parliamentary records to denote the
speaker’s party affiliation, as seen in examples like
"Benjamin Strasser (FDP): Sehr geehrter Präsi-
dent!..." . Following automated extraction, we con-
ducted a manual review to verify the correctness
of the party associations, which resulted in 3,499
out of 58k records with party information spanning
from 1940 to 2022.
List of the parties included in the dataset, along
with the variations of their names or abbrevi-
ations as they have been recorded: AfD (Al-
ternative for Germany); Die Linke (The Left)
with variations such as PDS, Gruppe der PDS;
Bündnis 90/Die Grünen (Alliance 90/The Greens);
CDU/CSU (Christian Democratic Union/Christian
Social Union); SPD (Social Democratic Party of
Germany); FDP (Free Democratic Party); DP
(German Party) with variations such as DP/DPB,
DP/FVP, FVP; GB/BHE (All-German Bloc/League
of Expellees and Deprived of Rights); KPD (Com-
munist Party of Germany); BP (Bavarian Party);
WA V (Economic Reconstruction Union).
C Annotation details
Annotators first identify the specific resources
(such as time, money, rights, or educational ac-
cess) that underlie expressions of solidarity oranti-
solidarity . Following this, they select from a prede-
fined set of indicators tailored to each solidarity or
anti-solidarity category.
We also apply highlighting to indicate parts of
sentences which express solidarity (green) and anti-
solidarity red. In addition, we highlight expres-sions that convey the speaker’s own viewpoint ( self-
position ) and those that address or critique others’
viewpoints ( other-position ). The annotation task
concludes with a free-text commentary, limited to
1-2 sentences, detailing the reasoning behind a cho-
sen category. A detailed example for the annotation
process is available in Fig. 15, which illustrates the
full annotation pipeline with providing explana-
tions for chosen labels.

(1)Compassionate
solidarity towards
women
(June 29, 1961)“Im Zusammenhang mit § 1708 BGB hat das Hohe Haus das 18.
Lebensjahr als Grenze für die Unterhaltspflicht festgelegt. In den
Übergangsvorschriften ist diese Bestimmung für diejenigen, die
am 1. Januar 1962 schon das 16. Lebensjahr vollendet haben,
aufgehoben worden. Diese Regelung erscheint meiner Fraktion
ungerecht, denn dadurch würden beträchtliche Personengruppen
aus dieser Unterhaltspflicht herausgenommen. Gerade die Frauen,
die unter großen Mühen ihre Kinder z. B. auf die höhere Schule
geschickt haben, müßten diese Unkosten ganz allein tragen. ”The speaker is advocating
for extended financial sup-
port for mothers and is em-
phasizing the unfairness of
removing maintenance obli-
gations.
(2)Exchange-based
anti-solidarity
towards migrants
(Apr. 19, 2018)“[...] Lassen Sie mich noch anfügen: Migration ist nicht zwin-
gend erfolgreich – Sie tun immer so, als sei das super –, sie kann
scheitern, und sie scheitert vor allem dann, wenn die Qualifika-
tion der Einwanderer niedrig ist. 2013, also vor der sogenannten
Flüchtlingswelle, hatten 40 Prozent der Zuwanderer aus dem Nicht-
EU-Ausland keinen Abschluss. Seit der Flüchtlingswelle haben
die Messerstechereien um 20 Prozent zugenommen, und wir haben
importierten Antisemitismus im Land. Ist das eine hervorragend
erfolgreiche Migration?”The text criticizes mi-
gration for its negative
economic impacts and the
disproportionate burden
placed by low-skilled
immigrants who take more
resources and social stabil-
ity than they contribute.
(3)Mixed stance
towards migrants
(Feb. 2, 1982)“[...] Wir müssen akzeptieren, daß wir in wenigen Jahren auch
wieder eine höhere Zahl ausländischer Arbeitnehmer in der Bun-
desrepublik brauchen werden, wie Herr Urbaniak vorhin angedeutet
hat.Wir haben also in Wirklichkeit zu einer wirksamen Inte-
gration, die allerdings voraussetzt, [...] daß es in der Frage
des Anwerbestopps und des Verhinderns der illegalen Einwan-
derung keine Ausnahmen geben darf, keine Alternative. . [...]”This text acknowledges the
economic need for foreign
workers and the importance
of their integration, yet si-
multaneously emphasizing
strict controls on illegal im-
migration.
(2)None case
(women)
(June 17, 2015)“[...] ‘Wir wollen freie Menschen sein!’ Es gibt wohl keinen
besseren Satz, um die heutige Debatte hier im Deutschen Bundestag
über den V olksaufstand von 1953 zu eröffnen. [...] Wir erinnern
an Frauen und Männer, die vor 62 Jahren viel Mut bewiesen,
weil sie der Entwicklung ihres Landes und ihrem eigenen Leben
eine andere Richtung geben wollten, weil sie freie Menschen
sein wollten. ”The mention of women is
integrated into the broader
remembrance of the collec-
tive effort of people fighting
against oppression without
emphasizing any specific
women’s issues or needs.

“[...] wenn nachher irgendwelche Schwierigkeiten bei der
Rückzahlung der Darlehne entstehen, man nicht nach der
Strenge des Gesetzes auf dem Schein bestehen und die Rück-
zahlung unter allen Umständen fordern müsse. Ich habe aber
noch eins ganz kurz zu bemerken: die Ausländer sollen
auch mitberücksichtigt werden; nach unsern Beschlüssen
in der Kommission würden die Ausländer in derselben
Weise behandelt werden. Auch da würde man erst fragen:
bist du arm und hilfsbedürftig geworden, dann bekommst du
eine Beihilfe als Geschenk; willst du dich weiter ansiedeln
im Lande, dann bekommst du ein Darlehn. Ich möchte hier
wiederholen: wir haben bei den deutschen Reichsangehöri-
gen, die in andern Ländern geschädigt worden sind durch
Revolution, uns nicht damit begnügt, daß sie eine Unter-
stützung bekommen haben, sondern wir haben erklärt: der
Mann ist geschädigt, und er muß daher eine Entschädigung
für seine Verluste erhalten, wenn er seiner Pflicht strengster
Neutralität genügt hat, und diese Ansprüche haben wir nicht
nur für Hilfsbedürftige erhoben, sondern auch für recht reiche
Leute. [...]”Compassionate solidarity or group-based solidarity towards
migrants
(Apr. 22, 1904)
On the one hand, this text expresses compassionate
solidarity by offering assistance to those in need, such as
financial aid and loans, without requiring reciprocation. On
the other hand, the speaker proposes treating foreigners
and nationals equally in hardship, expressing group-based
solidarity through a unified approach to support.
“Dann bitte ich um genaue Nennung. Ich finde es in der
Tat nicht sonderlich sinnvoll, daß wir amtliche deutsche
Dokumente in einer nichtamtlichen Sprache abfassen. Wenn
das geschehen ist, werden wir gerne darauf hinwirken, daß
das geändert wird. Ich möchte nur darauf aufmerksam
machen, daß aus Ihrer Frage der völlig gegenteilige Sinn
herauszulesen war, nämlich daß Sie offensichtlich wün-
schten, Ausländer, die in Deutschland Examen ablegen,
sollten diese Diplome in ihrer eigenen Sprache ausgefer-
tigt bekommen, was sicherlich nicht unsere Aufgabe sein
kann und auch nicht sehr sinnvoll wäre. [...]”Empathic anti-solidarity , compassionate anti-solidarity or
none towards migrants
(Sept. 26, 1974)
The text suggests empathic anti-solidarity by expect-
ing foreign students to conform to German norms and shows
compassionate anti-solidarity by deeming diplomas in native
languages unnecessary. However, its focus on administrative
details without strong bias classifies it as none.
“Die Zieglerarbeit ist eine schwere, sogar eine sehr schwere;
das wird allgemein anerkannt, auch von allen Gewerbein-
spektoren. Es wird deshalb auch ziemlich häufig für wün-
schenswertst erklärt, daß die Arbeiterinnen aus diesem Pro-
duftionszweige mehr und mehr verdrängt werden. [...]
Wir sind sicherlich der Ansicht, daß die Arbeit auf den
Ziegeleien im allgemeinen für Frauen nicht geeignet ist.
Deshalb können wir uns auch durchaus damit einverstanden
erklären, daß man die Arbeit der Frauen auf den Ziegeleien
erheblich eingeschränkt hat. Wir wünschen, daß man darin
weiter fortfährt, auch selbst dann, wenn dadurch vielle-
icht zunächst ein gewisser Widerstand nicht nur bei den
Unternehmern, sondern auch sogar bet den Arbeitern sel-
ber erzeugt werden wird. Denn darüber sind die Berichte
ziemlich einig, daß, wenn die Frauenarbeit nicht erheblich
eingeschränkt würde, dann die Frauen gesundheitliche und
sittliche Schädigungen davontragen.”Empathic anti-solidarity or mixed stance towards women
(Jan. 13, 1897)
The text can be classified as empathic anti-solidarity
by suggesting that women be excluded from brickmaking,
which supports traditional roles that limit their opportunities.
It also presents a mixed stance by recognizing the job’s
difficulty and proposing to restrict women’s employment for
their protection, which can be viewed as conditional support
and simultaneously – an imposed restriction.
“Wir wünschen das nicht im Interesse der Frauen, wir haben
uns mit den Frauenrechtlerinnen noch niemals auf eine Stufe
gestellt. Wir wünschen das nicht im Namen der Frauen
und tm Interesse der Frauen, sondern im Gesamtinter-
esse des deutschen Volkes, weil wir der Meinung sind,
daß bei Mitwirkung der Frauen mehr Verständnis für die
Angeklagten und ein sozialerer Geist sich in der Recht-
sprechung durchsetzen wird. Deshalb bitten wir Sie, bei
den Beschlüssen zweiter Lesung zu bleiben. [...]”Group-based solidarity or exchange-based solidarity
towards women
(March 8, 1921)
This text shows group-based solidarity by promoting
women’s participation in the judiciary to improve legal
proceedings for societal benefit. It can also be interpreted
as exchange-based solidarity, as it highlights the reciprocal
advantages of women’s inclusion.

(Sept. 14, 1989)“[...] Dr. Hirsch: Herr Minister Möllemann, es ist
doch wohl so, daß es sich nicht um das Geld des
Bundes oder um das Geld eines Landes handelt, son-
dern immer um das Geld des Steuerzahlers und daß
dementsprechend verlangt werden kann, daß Bund
und Länder gemeinsam das tun, was im Interesse
der Bevölkerung, zu der dann ja auch die Aussiedler
gehören, notwendig und richtig ist. [...]”“[...] Dr. Hirsch: Mr. Minister Mölle-
mann, it is indeed the case that it is not
about the federal government’s money or
a state’s money, but always about the tax-
payer’s money, and accordingly, it can
be demanded that the federal and state
governments together do what is neces-
sary and right in the interest of the pop-
ulation, which then also includes the ex-
pellees . [...]”
Model’s
Explanation[...] The appropriate high-level category for this text is NONE, as it neither promotes support
nor opposition towards migrants but rather discusses financial governance regarding a subset
of migrants without an emotional or ideological angle.
(2)Gold standard:
exchange-based

towards migrants
Predicted label:

(May 26, 1869)“[...] Ich glaube wohl nicht näher aus die materiellen
Unzuträglichkeiten eingehen zu sollen, die damit ver-
bunden sind, wenn man die Gegenseitigkeit in der
Gesetzgebung dem Ausländer gegenüber streng aus-
recht erhält. Es liegt ja doch wirklich im Interesse der
Staaten des Norddeutschen Bundes, daß man diejenigen
Ausländer, die uns etwas Gutes bringen können, zum
Gewerbebetrieb zuläßt und uns nicht selbst damit straft,
daß man die Gewerbetreibenden nicht zuläßt, in deren
Heimath vielleicht noch sehr schlechte Gewerbegesetze
existiren. [...]”“[...] I believe I should not delve into the
material inconveniences associated with
maintaining strict reciprocity in legisla-
tion towards foreigners. It is indeed in
the interest of the states of the North Ger-
man Confederation to allow those foreign-
ers who can bring us benefits to engage in
business, and not to punish ourselves by
denying business people who may come
from countries with very poor trade laws.
[...]”
Model’s
Explanation[...] This could be interpreted as exchange-based solidarity to some extent. However, the core
of the discussion is legal and pragmatic, rather than being based on an ethos of solidarity
or anti-solidarity as defined. [...] It is important to note that without the broader context of
the discussion or the surrounding text, it is difficult to ascertain the overall stance regarding
migrants beyond this specific legislative detail.

(March 13, 2003)“[...] Wir werden es nicht zulassen, dass künftig aus-
ländische Ehefrauen vier Jahre in unzumutbaren
Ehen verharren, um nicht aus Deutschland aus-
gewiesen zu werden. Das werden Sie nicht erreichen.
Ich will es überhaupt nicht verhehlen: Wir haben noch
unendlich viel zu tun, bevor wir gerade im Erwerb-
sleben und bei der traditionellen Rollen- und Aufgaben-
verteilung eine faktische Gleichstellung von Frauen und
Männern erreicht haben. [...]”“[...] We will not allow foreign wives to
remain in unbearable marriages for four
years to avoid being deported from Ger-
many . You will not achieve this. I do not
want to conceal it at all: we still have an
immense amount of work to do before we
achieve actual equality between women and
men in the workforce and in the traditional
distribution of roles and tasks. We take this
responsibility seriously. [...]”
Model’s
Explanation[...] The most fitting subtype of solidarity in this context is GROUP-BASED SOLIDARITY
because the text discusses the collective responsibility to promote equality and the shared
efforts needed to achieve substantial change in societal structures concerning the roles and
treatment of women.

(Apr. 5, 1922)“[...] Wenn man von den Leuten fordert, daß sie

soll man diese Ausländer auch wissen lassen, nach
welchen Vorschriften sie sich zu richten haben. Es ist
schikanös und heimtückisch, die Leute mit solchen
Vorschriften zu überfallen. Wie das in der Praxis vor
sich geht, brauche ich Ihnen nicht lange zu schildern.
[...]”“[...] When people are required to regis-
ter, and all kinds of restrictions on their
stay are imposed, these foreigners should
also be informed about the regulations
they must follow. It is harassing and treach-
erous to ambush people with such regula-
tions. I do not need to describe to you at
length how this happens in practice. [...]”
Model’s
Explanation[...] The text seems to transmit a sense of EMPATHIC SOLIDARITY because it addresses the
unfairness and challenges that foreigners face and advocates for fairness and clear guidelines,
which shows a degree of empathy for their situation.

ste Kontrolle der Ausländer. Bei dieser Gelegenheit
möchte ich an die Retchsregierung die Frage richten, ob
es richtig ist, daß vom Auswärtigen Amt zehn Russen
das Recht erhalten haben, Einreiseerlaubnisscheine
nach Deutschland auszustellen. Wir verlangen schärf-
ste Kontrolle der Ausländer. Nach dem, was ich aber
eben mitgeteilt habe, würde natürlich eine Kontrolle
illusorisch sein.”“[...] We also demand the strictest control
of foreigners. . On this occasion, I would
like to ask the Reich government whether it
is true that the Foreign Office has granted
ten Russians the right to issue entry per-
mit certificates to Germany. We demand
the strictest control of foreigners. However,
based on what I have just reported, such
control would naturally be illusory.”
Model’s
Explanation[...] Given the nature of the concerns highlighted, which are about resource distribution
(control and monitoring), the sentiment somewhat aligns with an exchange-based view but
from a critical angle, focusing on preventing perceived negative impacts rather than fostering
an exchange. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be EXCHANGE-BASED
ANTI-SOLIDARITY.

(May 14, 1982)“[...] Der Flughafen Frankfurt ist Einfallstor für Asylbe-
werber. Das Land Hessen ist daher von dem Zustrom
der Asylbewerber besonders betroffen. Obgleich die
Zahl der Asylbewerber seit 1980 rückläufig ist, hat
Hessen immer noch einen Überhang von 1 500 Asylbe-
werbern. Im Jahr 1981 hat das Land allein auf Grund
seines Aufnahmegesetzes 22,4 Millionen DM für die
Asylbewerber aufzubringen gehabt.”“[...] Frankfurt Airport is a gateway for asy-
lum seekers. Therefore, the state of Hesse
is particularly affected by the influx of
asylum seekers. Although the number of
asylum seekers has been declining since
1980, Hesse still has a surplus of 1,500 asy-
lum seekers. In the year 1981, the state had
to raise 22.4 million DM for asylum seekers
alone, based on its reception law.”
Model’s
Explanation[...] the text does not display solidarity with or anti-solidarity against asylum seekers in the
context of promoter solidarity or anti-solidarity subtypes as defined. It seems to be merely
stating the situation as a matter of fact without expressing a clear stance towards the asylum
seekers.

das Fristenmodell sei einfach und klar. Einfach und
klar für die Frau, aber auch einfach und klar für das

Die von uns vorgeschlagene Lösung unterscheidet sich
vom Fristenmodell prinzipiell dadurch, daß wir sagen:
Erstens. In einer Konfliktsituation zwischen Frau und
ungeborenem Kind kann nicht die Frau allein über das
ungeborene Leben verfügen. Wir legen diese Entschei-
dung in die Hände von Ärzten.”“[...] Just now, colleague Funcke said that
the deadline model is simple and clear. Sim-
ple and clear for the woman, but also
simple and clear for the unborn life: it
is simply and clearly killed. The solution
we propose differs fundamentally from the
deadline model in that we say: First. In
a conflict situation between a woman and
an unborn child, the woman alone cannot
decide over the unborn life. We place this
decision in the hands of doctors.”
Model’s
Explanation[...] Given the text’s focus on an ethical debate that does not inherently align with either
supporting or opposing women’s societal standing or collective rights, the most fitting classifi-
cation appears to be NONE.

tion in full-time employment in this country
comes into effect. [...] But in this case, too,
Mrs. von der Leyen: not talk, but act.
[...]”
Model’s
Explanation[...] The text is critical of a policy deemed detrimental to promoting women’s full participation
in the workforce and calls for action rather than mere discussion. The critique is embedded
within an appeal to recognize the importance of women’s employment in addressing broader
societal and economic challenges. [...]

GROUP-BASED 
SOLIDARITY: 
Is 
coded 
when 
solidarity 
is 
based 
on 
the 
idea 
of 
unity 
and 
support 
among 
members 
of 
a

driven 
by 
shared 
characteristics,

COMPASSIONATE 
SOLIDARITY: 
Emphasizes

marginalized, 
disadvantaged, 
or 
vulnerable 
groups, 
focusing 
on 
aid 
without 
expecting 
anything 
in

It 
involves 
recognizing 
vulnerabilities, 
advocating 
for 
assistance 
to 
alleviate 
hardships, 
and 
offering 
support 
purely 
based 
on 
need. 
While 
not 
all 
indicators 
must 
be 
present, 
the 
core 
of 
compassionate 
solidarity 
lies 
in 
acknowledging 
and 
addressing 
the 
needs 
of 
those 
in 
vulnerable 
positions. 
The 
support 
is 
aimed 
at

EMPATHIC 
ANTI-SOLIDARITY: 
Refers 
to 
the 
cases 
when 
a 
speaker 
refers 
to 
a 
group 
indicating 
that 
this 
group 
is 
different 
from 
everyone 
else, 
but 
this 
difference 
should 
not 
be 
respected 
or 
recognised. 
This 
can 
be 
expressed 
in: 
an 
overt 
or 
covert 
refusal 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
validity 
of 
a 
group's 
diverse 
identities, 
roles, 
and 
choices. 
Opposition 
to 
the 
group's 
efforts 
to 
define 
their 
identity, 
roles, 
and 
aspirations 
on 
their 
own 
terms. 
Promotion 
of 
a 
return 
to

maintenance 
of 
traditional 
societal 
roles 
and 
structures 
that 
restrict 
the 
group's

EXCHANGE-BASED 
ANTI-SOLIDARITY: 
Focuses 
on 
the 
idea 
that 
some 
groups 
take 
more 
than 
they 
give. 
It 
brings 
attention 
to 
groups 
that 
seem 
to 
receive 
a 
lot 
of 
resources 
or 
support, 
but 
do 
not 
contribute 
much 
or 
cause 
problems. 
This 
perspective 
supports 
punishing 
such 
groups, 
giving 
them 
less 
help, 
or 
making 
them 
contribute 
more. 
This 
can 
be 
expressed 
in 
suggesting 
that 
this 
group 
should 
be 
punished, 
or 
get 
less 
than 
they 
are 
currently 
getting; 
calling 
for 
the 
group 
to 
give 
or 
do 
more 
in 
return 
for 
help. 
Remember: 
exchange-based 
criticisms 
focus 
on 
the 
economic 
implications 
and 
perceived 
unfairness 
in 
resource 
distribution 
(difference 
from 
compassionate 
anti-solidarity).
 
-
GROUP-BASED 
ANTI-SOLIDARITY: 
Points 
to 
an 
out-group 
characterised 
by 
pronounced 
differences, 
and 
an 
expression 
of 
exclusion. 
This 
can 
be 
expressed 
in: 
a 
stronger 
emphasis 
on 
one's 
own 
group's 
interests 
(e.g., 
We 
must 
stand 
up 
for 
our 
own 
interests...); 
resistance 
to 
support 
of, 
assimilation 
or 
integration 
with 
other 
groups. 
With 
migrants, 
this 
can 
be 
expressed 
as 
an 
emphasis 
on 
protecting 
interests 
of 
the 
native 
population 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
including 
migrants; 
portrayal 
of 
migrants 
as 
fundamentally 
different 
and 
unable 
to 
integrate, 
thus 
excluding 
them; 
a 
call 
for 
migrants 
to 
conform 
to 
existing 
norms 
without 
offering 
them 
full 
participation 
in 
society.

COMPASSIONATE 
ANTI-SOLIDARITY: 
It 
is 
about 
disregarding 
and 
excluding 
individuals 
or 
subgroups, 
refusing 
to 
support 
them 
either 
on 
the 
basis 
that 
they 
are 
perceived 
to 
be 
in 
a 
good 
position 
already, 
or 
are 
viewed 
as 
undeserving 
of 
help. 
When 
applied 
to 
migrants, 
this 
can 
be 
expressed 
by 
(but 
not 
limited 
with): 
denial 
of 
systemic 
issues 
(protections 
or 
affirmative 
actions 
are 
unnecessary 
or 
overreaching); 
security 
concerns, 
skepticism 
about 
the 
motives 
and 
legitimacy 
of 
asylum 
seekers. 
Remember, 
compassionate 
criticisms 
might 
question 
the 
necessity 
of 
certain 
protections

SOLIDARITY: 
Involves 
expressions 
that 
promote 
understanding, 
support, 
and 
unity 
with 
different 
groups 
or 
individuals 
(women 
in 
our

often 
emphasizing 
shared

compassion, 
mutual

that 
show 
opposition, 
disregard, 
or 
exclusion 
towards 
certain 
groups

individuals 
(women 
in

This 
includes 
emphasizing

MIXED: 
A 
mixed 
stance 
toward 
women 
is 
characterized 
by 
the 
presence 
of 
both 
supportive 
and 
opposing 
expressions 
within 
the 
same 
text. 
This 
stance 
emerges 
in 
discussions 
where 
acknowledgment 
of 
women's 
rights, 
contributions, 
or 
needs 
is 
juxtaposed 
with 
limitations, 
conditions, 
or 
reservations 
that 
counteract 
or 
diminish 
the 
initial 
support. 
Key 
features 
of 
a 
mixed 
stance 
include: 
acknowledgment 
followed 
by 
restriction; 
conditional 
support 
which 
is 
predicated 
on 
certain 
traditional 
or 
societal 
expectations; 
statements 
of 
recognition 
of 
women's 
contributions 
or 
rights 
followed 
by 
contradicting 
actions 
or 
policies.
-
NONE: 
Texts 
that 
neither 
express 
solidarity 
nor 
anti-solidarity 
with 
women, 
reflecting 
a 
neutral 
position 
or 
absence 
of 
any 
specific 
stance 
towards 
women's 
issues. 
Remember, 
discussions 
that 
touch 
upon 
women's 
familial 
roles 
(e.g., 
as 
mothers, 
wives, 
or 
daughters) 
and 
their 
societal 
implications 
are 
relevant 
and 
should 
be 
analysed 
for 
expressions 
of 
solidarity 
or 
anti-solidarity. 
The 
absence 
of 
overt 
support 
or 
opposition 
doesn't 
automatically 
lead 
to 
a 
NONE 
classification; 
subtle

may 
still 
align 
with

undeserving 
of 
help. 
In 
applying 
compassionate 
anti-solidarity 
to 
women, 
this 
can 
be 
expressed 
by 
(but 
not 
limited 
with): 
denial 
of 
systemic 
issues 
(protections 
are 
unnecessary 
or 
overreaching); 
refusal 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
specific 
needs 
or 
challenges 
faced 
by 
women; 
emphasizing 
women's 
choice 
in 
scenarios 
where 
systemic 
barriers 
limit 
those 
choices; 
discourse 
shifts 
focus 
from 
societal 
or 
structural 
solutions 
to 
individual 
responsibility; 
reinforcing 
stereotypes 
or 
generalizations 
about 
women.

the 
text 
to 
identify 
its 
high-level 
category 
related 
to 
women: 
SOLIDARITY, 
ANTI-SOLIDARITY, 
MIXED, 
or 
NONE. 
If 
the 
text 
falls 
under 
SOLIDARITY 
or 
ANTI-SOLIDARITY, 
further 
specify 
by 
identifying 
the 
most 
appropriate 
subtype: 
EMPATHIC, 
EXCHANGE-BASED, 
GROUP-BASED, 
or 
COMPASSIONATE. 
After 
your 
comprehensive 
analysis, 
conclude 
with 
'Label:' 
followed 
by 
the 
most 
fitting 
category 
name. 
If 
identifying 
a 
subtype, 
combine 
it 
with 
the

GROUP-BASED 
SOLIDARITY, 
EXCHANGE-BASED 
SOLIDARITY, 
EMPATHIC 
SOLIDARITY, 
COMPASSIONATE 
SOLIDARITY, 
GROUP-BASED 
ANTI-SOLIDARITY,
