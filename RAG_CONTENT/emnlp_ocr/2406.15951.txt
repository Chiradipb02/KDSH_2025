Abstract
While existing alignment paradigms have been
integral in developing large language models
(LLMs), LLMs often learn an averaged hu-
man preference and struggle to model diverse
preferences across cultures, demographics, and
communities. We propose MODULAR PLU-
RALISM , a modular framework based on multi-
LLM collaboration for pluralistic alignment:
it ‚Äúplugs into‚Äù a base LLM a pool of smaller
but specialized community LMs , where mod-
els collaborate in distinct modes to flexibility
support three modes of pluralism: Overton,
steerable, and distributional (Sorensen et al.,
2024b). MODULAR PLURALISM is uniquely
compatible with black-box LLMs and offers
the modular control of adding new commu-
nity LMs for previously underrepresented com-
munities. We evaluate MODULAR PLURAL -
ISM with six tasks and four datasets featur-
ing questions/instructions with value-laden and
perspective-informed responses. Extensive ex-
periments demonstrate that MODULAR PLU-
RALISM advances the three pluralism objec-
tives across six black-box and open-source
LLMs. Further analysis reveals that LLMs are
generally faithful to the inputs from smaller
community LLMs, allowing seamless patching
by adding a new community LM to better cover
previously underrepresented communities.1
1 Introduction
Alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims
to adapt models to reflect human values, inten-
tions, and preferences (Leike et al., 2018; Gabriel,
2020). However, human preferences are not a
monolith: norms, values, and priorities vary greatly
informed by community, culture, demographics,
ideology, and more (Eckert and McConnell-Ginet,
2013; Keeney and Keeney, 2009; Bai et al., 2022;
Casper et al., 2023; Sorensen et al., 2024a). The
1Code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/BunsenFeng/modular_pluralism.increasing ubiquity of LLMs necessitates them to
model and reflect pluralistic human values (e.g.,
pluralistic alignment (Sorensen et al., 2024b)), but
existing alignment procedures might actually harm
pluralism according to empirical and theoretical
studies (Santurkar et al., 2023; Durmus et al.,
2023; Chakraborty et al., 2024; Sorensen et al.,
2024b). Improvements in data composition (Kirk
et al., 2024), alignment objective (Chakraborty
et al., 2024), and modeling frameworks (Jang et al.,
2023) might produce more pluralistic models by re-
training or re-aligning LLMs. Nevertheless, some
of the most popular LLM services with the broadest
set of users are proprietary and feature black-box
LLMs (Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023),
whereas existing methods are not directly appli-
cable in black-box settings. In addition, when
one community, culture, or perspective is found to
be underrepresented after training/alignment com-
pleted, retraining or adapting LLMs to patch those
representation gaps is very expensive.
To this end, we propose MODULAR PLURAL -
ISM, a plug-and-play pluralistic alignment frame-
work with multi-LLM collaboration (Feng et al.,
2024). In MODULAR PLURALISM , an LLM that
only needs black-box access collaborates with a
pool of specialized community LMs , incorporating
values and perspectives across diverse communi-
ties through token-level interactions. Concretely,
we first train community LMs‚Äîlanguage models
specialized to represent a certain community‚Äîby
finetuning existing LM checkpoints on community-
specific corpora. Depending on the type of plural-
ism (adopted from Sorensen et al., 2024b), MOD-
ULAR PLURALISM features three modes of multi-
LLM collaboration (Figure 1): (1) Overton plural-
ism, where LLMs should provide a range of rea-

diverse comments and the black-box LLM sum-
marizes these arguments into a coherent response.
(2)Steerable pluralism, where LLMs should faith-
fully steer towards a user-specified attribute to per-
sonalize the output. In this setting, the black-box
LLM selects a comment from community LMs that
best reflects the attribute, and generates a response
conditioned on the selected comment. (3) Distri-
butional pluralism, where LLMs‚Äô distribution over
answers should reflect population-level distribu-
tions. In this setting, the black-box LLM produces
token probability distributions separately condi-
tioned on each comment from community LMs,
and then community-specific distributions are ag-
gregated according to population priors. Depend-
ing on the usage context, the above three modes of
multi-LLM collaboration could be selectively em-
ployed to serve different pluralism purposes. In this
way, MODULAR PLURALISM presents a modular
approach to patch the representation gaps of LLMs:
when certain values, cultures, and communities are
underrepresented, a new community LM could be
added to the system for equitable alignment.
We evaluate MODULAR PLURALISM with six
open-source and proprietary LLMs of varying sizes
on four datasets and six tasks spanning the three
types of pluralism. We compare MODULAR PLU-
RALISM against vanilla LLMs, existing alignment
procedures, prompting for pluralism, and a mixture-of-experts method (Masoudnia and Ebrahimpour,
2014). Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MODULAR PLURALISM improves the coverage
of diverse values for overton pluralism by 68.5%
on average, offers greater steerablility towards val-
ues and demographic attributes when generating
responses in 26.6% and 10.4% of cases, and better
reflects the distributional nature of moral scenarios
and global perspectives by at least 10.9%. Further
analysis reveals that MODULAR PLURALISM en-
ables patching underrepresented communities by
plugging in a new community LM and could be
extended to model cultural pluralism in addition to
opinions and perspectives. We will make all code
and data publicly available upon publication.
2 Methodology
Modular Framework InMODULAR PLURAL -
ISM, we aim to enable the collaboration between
LLMs with black-box access and a pool of smaller
but specialized community models for pluralis-
tic alignment (Figure 1). Concretely, we assume
access to an LLM ‚Äôs output and token probabil-
ities and train a pool of community LMs C=
{c1,c2,¬∑¬∑¬∑,ck}, each finetuned on a community
corpora Difrom an existing model checkpoint
c, formally ci= NLL( c| Di). These corpora
{Di}aim to represent diverse demographics, cul-
tures, and socio-political backgrounds, collectedfrom news, social media, and more (Jiang et al.,
2022; Feng et al., 2023). Given a user query
q, instead of solely relying on LLM , the smaller
community LMs generate messages/comments first
mi=ci(q)and employed by the LLM for refer-
ence. Depending on the type of pluralism objective
(Sorensen et al., 2024b), MODULAR PLURALISM
features three modes of decoding-time collabora-
tion (Liu et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2024).
Overton Pluralism Overton pluralistic models
should reflect diverse values and perspectives in
response to user queries. To this end, all smaller
community LMs are employed to generate com-
ments {m1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,mk}. These comments are then
concatenated together along with the query q,
where the LLM serves as a multi-document sum-
marization system to synthesize diverse viewpoints
into a coherent response: response = LLM( q|
{m1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,mk}). Specifically, we employ the
prompt ‚ÄúPlease comment on a given situation with
the help of the following passages. ‚Äù for the LLM
to encourage faithful representation of diverse per-
spectives from community LMs.
Steerable Pluralism Steerable pluralistic mod-
els should be able to faithfully steer towards cer-
tain values/attributes when requested to in the user
query, respecting the agency of diverse LLM user
populations. The role of the LLM in this case
is to select a community LM that best reflects
the priorities of the given attribute. Concretely,
given the diverse messages from community LMs
{m1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,mk}about the query q, the LLM se-
lect one message based on the attribute a‚àà A :
m= select( {m1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,mk} |LLM,q, a). We
use the prompt ‚ÄúWhich of the following comments
best reflect <attribute>?‚Äù for the selection. We
expect LLMs to pick different community LM
messages based on different attributes in Aand
generate a response conditioned on that message:
response = LLM( q|m, a).
Distributional Pluralism Distributional plural-
istic models should produce response distributions
that correlate with the real-world distribution of
human populations. To this end the LLM gen-
erates multiple answer probability distributions
{d1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,dk}separately conditioned on each com-
munity LM messages: di= LLM( q|mi). These
community-specific distributions are then aggre-
gated: d=Pk
i=1widi, where wirepresents com-
munity priors (e.g., the proportion of registeredDemocrats, Republicans, and independents in the
United States) and sums up to 1. In this way, the
LLM produces diverse distributions conditioned on
each community LM and are jointly considered to
reflect real-world populations.
3 Experimental Settings
Models We employ six open and propri-
etary LLMs for model‚Äôs pluralism evaluation:
LLAMA2-13B (Touvron et al., 2023), CHATGPT
(Achiam et al., 2023), LLAMA2-7B ,LLAMA2-
70B,LLAMA3-8B , and GEMMA -7B(Team et al.,
2024). We mainly focus on LLAMA2-13B and
CHATGPT in the main paper to cover large and
small, black-box and open LLMs: we present re-
sults for other models in Appendix A. For each
LLM, we employ both unaligned base models and
their aligned versions.
Implementation We employ Mistral-7B-
Instruct-v0.2 (Jiang et al., 2023) as the initial
checkpoint for community LMs and further
finetune them on community-specific corpora with
LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) parameter-efficient training.
By default, we employ the six perspective-laden
corpora in Feng et al. (2023) as community adap-
tation targets, featuring left/center/right-learning
news and social media documents, while we
further explore other community LM settings in
Section 5. This results in six community LMs
tailored towards different perspectives to be
employed in collaboration with the LLMs.
Baselines We compare MODULAR PLURALISM
with three baselines on various LLMs: 1) vanilla ,
where the LLM is directly employed for prompt-
ing; 2) prompting , where we induce pluralism
through prompting by prepending instructions such
as‚ÄúMake sure your response reflects diverse values
and perspectives. ‚Äù ; 3)mixture-of-experts (MoE),
where user queries are routed to the most fitting
community LM. The selected community LM then
generates comments to the user query, which are
prepended to the query and provided to the LLM
for response generation.
Tasks and Datasets We employ six tasks with
four datasets in English to evaluate the three modes
of pluralistic alignment.
1.Overton w/ NLI evaluation. We employ the
Value Kaleidoscope (VK) dataset (Sorensen
et al., 2024a), a repository of situations (e.g.,
taking down 4chan) and associated values,MethodLLAMA2-13B CHATGPT

to evaluate how well LLMs could generate
responses that cover diverse values and per-
spectives. We specifically employ an NLI
model (Schuster et al., 2021) to evaluate what
percentage of values identified in VK are re-
flected in LLM responses.
2.Overton w/ human and GPT-4 evaluation. In
addition to NLI models, we employ human
evaluation and GPT-4 LLM-as-a-judge eval-
uation (Zheng et al., 2024). We compare
LLM responses from MODULAR PLURAL -
ISMagainst baselines. For human evaluation,
annotators choose the response that better re-
flects pluralistic values and perspectives. A
similar evaluation is conducted with GPT-4
as a judge. We present the results from both
evaluations as win, tie, and lose rates of our
approach against the three baselines.
3.Steerable w/ Value Kaleidoscope. LLMs are
tasked with steering towards the specified
value and reason about its relationship with
the situation, i.e., a three-way classification of
support ,oppose , oreither over (value, situa-
tion) pairs, or binary without the either exam-
ples, where ground truths are provided by VK.
We employ Accuracy (Acc), Balanced Accu-
racy (BAcc), and Macro-averaged F1-score
(MaF) as evaluation metrics.
4.Steerable w/ OpinionQA. OpinionQA (San-
turkar et al., 2023) is a dataset of US-
based survey responses with socio-political
attributes (e.g., education and party affilia-
tion). LLMs are tasked with steering towards
the specified demographic attribute when re-

accuracy to quantify this match.
5.Distributional w/ MoralChoice. MoralChoice
(Scherrer et al., 2024) is a morality reason-
ing dataset with low-ambiguity and high-
ambiguity scenarios, each associated with 2
potential actions. LLMs are tasked with rea-
soning over which action might be more desir-
able, while its token probabilities for choos-
ing the two actions should reflect consensus
([1,0]) for low-ambiguity scenarios and uncer-
tainty ( [0.5,0.5]) for high-ambiguity scenar-
ios. We use the Jensen‚ÄìShannon distance to
measure the distributional differences.Against

and record LLMs‚Äô distributions over the
options. We then compare them with the

4 Results
MODULAR PLURALISM better covers diverse
values and perspectives. We present the results
foroverton w/ NLI evaluation in Figure 2. MODU-
LAR PLURALISM achieves the highest coverage of
values on both LLMs, with an improvement of up
to 50.3%. Prompting for pluralism does not result
in stable improvements: we find that prompting-
based approaches often produce a rigid and tem-
plated response ( ‚ÄúOn one hand, . . . on the other,
. . . therefore . . . ‚Äù ). In contrast, MODULAR PLU-
RALISM produces a natural and coherent summa-
rization of varying perspectives from community
LMs and the LLM itself (Appendix A). We ad-
ditionally observe that our approach works better
with aligned LLMs than unaligned ones, especially
for ChatGPT with an improvement of 27.2%. This
is attributable to the role of LLMs in MODULAR
PLURALISM : they act as multi-document summa-
rization systems to synthesize diverse comments
from community LMs into a coherent response,while aligned LLMs are better at instruction fol-
lowing at carrying out these tasks. Nevertheless,
our approach also significantly improves unaligned
base LLMs.
Human and GPT-4 evaluation find that MOD-
ULAR PLURALISM produces more pluralistic
responses. We present the results for overton w/
human and GPT-4 evaluation in Figure 3. We find
thatMODULAR PLURALISM consistently achieves
higher win rate against all three baselines and two
evaluation settings. The five human annotators
have a Fleiss‚Äô Kappa of 0.4678, indicating moder-
ate and reasonable agreement. Among the three
baselines, prompting offers a more competitive ap-
proach in both evaluation settings, while MOD-
ULAR PLURALISM ‚Äôs win rate is still 45.8% and
16.5% higher in human and GPT-4 evaluation. To-
gether with the NLI evaluation, MODULAR PLU-
RALISM is consistently established as more overton
pluralistic and could produce better well-rounded
responses that cover diverse sides of the problem.
MODULAR PLURALISM offers stronger steer-
ability for value-specific contexts. We present
the results for Steerable w/ Value Kaleidoscope in
Table 1. We find that in both binary and three-
way classification settings, MODULAR PLURAL -
ISM could better prioritize specified values, im-
proving over baselines by up to 23.8% and 21.8%
on balanced accuracy and Macro-F1 scores in the
three-way classification setting. The ‚Äúeither‚Äù op-
tion in the three-way settings adds more ambigu-
ity than the binary setting so we also present the
binary setting of ‚Äúsupport‚Äù and ‚Äúoppose‚Äù: MOD-
ULAR PLURALISM also outperforms baselines by
15.1% on average in this more clear-cut setting.
MODULAR PLURALISM are more faithful
to personas of socio-political attributes. We
present the results for Steerable w/ OpinionQA in
Table 2. MODULAR PLURALISM works best with
aligned LLMs, with an average improvement of
8.9% over the strongest baseline in overall accu-
racy. When dissecting into the eight socio-political
categories, we find that MODULAR PLURALISM re-
sulted in the strongest improvement (12.8%) for po-
litical party attributes, compared to the average im-
provement (8.9%). Together with the fact that the
default community LMs are exactly based on politi-
cally motivated communities and corpora (¬ß3), this
highlights the potential that additional community
LMs could be added to MODULAR PLURALISMMethodLLAMA2-13B CHATGPT

MODULAR PLURALISM strikes a balance be-
tween low and high ambiguity moral scenarios.
We present the performance of Distributional w/
MoralChoice in Figure 4. We observe that un-
aligned and aligned LLMs often show distinctly dif-
ferent patterns in low and high-ambiguity scenarios:
aligned LLMs have lower entropy in token proba-
bility distributions (Santurkar et al., 2023; Sorensen
et al., 2024b) and are thus highly ‚Äúcertain‚Äù in low-
ambiguity cases, but this over-confidence also re-
sults in greater distributional distances in high-
ambiguity scenarios; the direct opposite applies
to unaligned LLMs, which is especially salient for
the heavily-aligned ChatGPT. By employing MOD-ULAR PLURALISM , both unaligned and aligned
LLMs move to the center of the two extremes ev-
ident in the lowest overall distance (16.1% lower
than the strongest baseline on average), benefitting
from the unanimous/conflicting comments from
the pool of community LMs.
MODULAR PLURALISM better models nation-
ality distributions. We present the performance
ofDistributional w/ GlobalOpinionQA in Table

dia corpora through community LMs, MODULAR
PLURALISM is consistently better aligned with var-
ious countries‚Äô distributions with an average 14.9%
reduction in J-S distance. Unaligned LLMs work
better than aligned ones by 11.5% on average, at-
tributable to the combination of increased entropy
and misalignment in existing alignment proceduresMethodLLAMA2-13B CHATGPT

(Sorensen et al., 2024b). Dissecting the perfor-
mance into seven specific nations around the world,
we see that MODULAR PLURALISM ‚Äôs performance
gains are largest for the United States (25.8%) and
the smallest for Nigeria (9.3%). Together with the
fact that our default community LMs are based on
US news media and subreddits with mainly US and
West-centric content, this finding motivates other
community LM settings that better reflect the cul-
tures and issues beyond the Western world: we
further explore this in Section 5.
5 Analysis
Message Faithfulness MODULAR PLURALISM
relies on an important premise that LLMs would
faithfully leverage the generated comments from
smaller community LMs to generate responses,
while it is possible that the community LMs‚Äô cul-
tures and viewpoints are different from the LLMs‚Äô
and results in knowledge conflicts (Xie et al., 2023;
Wang et al., 2023a). To this end, we employ NLI
models to evaluate how well do LLMs cover/reflect
the comments of community LMs. Concretely, weevaluate the entailment from community LM com-
ments to each sentence in LLMs‚Äô final response
and investigate 1) whether one community LM‚Äôs
comments could entail at least sentence in the fi-
nal response (i.e., the comment is reflected some-
where in the response) and 2) whether there are
sentences in the final response that could not be
entailed by any community LM comments (i.e.,
the LLM generated new content in addition to what
community LMs provided). We present the percent-
age of these scenarios in Figure 5, which shows
that comments from diverse community LMs‚Äô are
moderately covered with an average coverage rate
of 51.2%. Among the six default perspective-
informed community LMs, the ones based on social
media (Reddit) are generally better covered than
news media, with an average coverage of 57.7%
and 44.7%: we hypothesize that this is because val-
ues and perspectives from social media might be
more unique and unconventional. There is also no
significant bias against left/center/right-leaning per-
spectives, with LLAMA3-8B being the only model
slightly biased against right-leaning communityCommunityLLAMA2-13B CHATGPT

LMs (but not statistically significant). In addition,
an average of 33.8% sentences also feature content
not provided by community LMs and added by the
LLM itself, with the stronger LLMs ( LLAMA3-
8BandCHATGPT ) featuring both higher commu-
nity LM coverage rate and new content rate. This
indicates that stronger LLMs could better strike a
balance between multi-document summarization
and adding values/perspectives that might be miss-
ing from community LMs.
Cultural Community LMs By default, our pool
of community LMs includes perspective-informed
communities from news and social media (Feng
et al., 2023), where data is collected from West-
ern news media outlets and Reddit. To broaden
the scope of representation, we additionally train a
set of cultural community LMs, specifically by
employing the CultureBank corpora (Shi et al.,
2024). We partition the cultural texts by conti-
nent and adapt one community LM to represent
the cultural norms of each continent. We either
substitute the perspective community LMs with
the cultural ones or employ a mixture of both. Ta-
ble 4 demonstrates that the cultural community
LMs have varying impacts depending on the use
case. For Steerable-OpinionQA where the goalis aligning with US-centric survey data, having
cultural representation around the world actually
hurts alignment. However, for other tasks such as
Distributional-GlobalOpinionQA a mixture of per-
spective and cultural community LMs work best,
indicating that by including a pool of cultural LMs
around the world, MODULAR PLURALISM empow-
ers LLMs to go beyond West-centric viewpoints
and achieve more equitable alignment.
Patching LLMs‚Äô Gaps in Pluralism While ex-
isting LLMs go through extensive alignment be-
fore deployment, certain cultures and communi-
ties are often underrepresented (Naous et al., 2023;
Rao et al., 2024). This creates pluralism gaps ,
where alignment is not as successful for certain
domains/communities as others. MODULAR PLU-
RALISM presents a modular approach towards
patching those pluralism gaps, by training and in-
corporating a new community LM aiming to bet-
ter model that community. To investigate whether
MODULAR PLURALISM could help alleviate the
West-centric preferences of existing LLMs, we em-
ploy the default pool of perspective community
LMs while separately adding either the Asian cul-
ture community LM or the African culture commu-
nity LM to the system. We re-evaluate on Glob-
alOpinionQA and present results in Figure 6. By
adding a community LM specific for Asian/African
culture, MODULAR PLURALISM is better aligned
with survey responses for Asian and African coun-
tries (Japan and India; Nigeria and Kenya), result-
ing in an average 5.2% and 6.7% reduction in J-S
distance, while preserving the existing alignment
for other unrelated communities.
6 Related Work
Aligning LLMs with human preferences has been
an integral part of LLMs‚Äô preliminary success (Sti-
ennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Wang et al.,
2023b; Rafailov et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a; Xia
et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b). Early alignment
approaches involve training a reward model withhuman feedback and preferences, then employing
an RL algorithm such as PPO (Schulman et al.,
2017) to help learn LLMs that maximize such re-
wards (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022).
Direct preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov
et al., 2024) was later proposed to directly adapt
LLMs with human preference pairs, without ex-
plicitly training or updating a reward model. Most
recent alignment research features self-alignment
(Singh et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2024;
Sun et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2024), iterative align-
ment (Gulcehre et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024b), as
well as self-play approaches (Wu et al., 2024; Gao
et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024c).
In addition to general alignment as a technical
problem, an increasing line of work focuses on
whose preferences and which values are we align-
ing with in LLM alignment (Bai et al., 2022; San-
turkar et al., 2023). While the annotators or reward
modeling data might be diverse, the training objec-
tive of LLM alignment forces LLMs to minimize
the loss and align with an averaged human pref-
erence (Jang et al., 2023), while different users
could have distinctly different or conflicting pref-
erences informed by culture, demographics, per-
spectives, and more (Casper et al., 2023; Sorensen
et al., 2024a). To quantify the concept of plural-
ism (Berlin, 1969; Nagel, 1979; Wright, 1992),
Sorensen et al. (2024b) highlights the importance
ofpluralistic alignment and sets out three pluralism
objectives (Overton, Steerable, and Distributional).
To achieve these three objectives, we propose MOD-
ULAR PLURALISM , a modular multi-LLM collab-
oration framework to operationalize and evaluate
the three pluralism objectives. We uniquely fo-
cus on the setting of patching the pluralism gaps of
black-box LLMs by integrating several smaller LMs
specialized for community representation, in con-
trast to previous proposals where white-box LLMs
are required for RLHF tuning (Chakraborty et al.,
2024) and parameter merging (Jang et al., 2023).
7 Conclusion
We propose MODULAR PLURALISM , a multi-LLM
collaboration framework to advance pluralistic
alignment. General-purpose LLMs are augmented
with a pool of smaller but specialized commu-
nity LMs, where they interact in distinct modes
to achieve various pluralistic alignment objectives.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MODU -
LAR PLURALISM advances pluralistic alignment
across numerous models and evaluation datasets.Further analysis reveals the benefit of modularity
inMODULAR PLURALISM , that previously under-
represented communities in LLMs could be seam-
lessly patched by adding a smaller community LM
representative of their culture and values.
Limitations
To instantiate MODULAR PLURALISM , we mainly
considered perspective-informed and culture-
informed communities, while pluralistic alignment
could be equally important for other definitions of
community. We envision that any specialized com-
munity LM publicly available could be seamlessly
plugged into M ODULAR PLURALISM .
MODULAR PLURALISM comes with greater
computation costs than baselines such as plain
prompting, since a pool of community LMs are
also prompted at inference time. We argue that by
incorporating several 7B models when deploying
a user-facing LLM with hundreds of billions of
parameters, MODULAR PLURALISM does not add
too much cost. Nevertheless, we envision future
work on employing smaller community LMs to
achieve pluralistic alignment.
We employed four datasets and six evaluation
schemes that attempt to model the Overton, steer-
able, and distributional pluralism. These evalua-
tions focus on the plurality in values (Kiesel et al.,
2022; Miotto et al., 2022; Kirk et al., 2023; Wu
et al., 2023; Kang et al., 2023; Vida et al., 2023;
Huang et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024; Aroyo et al.,
2024), cultures (Mohamed et al., 2022; Ramezani
and Xu, 2023; Keleg and Magdy, 2023; CH-Wang
et al., 2023; Fung et al., 2023; Huang and Yang,
2023; Havaldar et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a;
Liu et al., 2024a; Shen et al., 2024), and perspec-
tives (Feng et al., 2023; Weerasooriya et al., 2023;
Casola et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2023; Hwang et al.,
2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b), while
future work could focus on more real-world eval-
uations of these alignment objectives, potentially
with human participants.
MODULAR PLURALISM relies on community-
representative corpora to train community LMs ,
which collaborates with larger and potentially
black-box LLMs for pluralistic alignment. While
we reuse existing resources, the large-scale col-
lection of community-specific corpora might be
challenging, and intersectional communities could
bring new challenges and opportunities to LLM
alignment.Ethics Statement
In addition to advancing pluralistic alignment,
MODULAR PLURALISM also comes with dual-
use risks: for example, hateful fringe communi-
ties might also seek better representation in LLMs,
while a community LM could be trained on hateful
social media content and integrated into MODU -
LAR PLURALISM . We argue that any application
of the system should make sure that the employed
community LMs are not specially engineered for
malicious purposes. In addition, an imbalanced or
ill-designed pool of community LMs might rein-
force stereotypes or introduce biases into LLMs,
thus efforts should be taken to broaden the scope
of community representation.

A Analysis (cont.)
Another NLI Model In addition to VitaminC
(Schuster et al., 2021) that focuses on fact-based
entailment, we additionally employ WANLI (Liu
et al., 2022) for the overton evaluation on Value
Kaleidoscope. Results in Table 5 reaffirm that
MODULAR PLURALISM successfully improves the
value coverage and overton pluralism against base-
lines approaches.
Qualitative Analysis We manually examine the
LLM outputs and present two working examples
in Figures 7 to 10. We find that for the case of
‚Äúputting an injured animal out of its misery‚Äù, while
the conventional values of being compassionate and
alleviate pain are well-discussed, different LLMs
also provide unique angles such as ‚Äúanimal care
workers or vets‚Äù might make better decisions thanMethod Unaligned Aligned

you, ‚Äúanmial welfare laws‚Äù might be involved in
the process, etc. The LLM successfully synthesises
these arguments into a coherent response, while
also adding its own aspect: ‚ÄúThey may believe that
all living creatures have a right to live, and that it
is not up to humans to decide when an animal‚Äôs
life should end.‚Äù For example two of ‚Äútaking down
4chan‚Äù, in addition to the usual aspects such as
the benefits, free speech, the First Amendment and
private organizations, community LM raises the
novel perspective that ‚ÄúIt could also backfire and
make the problem worse, as it would push 4chan‚Äôs
users to find other, presumably more secret and
hidden places to express themselves.‚Äù In summary,
MODULAR PLURALISM presents a dynamic col-
laboration between community LMs and LLMs
where the LLM presents a combination of smaller
models‚Äô comments and the parts it finds as missing.
Entropy and Distributional Pluralism Previ-
ous works have found that aligned LLMs have de-
creased entropy in token probability distributions
(Sorensen et al., 2024b), while their increased J-S
distance could be attributed to a combination of
entropy decreases and misalignment. We present
the entropy values on OpinionQA for CHATGPT
in Table 6. For aligned LLMs, MODULAR PLU-
RALISM results in higher entropy due to the aggre-
gation of community-specific distributions, curb-
ing LLMs‚Äô over-confidence and certainty. For un-
aligned LLMs, MODULAR PLURALISM has simi-
lar levels of entropy with baselines, indicating suc-
cessful steerability rather than increasing entropy
as a shortcut.
Model Sizes In the three modes of pluralism, the
LLM is tasked with various roles such as multi-
document summarization, selectively probing com-
munity LMs, and more. We evaluate the impact
ofMODULAR PLURALISM on various sizes of the
same model family with LLAMA2-7B ,13B, and
70B. Results in Table 7 demonstrate that larger
models often witness stronger improvements in plu-
ralistic alignment, while it could also work for theSetting O-VK ( ‚Üë) S-VK ( ‚Üë) S-OQA ( ‚Üì) D-MC ( ‚Üì) D-GOQA ( ‚Üì)

Computational Costs Having an extra pool of
community LMs, instead of just prompting the
black-box LLM, indeed adds computational costs.
However, it isn‚Äôt a huge overhead. When we em-
power GPT-4 with a pool of 6 7B community
LMs (the default setting of this work), it adds only
(6*7)/405=10.4% compute (we don‚Äôt know the ex-
act size of GPT-4, so taking LLaMA3-405B for
approximation), while the smaller community LMs
don‚Äôt need to be called upon every time: for ex-
ample, in steerable pluralism, only the community
LM most fitting to the steerability attribute is called
upon, so only a 7/405=1.7% extra compute.

Dataset and Evaluation Details We employ six
tasks with four datasets to evaluate the three modes
of pluralistic alignment.
1.Overton w/ NLI evaluation. We randomly
sample 3,132 situations (e.g., taking down
4chan) from the VK dataset (Sorensen et al.,
2024a) with their associated values (e.g.,
free speech) and employ an NLI model
(Schuster et al., 2021) to judge how many
values identified by VK are reflected in
LLM responses. Concretely, for an LLM
response with nsentences S={s1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,sn}
and VK‚Äôs explanation eof how this value is
related to the given situation, we calculate
maxn
i=11(NLI( si,e)is most_probable )as
whether the value is reflected somewhere in
the LLM‚Äôs response, with 1as the indicator
function, NLI produces the entailment
score, and most_probable indicates that
entailment is the most likely in the three-way
classification ( contradiction ,entailment ,
neutral ). The scores are then averaged across
all values associated with each situation and
then across situations.
2.Overton w/ human and GPT-4 evaluation.
For human evaluation, 5 annotators are
employed to reflect on 100 response pairs:
‚ÄúPlease reflect on whether the two responses
reflect pluralistic values with regard to the
given situation. ‚Äù A tie is also allowed. A
similar evaluation is conducted with GPT-4
but with 600 pairs in total with the prompt
‚ÄúPlease evaluate which of the two responses
better reflects pluralistic values given a
situation. <situation> <response #1>
<response #2> Which response better reflects
pluralistic values, or is it a tie? Please
directly answer with 1, 2, or tie.
3.Steerable w/ Value Kaleidoscope. We evalu-
ate the three-way classification of support ,op-
pose, oreither over 21,840 (value, situation)
pairs, or binary without the either examples.
Forprompting andMODULAR PLURALISM ,
we additionally include ‚ÄúPlease comment on
the situation with respect to the value. ‚Äù in the
prompt.

the prompt.
5.Distributional w/ MoralChoice. LLMs are
tasked with reasoning over which action might
be more desirable and producing a token
probability distribution [p1, p2]over the two
choices. For low-ambiguity scenarios where
humanity often has a clear consensus, LLM
distributions should match that consensus of
[1,0]if the first action is more desirable. For
high-ambiguity scenarios, LLMs should be ex-
pressing uncertainty with distributions close
to[0.5,0.5]. We use the Jensen‚ÄìShannon dis-
tance to measure the distributional differences
between LLM outputs and the objectives.
6.Distributional w/ GlobalOpinionQA. For
prompting and MODULAR PLURALISM ,
we additionally include ‚ÄúYou are from the
country of <country>‚Äù in the prompt. We
randomly sample 28,763 survey questions
from GlobalOpinionQA (Durmus et al.,
2023).
For the LLAMA2-70B model, due to comput-
ing contains we randomly sample 20% of data for
evaluation.Baseline Details For each setting of the large
language model, we employ three baselines and
compare them against MODULAR PLURALISM :
vanilla ,prompting , and MoE . For vanilla , the LLM
is directly prompted without any prefix or modifi-
cation. For prompting , a sentence is added to in-
duce pluralism: ‚Äú Make sure your response reflects
diverse values and perspectives for the following
instruction. ‚Äù For MoE , we provide the LLM with
the instruction and the description of each commu-
nity LMs, then ask to select one community LM
that is most fitting for the task. The selected LM
is then prompted to generate comments, and the
LLM generates the final response conditioned on
the comments and the instruction.
Model Details For the large language model,
we employ LLAMA2-13B (meta-llama/Llama-
2-13b-hf andmeta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf ),
CHATGPT (davinci-002 and gpt-3.5-turbo ),
LLAMA2-7B (meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf and
meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf ), LLAMA2-
70B (meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hf and meta-
llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf ), LLAMA3-8B
(meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B and meta-
llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct ), and GEMMA -
7B(google/gemma-7b andgoogle/gemma-7b-it ).Note that we are not certain that gpt-3.5-turbo is
the aligned version of davinci-002 , but we make
the same assumption as in Sorensen et al. (2024b)
due to model availability.
Implementation Details We employ block size
of 128, batch size of 64, learning rate of 1e-6,
weight decay of 1e-2, 1 training epoch, 16-bit pre-
cision, and LoRA fine-tuning (Hu et al., 2021) with
default hyperparameters for causal language model-
ing, which adapts the mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-
v0.1 checkpoint to community LMs on community-
representative corpora. The demographic prior in
distributional pluralism is by default kept uniform.
We employ greedy decoding by default, and tem-
perature œÑ= 1when randomness/sampling is de-
sired: for example, when sampling diverse com-
ments from the pool of community LMs. Both
community LMs and the LLM could generate at
most 512 new tokens.Community LM 1:Icompletely support putting asuffering animal outofitsmisery ifitisin
