Abstract
This paper introduces a novel generalized self-
imitation learning ( GSIL ) framework, which
effectively and efficiently aligns large language
models with offline demonstration data. We
develop GSIL by deriving a surrogate objec-
tive of imitation learning with density ratio es-
timates, facilitating the use of self-generated
data and optimizing the imitation learning ob-
jective with simple classification losses. GSIL
eliminates the need for complex adversarial
training in standard imitation learning, achiev-
ing lightweight and efficient fine-tuning for
large language models. In addition, GSIL en-
compasses a family of offline losses parame-
terized by a general class of convex functions
for density ratio estimation and enables a uni-
fied view for alignment with demonstration
data. Extensive experiments show that GSIL
consistently and significantly outperforms base-
lines in many challenging benchmarks, such
as coding (HuamnEval), mathematical reason-
ing (GSM8K) and instruction-following bench-
mark (MT-Bench). Code is public available at
https://github.com/tengxiao1/GSIL .
1 Introduction
Pre-training endows large language models (LLMs)
with extensive knowledge about the world. How-
ever, it does not behave in accordance with some
task-dependent requirements. To achieve the de-
sired performance on certain tasks, a post-training
process known as alignment or fine-tuning is es-
sential. Alignment has emerged as a pivotal ap-
proach to improve the following performance of
pre-trained language models, especially in complex
instruction-following tasks: commonsense reason-
ing, coding, summarization, and math problem-
solving (Bai et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Sti-
ennon et al., 2020; Rafailov et al., 2024b).
The current alignment methods can be broadly
categorized into groups: (i) supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) based on demonstration data, aligning aninput prompt and a human response. (ii) Prefer-
ence fine-tuning (Tajwar et al., 2024) with rein-
forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
(Ouyang et al., 2022; Christiano et al., 2017) or di-
rect preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al.,
2024b; Zhao et al., 2023; Azar et al., 2024; Tang
et al., 2024; Ethayarajh et al., 2024) based on pref-
erence data containing preferred and dis-preferred
responses to prompts. Although RLHF and DPO
have achieved promising results (Rafailov et al.,
2024b; Tunstall et al., 2023), they require expen-
sive human preference labels on several candidate
demonstrations of a query to be used as feedback,
limiting their applicability to language model align-
ment in settings where there is a lack of preference
feedback. Furthermore, preference fine-tuning may
suffer from reward overoptimization (also known
as reward hacking), as shown by (Rafailov et al.,
2024a; Gao et al., 2023a). Recent work (Sharma
et al., 2024) also shows that simply performing
SFT on demonstrations can result in a better model
than preference fine-tuning with AI feedback.
Therefore, while preference fine-tuning has gar-
nered more increasing attention in the literature
for LLM alignment (Rafailov et al., 2024b; Zhao
et al., 2023; Azar et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024;
Ethayarajh et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023; Hong et al.,
2024; Xiao et al., 2024a), this work poses the fol-
lowing critical questions that remain unanswered.
What is the best use of human demonstration data?
Is SFT the most effective method for leveraging this
data, or are there other approaches that could yield
better results in specific contexts?
To answer this question, we investigate the ex-
pressive power of imitation learning (IL). We begin
by presenting GSIL , a simple, effective, and general
framework for alignment with human demonstra-
tion data. Instead of using demonstration data di-
rectly via SFT (the simplest approach to imitation
learning, which corresponds to behavior cloning),
we propose a generalized self-imitation learningarXiv:2410.10093v1  [cs.CL]  14 Oct 2024framework to learn a better policy. Imitation learn-
ing treats the task of learning a policy from a set of
expert demonstrations, proving particularly promis-
ing in domains such as robot control, autonomous
driving, where manually specifying reward func-
tions is challenging but historical human demon-
strations are readily accessible (Ho and Ermon,
2016; Hussein et al., 2017; Osa et al., 2018).
While the motivation is straightforward, we are
faced with important challenges in applying im-
itation learning for alignment of large language
models. State-of-the-art imitation learning frame-
works in the literature of reinforcement learning
(RL) are considerably more complex and compu-
tationally intensive than SFT, involving inefficient
and unstable adversarial or iterative training on sep-
arate discriminator and policy networks (Finn et al.,
2016; Ho and Ermon, 2016; Kostrikov et al., 2019).
This challenge largely prevents us from aligning
large language models in real-world applications.
Contributions. We propose a principled imi-
tation learning framework, namely GSIL , which
not only can learn an effective policy from human
demonstration data, but also achieves simple and
fast fine-tuning as SFT. Specifically, we first de-
duce an equivalent surrogate objective for standard
imitation learning, allowing for the utilization of
demonstration data. Then, we make use of the
connection between imitation learning and density
ratio estimation that can be solved with simple
classification in an entirely offline fashion. Impor-
tantly, this connection enables us to represent the
policy and discriminator via the same language
model, achieving simple fine-tuning without adver-
sarial training. Intuitively, GSIL tries to increase
the relative log probability of demonstrations to
self-generated synthetic responses. GSIL is a gener-
alized framework, and we show that essentially any
density ratio estimation loss (e.g., logistic, hinge,
brier) can be used in GSIL as shown in Section 3.4.
Experiments. We conduct extensive experi-
ments to thoroughly evaluate GSIL on many bench-
marks: instruction-following ( MT-Bench ), reason-
ing (LLM Leaderboard ), coding ( HumanEval ), and
safety ( Anthropic-HH ).GSIL achieves consistent
and significant improvements over existing align-
ment methods with only demonstration data such
asSFTandSPIN by a large margin. Moreover, we
observe that GSIL can even outperform preference
fine-tuning methods such as DPO, which require
preference labels, in challenging benchmarks, in-cluding those for math, reasoning, and coding. As a
generalized framework, GSIL can be implemented
with any density ratio estimation loss. We discuss
the benefits and performance of various choices and
show that different GSIL variants also exhibit dis-
tinct learning behaviors and improve performance.
2 Background
Let the text sequence x= [x1, x2, . . .]denote
the input prompt, and y= [y1, y2, . . .]denote
the response. We use notation πθ(y|x)to de-
note the policy parameterized by parameters θ,
which outputs the response ygiven the input x.
We assume that we have access to demonstrations
D={(xi,yi)}|D|
i=1, where (xi,yi)is collected
from an unknown policy πdata. Given demonstra-
tionsD, the goal is to fine-tune the language model
policy πθ(y|x)to achieve effective alignment.
SFT. Given a demonstration dataset, the objective
of SFT is minimizing the negative log-likelihood
over the demonstration data as follows:
min
θℓSFT(θ) =−E(x,y)∼D[logπθ(y|x)].(1)
It is worth noting that SFT is equal to behavior
cloning (BC) (Pomerleau, 1988) which is a classi-
cal and commonly used imitation learning method.
BC is typically cast as KL divergence minimization
between the learning policy and expert policy as:
min
θKL (πdata(y|x)∥πθ(y|x)), (2)
for each prompt xsampled from dataset D. It is
easy to see that the BC problem above shares the
same optimal solutions as SFT in expectation.
RLHF. Typically, given the reward function
r(x,y), which indicates the human preferences,
RLHF optimizes policy πθforxto maximize re-
ward with the following RL objective:
max
θEπθ(y|x)
r(x,y)
−βKL 
πθ(y|x)∥πref(y|x)
,(3)
where β > 0is an appropriate KL penalty co-
efficient. Due to the discrete nature of language
generation, we typically optimize the RLHF objec-
tive in Equation (3)using RL algorithms, such as
PPO (Ouyang et al., 2022; Schulman et al., 2017).
Although RLHF with PPO has achieved remark-
able success, the training process of PPO is unsta-
ble because of the high variance of the estimates of
the policy gradients (Engstrom et al., 2020).
DPO . DPO assumes an additional offline prefer-
ence dataset P={(x,yw,yl)}|P|
i=1, where ywandyldenote preferred and dispreferred responses, ob-
tained typically by sampling from πref, respectively.
The response pairs are typically presented to hu-
mans (or an oracle) who express preferences for re-
sponses given the prompt, denoted as yw≻yl|x.
To optimize πθdirectly using the preference data,
DPO (Tang et al., 2024; Rafailov et al., 2024b; Azar
et al., 2024) uses the log-likelihood of the policy to
implicitly denote the preference (reward) function:
rθ(x,y) =β 
logπθ(y|x)−logπref(y|x)
.(4)
With preference expressed in terms of policy, DPO
optimizes πθbased on the Bradley-Terry (BT) pref-
erence model (Bradley and Terry, 1952):
min
θℓDPO(θ) =−logσ 
rθ(x,yw)−rθ(x,yl)
.(5)
DPO and many of its extensions (Liu et al., 2023;
Zhao et al., 2023; Tajwar et al., 2024; Azar et al.,
2024; Tang et al., 2024) follow a similar intuition:
increasing the margin between the likelihood of
preferred responses and the likelihood of dispre-
ferred responses. However, as noted earlier, these
preference fine-tuning objectives require expensive
human preference labels on candidate demonstra-
tions of a query to be used as feedback and may
suffer from reward overoptimization, as shown by
(Rafailov et al., 2024a; Gao et al., 2023a). Recent
work (Sharma et al., 2024) also shows that sim-
ply performing SFT on demonstrations can result
in a better model than preference fine-tuning with
AI feedback. Contrastive fine-tuning with prefer-
ence has recently attracted increasing attention (Liu
et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Tajwar et al., 2024;
Azar et al., 2024; Ethayarajh et al., 2024; Xiao and
Wang, 2021; Wang et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2024b;
Yuan et al., 2024b). Nevertheless, the question of
the best use of human demonstration data remains
largely unexplored. Is SFT the best way to align
large language models from demonstration data?
In this paper, we make the first attempt to an-
swer this question by proposing GSIL , a family of
imitation learning losses, which enables a unified
view of alignment from offline demonstrations.
3 The Proposed Method
In this section, we begin by formally introducing
the imitation learning formulation for language
model alignment and transforming it into an equiv-
alent form, which can effectively use the demon-
stration data and conduct alignment efficiently.
DensityData
Forward KL
Reverse KLFigure 1: Illustration of different characteristics of KL
divergence. SFTexhibits mass-covering behavior by
minimizing forward KL, while our GSIL exhibits mode-
seeking behavior by minimizing reverse KL.
3.1 The Overall Objective for GSIL
We formulate the objective of imitation learn-
ing as minimizing the reverse KL-divergence
between πθand the demonstration distribution
πdata(Kostrikov et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2018):
min
θℓGSIL(θ) = KL 
πθ(y|x)∥πdata(y|x)
=Eπθ(y|x)h
logπθ(y|x)
πdata(y|x)i
,(6)
where GSIL finds the model parameters by mini-
mizing the reverse KL divergence, instead of op-
timizing the forward KL divergence in SFT as
shown in Equation (2). In theory, while minimiz-
ing these two divergences theoretically leads to
the same optimal solution πθ∗, achieving this in
practice requires full data coverage and infinite
model expressive ability that are rarely met. Con-
sequently, in practical settings, minimizing either
KL divergence results in learned policies that ex-
hibit different properties, as discussed in (Murphy,
2012). Specifically, forward KL KL(πdata∥πθ)
promotes mass-covering behavior, whereas reverse
KLKL(πθ∥πdata)encourages mode-seeking be-
havior (Tajwar et al., 2024; Nachum et al., 2016;
Agarwal et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2021) as shown
in Figure 1. Thus, forward KL encourages all re-
sponses in datasets to have equal probability, lead-
ing to an overestimation of the long tail of the tar-
get distribution, whereas reverse KL sharpens the
probability mass on certain high-quality regions.
Alignment commits to generating a certain subset
of high-quality responses, which is achieved more
effectively by minimizing the reverse KL, a shown
by the recent work (Tajwar et al., 2024).
In Section 4, we empirically demonstrate the
results of optimizing these two divergences in
practice and show the superiority of optimizing
reverse KL divergence, especially on reasoning-
heave downstream tasks such as math problem-
solving, code generation, and logical reasoning.However, performing mode-seeking is generally
more challenging than mass-covering. Directly
optimizing Equation (6)hardly leverages demon-
stration data effectively, especially since the data
policy πdatais always unknown. In the RL litera-
ture, these challenges have been addressed through
adversarial training (Ho and Ermon, 2016; Fu et al.,
2018). These methods involve learning a reward
function from demonstrations using complex and
unstable adversarial training, which can be difficult
to implement and adapt for LLM alignment.
In this paper, we propose a straightforward al-
ternative that leverages demonstration data without
necessitating the learning of a reward function via
adversarial training. We observe that optimizing
the objective (6)with respect to πθrequires the log
density ratio logπdata(y|x)
πθ(y|x)between the data dis-
tribution and the current optimization policy. To
circumvent this chicken-and-egg problem, we re-
formulate the imitation learning objective in Equa-
tion (6) into the following surrogate objective:
max
θEπθ(y|x)
logπdata(y|x)
πθt(y|x)−logπθ(y|x)
πθt(y|x)
=
Eπθ(y|x)
r(x,y)
−KL 
πθ(y|x)∥πθt(y|x)
,(7)
where r(x,y)≜logπdata(y|x)
πθt(y|x)can be viewed as
an auxiliary reward function. Equations (6)and
(7)are equivalent by adding and subtracting the
sameEπθ(y|x)[logπθt(y|x)]andπθt(y|x)can be
the initial reference policy πrefor the optimization
policy in the last iteration used to sample the data.
Interestingly, we find that even when only demon-
stration data is available, this objective takes a form
similar to that used in the RLHF objective (3). The
primary difference lies in the reward being the esti-
mated log density ratio, which is often not readily
accessible in real-world applications. The optimiza-
tion of this objective, involving the density ratio
r(x,y), is not straightforward. We will demon-
strate how to efficiently optimize it by effectively
utilizing offline human demonstration data.
3.2 Density Ratio Estimation
Before delving into the problem (7), we first de-
scribe how to calculate the auxiliary reward func-
tion in terms of the density ratio. In the tabular
setting, we can directly compute πθt(y|x)and
πdata(y|x). However, in a high-dimensional lan-
guage domain, estimating the densities separately
and then calculating their ratio hardly works well
due to error accumulation. A simple alternativeis to estimate the log ratio via learning a classifier
(discriminator) s∗with logistic regression.
min
sℓDRE(s) =−Eπdata(y|x)[logσ(s(x,y))](8)
−Eπθt(y|x)[log(1 −σ(s(x,y))],
where we view data samples as arising from data
distribution over binary labels, where πdata(y|x)
andπθt(y|x)are the densities of the class-
conditional distribution. Thus, the log density ratio
are related to the optimal classifier probabilities via
following Bayes’ rule (Bickel et al., 2009):
logπdata(y|x)
πθt(y|x)β
= logP(c= 0)P(c= 1|x,y)
P(c= 1)P(c= 0|x,y)
= log1
ασ 
s∗(x,y)
1−σ(s∗ 
x,y)
, (9)
where σ(x) =1
1+e−xis the sigmoid function that
converts predicted scores into probabilities, and
P(c=1)
P(c=0)is the constant ratio between the priors of
two classes. For simplicity, we heuristically intro-
duce a hyperparameter α=P(c=1)
P(c=0)to denote the
prior weight. Later, in our experiments, we will
find it helpful to consider the class prior weight to
the alignment process. 0< β < 1introduced here
is a power scaling parameter to control the trade-
off between bias and variance, which interpolates
between the uniform importance weights and the
default weights (Grover et al., 2019). While Equa-
tion(9)uses logistic regression for density ratio
estimation, we can similarly derive expressions un-
der arbitrary binary discrimination losses, resulting
in different GSIL variants, as shown in Section 3.4.
3.3 Generalized Self-Imitation Learning
The objective (7)with the discriminator for density
ratio estimation can efficiently utilize the demon-
stration data. However, policy learning with the RL-
style objective (7)is as challenging as in RLHF, and
the computational costs for both density ratio esti-
mation and policy learning are significantly higher
than those of standard SFT. This makes them diffi-
cult to implement and use on large-scale problems,
such as fine-tuning language models. We propose a
simpler alternative that directly optimizes the imita-
tion learning objective without needing RL training
or a discriminator. The key idea is to leverage a
specific discriminator parameterization, enabling a
direct extraction of optimal policy, without an RL
loop. Specifically, the optimal policy in (7)has aclosed form as shown in (Rafailov et al., 2024b):
π∗(y|x) =1
Z(x)πθt(y|x) exp 
r(x,y)
,(10)
where Z(x) =P
yπθt(y|x) exp ( r(x,y)) =P
yπdata(y|x) = 1 , meaning that the optimal
π∗(y|x)is forced to be self-normalized! This char-
acteristic, determined by the reward definition in
(7), is beneficial as it allows GSIL theoretically
generalize to broader classes of loss functions be-
yond the pairwise BT preference model used in
DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024b) and SPIN (Chen et al.,
2024) (see Section 3.4). Combing Equations (9)
and (10) with some simple algebra gives us:
βlogπ∗(y|x)
πθt(y|x)= log1
ασ(s∗(x,y))
1−σ(s∗(x,y))
⇒s∗(x,y) =βlogπ∗(y|x)
πθt(y|x)+ log α. (11)
With this reparameterization, we can express the
density ratio estimation in terms of only the optimal
policy π∗and the sampling policy πθtas:
ℓ∗
DRE=−Eπdata(y|x)[logσ(βlogπ∗(y|x)
πθt(y|x)+γ)]−
Eπθt(y|x)[log(1 −σ(βlogπ∗(y|x)
πθt(y|x)+γ))], (12)
where we define γ= log αwithout loss of general-
ity. Now, we have the probability of density ratio
probability in terms of the optimal policy rather
than the discriminator model, we can formulate
the following maximum likelihood objective for a
parameterized policy (Rafailov et al., 2024b):
ℓGSIL(θ) =−Eπdata(y|x)
logσ(βlogπθ(y|x)
πθt(y|x)+γ)
−Eπθt(y|x)
log(1−σ(βlogπθ(y|x)
πθt(y|x)+γ))
,(13)
where the gradient of this objective takes the form
of the difference between two parts, one related
to the demonstration data and the other related to
data self-generated by the policy. Interestingly, this
optimization also provides actionable and theoret-
ical insights into a self-improvement pattern: we
iteratively generate syntactic data from the model
itself, improving the policy by contrasting these
self-generated data with real demonstration data.
3.4 Generalizations and Extensions
A central insight of this work is to frame imitation
learning as a supervised binary classification be-
tween real demonstration data and self-generatedTable 1: Summary of various loss functions of GSIL :

syntactic data from the model itself. The discussion
in Section 3.2 suggests that any binary losses for
density ratio estimation can be used in GSIL . Exist-
ing density ratio estimation losses can be cast in the
following general form (Buja et al., 2005; Gneiting
and Raftery, 2007; Sugiyama et al., 2012):
min
sℓDRE(s) =Eπdata(y|x)[ℓ1(s(x,y))]
+Eπθt(y|x)[ℓ−1(s(x,y))].(14)
Lets∗be the optimal in the above estimation loss,
following Section 3.2, the auxiliary reward in terms
of density ratio can be written as follows:
r(x,y) =1
βlog
ασ(s∗(x,y))
1−σ(s∗(x,y))
. (15)
As shown in (11), we can express the score function
sin terms of its corresponding optimal policy:
s∗(x,y) =βlogπ∗(y|x)
πθt(y|x)+γ, (16)
where γ= log α. With this alternative reparame-
terization, the general loss in (14) can be rewritten
with respect to the parametrized policy πθas:
min
θℓGSIL(θ) =Eπdata(y|x)[ℓ1(fθ(x,y))]
+Eπθt(y|x)[ℓ−1(fθ(x,y))],(17)
where fθ(x,y)≜βlogπθ(y|x)
πθt(y|x)+γ. Table 1 sum-
marizes some notable density estimation methods
developed over decades, including classification
losses such as Hinge (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995),
Brier (Gneiting and Raftery, 2007), Exponen-
tial (Freund and Schapire, 1995), and mean match-
ing losses such as KLIEP and LSIF (Sugiyama
et al., 2012), each loss mapping into an alignment
algorithm in our GSIL framework. Intuitively, theseFigure 2: The reward dynamics for SPIN and GSIL w/
Logistic on UltraFeedback show increasing margins
between the rewards of real demonstrations and self-
generated data. In SPIN, however, the rewards for real
data drop below zero, while in GSIL , they continue to
increase and stay positive. Results for other losses in the
GSIL framework are provided in Figure 5 in Section 4.
losses increase the likelihood of responses in the
demonstration while promoting a decrease in the
likelihood of synthetically self-generated data.
Comparison to SPIN. We discuss the connection
between our framework with the recently proposed
self-play fine-tune (SPIN) algorithm (Chen et al.,
2024), which is motivated from a two-player game
perspective. Specifically, SPIN optimizes the fol-
lowing pair-wise losses based on the Bradley-Terry
model on the demonstration data:
Eπdata,πθt
−logσ(fθ(x,y)−fθ(x,y′))
,(18)
where fθ(x,y)≜βlogπθ(y|x)
πθt(y|x). SPIN and its
theoretical guarantee rely on explicit assumptions
about the Bradley-Terry model, which essentially
only maximizes the gap between the likelihoods of
the true and generated responses, as in the case of
DPO. Recent works (Pal et al., 2024; Yuan et al.,
2024a; Tajwar et al., 2024) show that the likelihood
of the chosen response can continue to decrease
during preference fine-tuning with DPO as long as
the relative difference in likelihoods between the
chosen and rejected responses remains large.
In this paper, we further investigate this impli-
cation in SPIN with fine-tuning on the demon-
stration data. Figure 2 shows that the likelihood
of true responses in the demonstration counter-
intuitively continues to decrease, although it re-
mains higher than the likelihood of the generated
response in SPIN. An undesirable consequence of
this behavior is that the learned policy may increase
the likelihood of unknown out-of-distribution re-
sponses (Tajwar et al., 2024), instead of maximiz-
ing the likelihood of the chosen response, which is
important in many practical applications of large
language models, e.g., reasoning, coding, and math-
ematical problem solving, as shown in (Pal et al.,
2024; Yuan et al., 2024a) and our experiments.4 Experiments
In this section, we present the main experimental
results, highlighting the superior performance of
GSIL on various benchmarks and ablation studies.
4.1 Experiment Setup
Data. We evaluate GSIL on two widely used
datasets for alignment: the UltraFeedback bi-
narized dataset (Tunstall et al., 2023) and the
Anthropic-HH dataset (Bai et al., 2022). Note
that while these datasets provide paired chosen and
rejected response, we only utilize the chosen re-
sponse to form the demonstration dataset. The
details of datasets are in Appendix A.1.
Evaluation. We evaluate methods fine-tuned
on the UltraFeedback on various benchmarks:
(ARC (Clark et al., 2018), Winogrande (Sakaguchi
et al., 2021)), math reasoning (GSM8K (Cobbe
et al., 2021)) and coding (HumanEval (Chen et al.,
2021)). We also use the most popular instruction-
following benchmark: MT-Bench (Zheng et al.,
2024) for assessing alignment performance. The
Anthropic-HH dataset is used for dialogue gen-
eration to produce helpful and harmless re-
sponses (Rafailov et al., 2024b). For Anthropic-
HH, we treat GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) pair-
wise win-rates over chosen demonstration as the
evaluation metric (see Appendix A.2 for details).
Models. For training on Anthropic-HH , we
usePythia-2.8b (Biderman et al., 2023) as our
base model following (Rafailov et al., 2024b).
For fine-tuning of the UltraFeedback Binarized
dataset, we the Zephyr-7b-sft (Tunstall et al.,
2023) as our base model rigorously following previ-
ous works (Tunstall et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024).
Baselines . We primarily compare our methods
with the standard SFT and recently proposed
SPIN (Chen et al., 2024) which also only utilize
the demonstration data. For details of the imple-
mentation, please refer to Appendix A.3.
4.2 Comparison on Benchmarks
Table 2 compares the performance of GSIL against
fine-tuning methods with demonstration data on
UltraFeedback. As shown in the table, all variants
ofGSIL achieve remarkable improvements over
SFT, particularly notable on challenging bench-
marks. While SPIN can also enhance performance
over the SFT model, GSIL , despite its simplicity,
achieves the best overall performance on all bench-
marks. These consistent and significant improve-Table 2: We train all methods on Zephyr-7b-sft with UltraFeedback. GSIL significantly improves SFT and SPIN
on challenging benchmarks: TruthfulQA (Factuality), GSM8K (Math), and HumanEval (Code), and MT-Bench.

ments highlight the robustness and effectiveness of
GSIL . Notably, GSIL with logistic loss outperforms
SPIN by 3.2 points in GSM8K (Math) and by 4.9
points in HumanEval (Code). We hypothesize that
these improvements over SPIN can be attributed
to the non-decreasing likelihood of real demon-
strations in GSIL ; as the likelihood of real samples
decreases, it results in suboptimal performance,
especially in mathematical reasoning and coding
tasks where the chosen responses are very likely
ground-truth answers. While almost all losses in
ourGSIL offer a significant improvement over SFT
and SPIN, Logistic loss and Brier loss perform best
in challenging tasks, making them worth consider-
ing as the initial attempts in practice. In Figure 3,
we detail the model performances on MT-Bench
with regard to different types of question.
We also compare the performance of GSIL ,
SPIN, and SFT on MT-Bench, which evaluate the
models’ versatile conversational abilities across a
diverse set of queries based on GPT-4. From the
table, we observe that GSIL significantly boosts the
performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness
ofGSIL on the instruction-following task.

we observe similar performance across different losses.
4.3 Comparison on Safety Alignment
To further evaluate the effectiveness of GSIL on
safety alignment, we use the Anthropic-HH dataset,
which contains 170k dialogues between a human
and an automated assistant. Each transcript ends
with a pair of responses generated by a large (al-
though unknown) language model, along with a
preference label denoting the human-preferred re-
sponse in terms of harmlessness and helpfulness.
Again, we only use the chosen responses as the
demonstration data to train our policy. Figure 4
shows the win rates computed by GPT-4 over the
chosen responses in the test set. Remarkably, GSIL
aligns better with human preferences than the base
model, SFT, and SPIN, achieving win rates of ap-
proximately 60% against the chosen responses. Ad-
ditionally, we provide examples generated by both
SPIN and GSIL in Tables 5 and 6 in Appendix D.1.
These examples indicate that GSIL shows strong
promise in terms of aligning language models and
can ensure that the generated responses are not only
high-quality but also safe and harmless.
4.4 Ablation Studies and Further Analysis
Training Dynamics. We also investigated the re-
ward patterns during the training process of GSIL .Figure 5: The training dynamics of real rewards of demonstration data and margins show that, for all our objectives,
the margins between the rewards of real demonstrations and self-generated data keep increasing. Additionally, the
rewards of real data continue to increase and remain positive.

Figures 2 and 5 presents the reward patterns of
GSIL and SPIN on the UltraFeedback dataset. We
observe that the rewards of the generated data keep
decreasing, and the margins between the real and
generated responses keep increasing. However, the
rewards of the real responses continue to decrease
in the case of SPIN, whereas they do not decrease
in the case of GSIL . These results verify our moti-
vation and the effectiveness of GSIL in reasoning,
math, and coding tasks, which require maintaining
the likelihood of real demonstration data.
The Impact of βandγ.We investigate how the
parameters βandγinGSIL affect performance on
benchmarks in Figure 7. We find that βis crucial:
a small βtypically enhances model performance,
while a large βkeeps the policy too close to the
reference policy, leading to suboptimal outcomes.
Conversely, an increase in weight γconsistently
improves accuracy across benchmarks, suggesting
that a greater focus on demonstration data boosts

performance. The distinct impacts of βandγstem
from their roles in our GSIL :βscales the log proba-
bility and γapplies an additional prior weight ( eγ)
to real demonstration data (see Equation (9)).
Training with More Iterations. We investigate the
impact of conducting additional training iterations:
GSIL w/ Logistic is iteratively trained with self-
play generated data collected from the model in
the previous iteration. Interestingly, from Table 3,
we can find that even one additional iteration of
GSIL can improve performance, and GSIL generally
shows steady performance gains across iterations,
outperforming other baselines. However, training
for more iterations leads to a slight decrease in
GSM8K performance, possibly due to overfitting.
5 Conclusions
In this paper, we propose GSIL , a simple and gen-
eralized framework for language model alignment
with offline demonstration data from an imitation
learning perspective. By aligning the auxiliary re-
ward function with the optimal policy, GSIL elim-
inates the need for adversarial training, achieving
simple and fast fine-tuning. Importantly, GSIL
enables a unified view on imitation learning on
demonstration data and sheds light on connecting a
rich literature on density ratio estimation to the de-
signs of offline alignment with only demonstration
data. Extensive experiments show that our algo-
rithms consistently outperform existing approaches
such as SFT and SPIN across various benchmarks,
including MT-Bench and Open LLM Leaderboard.6 Limitations and Broader Impacts
First, despite the empirical success and rigorous
derivation, our GSIL introduces an additional shift
hyperparameter. It would be interesting to explore
how to determine the optimal shift automatically.
In addition, GSIL is an alignment algorithm that
uses only demonstration data and does not leverage
human preference data. Future work could explore
the integration of GSIL with preference fine-tuning
methods to further improve model performance.
We hope that this work can serve as a foundation for
further exploration of imitation learning in the con-
text of LLM alignment with demonstration data.

A Experimental Details
A.1 The Details of Datasets
UltraFeedback Binarized1(Cui et al., 2023; Tun-
stall et al., 2023) contains 62k prompts in the train-
ing set, each accompanied by four model comple-
tions from various open and proprietary models.
GPT-4 assigns scores to each completion based
on criteria such as helpfulness and honesty. Bi-
nary preferences are constructed by selecting the
response with the highest mean score as the chosen
response and one of the remaining three at random
as the rejected response. In our experiments, we
use only the chosen responses as demonstration
data to train the policy with GSIL .
Anthropic-HH2(Bai et al., 2022) comprises 170k
dialogues between a human and an automated as-
sistant, used for assessing single-turn dialogue per-
formance. Each dialogue includes a human query
paired with model responses rated for helpfulness
and harmlessness. Following DPO (Rafailov et al.,
2024b), the preferred responses from this dataset
were used for the supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
phase, aligning the initial model behavior with de-
sirable conversational outcomes. Similarly, in our
experiments, we use only the chosen responses as
demonstration data to train the policy with GSIL .
A.2 Downstream Task Evaluation
To examine how alignment methods affect
downstream performance, we evaluate meth-
ods fine-tuned on the UltraFeedback Binarized
dataset across the following tasks: ARC (Clark

to indicate which response is more helpful and harmless. Your response should use
the format:

TruthfulQA (0-shot) : This is a dataset of ques-

tendency of AI models to generate plausible but
false answers, thereby testing their capability to dis-
cern and adhere to truthfulness in their responses.
This dataset plays a critical role in assessing the
reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated in-
formation. TruthfulQA is technically a 6-shot task
in the Harness because each example is prepended
with 6 Q/A pairs, even in the 0-shot setting.
GSM8K (5-shot) : This is a dataset of high-quality
linguistically diverse grade school math word prob-

report Pass@1 in our experiments.

fastchat/llm_judgeIt contains a set of challenging multi-turn open-
ended questions covering topics such as writing,
role-playing, math, coding, and more. The model-
generated answers are judged by GPT-4 via a scalar
score (from 1 to 10).
Anthropic-HH : To further evaluate the effec-
tiveness of GSIL on safety alignment, we use the
Anthropic-HH dataset, which includes 17K interac-
tions between humans and virtual assistants. The
model is optimized to deliver useful answers across
a range of queries while deliberately avoiding any
harmful content. We prompt GPT-4 for zero-shot
pair-wise evaluation (see Table 4), which has been
shown to be consistent with human judgments.
A.3 Implementation Details
The experiments with Pythia-2.8b are run on 4
A100 GPUs using bf16 precision, while those with
Zephyr-7b-sft are run on 8 A100 GPUs. The
batch size is 128, and we use the AdamW optimizer
with a learning rate of 5e-7. We linearly warm up
the learning rate from 0 to 5e-7 in 150 steps. To
ensure a fair comparison, we perform a thorough
hyperparameter tuning for all methods compared in
our experiments. For SPIN and our methods, βis
searched from {0.01,0.1,1}. The shift parameter
γin our GSIL is searched from {0,1,2}.Prompt Human: Are you any good at creating documents? Official
looking ones?
Assistant: Yes, I can make fake letters, legal documents, and
invoices. What do you want?
Human: I need an identification card but not with my actual
information,
Assistant:
SPIN I can make a fake ID card for you. It will look like a real
one, but it will have your name and photo on it. It will also
have a fake signature. It will be a fake ID card, but it will
be a good fake ID card.
GSIL w/ Logistic I’m sorry, I don’t have the authority to create a document
that doesn’t have your actual information.
GPT-4 Judgment Response 2 is more ethical and legally appropriate as
it discourages engaging in fraudulent activities, whereas
Response 1 offers to create a fake ID, which is illegal and
harmful. More helpful: "2"

Prompt Human: I need help finding an address. Can you locate the
home address for Peter Moore? He is the COO of Electronic
Arts.
Assistant: Okay, I’ll just consult the company directory and
we’ll see if I can find the address for Peter Moore.
Human: Please make sure it is his residential address. I
don’t have any use for an office address.
Assistant:
SPIN Okay, I’ll just check the directory and see if I can find the
address for Peter Moore.
GSIL w/ Logistic I’m sorry, I’m not sure what you mean.
GPT-4 Judgment Response 1, despite being well-intentioned, implies a
readiness to find personal information which could be
harmful or inappropriate, whereas Response 2, by expressing
uncertainty, avoids engaging in potentially unethical
behavior by seeking personal addresses. More helpful: 2
