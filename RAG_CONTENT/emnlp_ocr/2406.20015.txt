Abstract
Tool-augmented large language models
(LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into
real-world applications. Due to the lack of
benchmarks, the community has yet to fully un-
derstand the hallucination issues within these
models. To address this challenge, we intro-
duce a comprehensive diagnostic benchmark,
ToolBH. Specifically, we assess the LLM’s
hallucinations through two perspectives: depth
and breadth. In terms of depth, we propose a
multi-level diagnostic process, including (1)
solvability detection, (2) solution planning,
and (3) missing-tool analysis. For breadth,
we consider three scenarios based on the
characteristics of the toolset: missing necessary
tools, potential tools, and limited functionality
tools. Furthermore, we developed seven
tasks and collected 700 evaluation samples
through multiple rounds of manual annotation.
The results show the significant challenges
presented by the ToolBH benchmark. The
current advanced models Gemini-1.5-Pro and
GPT-4o only achieve total scores of 45.3and
37.0, respectively, on a scale of 100. In this
benchmark, larger model parameters do not
guarantee better performance; the training
data and response strategies also play crucial
roles in tool-enhanced LLM scenarios. Our
diagnostic analysis indicates that the primary
reason for model errors lies in assessing task
solvability. Additionally, open-weight models
suffer from performance drops with verbose
replies, whereas proprietary models excel with
longer reasoning.
1 Introduction
To replicate human intelligence in artificial gen-
eral intelligence (AGI), recent studies suggest that
a promising solution is enabling large language
models (LLMs) to use tools to handle diverse com-
plex scenarios (Mialon et al., 2023). For instance,

Hallucination Response
Expected ResponseFigure 1: Hallucinations ( red) and expectations ( blue) of
the LLM’s response to the use of the task for tools that
do not have a correct answer. The problem example is
taken from the AgentBoard (Ma et al., 2024) Tool-Query
dataset, tested with ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023b). Wrong
Tool reflects a common situation where LLM uses a
provided wrong tool as the final answer; Non-existent
Tool, on the other hand, is an example of hallucination.
tool-augmented LLMs can employ various APIs or
coding tools to tackle intricate tasks, such as math-
ematical reasoning. However, as shown in Fig. 1,
several hallucinatory phenomena arise when these
LLMs attempt to use tools. Specifically, the LLMs
might utilize the wrong tools or offer solutions
with non-existent tools. This occurs because LLMs
cannot discern whether a problem is solvable with
the tools at hand, and instead, they use fictitious
tools, hindering progress in developing AGI mod-
els. Therefore, a pressing issue is assessing the hal-
lucination phenomenon when LLMs utilize tools .
However, current benchmarks for tool-based
tasks presuppose the provision of complete and
usable tools by users, primarily focusing on evalu-
ating how LLMs utilize these tools (Liu et al., 2023;
Qin et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2024). For example,arXiv:2406.20015v2  [cs.CL]  4 Oct 2024AgentBench (Liu et al., 2023) and ToolBench (Qin
et al., 2023) aim to introduce a broad array of tasks,
and AgentBoard (Ma et al., 2024) evaluate the
multi-step tool planning abilities of these models.
Although MetaTool (Huang et al., 2023) considers
incomplete lists of tools provided by users, it still
focuses solely on determining whether a task can be
completed. Therefore, to ensure a comprehensive
evaluation of the various hallucinatory phenom-
ena in tool usage, we develop the ToolBH bench-
mark. It is a multi-level hallucination diagnostic
benchmark for tool-augmented LLMs. Inspired by
medical diagnostic procedures (Wu et al., 2023)
and existing hallucination benchmarks (Ji et al.,
2023; Liu et al., 2022), ToolBH systematically as-
sesses hallucinations from perspectives of depth
and breadth (Details in Sec. 3).
In the assessment of hallucination depth , we
introduce a multi-level diagnostic procedure frame-
work that incorporates (1) solvability detection ,(2)
solution planning , and (3) missing-tool analysis .
The solvability detection task assesses whether
the user query can be addressed with the given
toolset. Subsequently, the solution planning task
requires the LLM to propose a plan of tools tai-
lored to address the task sequentially. In the end,
the missing-tool analysis task builds upon its pre-
decessor by requiring the LLM to delineate how
the tools address the specific demands in each step.
For tasks considered unsolvable, the LLM is tasked
with identifying and elaborating on the functionali-
ties of the missing tools, thereby offering insights
to aid in completing the toolkit. On the side of
breadth , we consider three critical scenarios from
the perspective of toolset features: missing neces-
sary tools, potential tools, and limited functionality
tools. Furthermore, we design seven tasks across
these scenarios, including iterative calls and opti-
mal tool selection tasks. Finally, we collect 700
samples (user query, tool set, solution) across 7
tasks through multiple rounds of human annota-
tions and establish an evaluation metric for each
diagnostic task (Details in Sec. 3.2).
We conduct experiments on 14LLMs using the
ToolBH benchmark, which includes 7proprietary
and 7open-weight models. Our analysis reveals
that despite some open-weight models achieving
competitive performance compared to proprietary
counterparts in general tasks (Beeching et al., 2023;
Contributors, 2023), they exhibit substantial gaps
in unsolvable scenarios presented by the ToolBH
benchmark. Notably, the best-performing open-weight model, Llama-3-70B, still trails behind the
proprietary models, with only 32% of the total
score of Gemini-1.5-Pro (Reid et al., 2024) and
40% of GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024), indicating con-
siderable room for improvement in open-weight
models. A detailed error analysis shows a variety
of error patterns. Proprietary models tend to exhibit
fewer instances of using non-existent tools, suggest-
ing better tool recognition capabilities. However,
they also showed higher rates of instrumental rea-
soning errors, reflecting problems comprehending
the task’s solution sequence and reasoning logic.
On the other hand, open-weight models suffer more
from solvability hallucinations, often misjudging
the complexity and feasibility of tasks. This high-
lights a critical area for enhancement in model rea-
soning.
Our findings demonstrate the significance of the
ToolBH benchmark in identifying and addressing
deficiencies in LLMs. The benchmark provides
detailed analysis and valuable insights into specific
error patterns under unsolvable LLM tool usage
scenarios, offering guidance for future research.
2 Related Work
2.1 Tool-based Benchmarks
Recent advancements in LLMs have highlighted
their potential when augmented with external tools,
prompting the development of several benchmarks
to assess their tool-using capabilities. For example,
benchmarks such as API-Bank (Li et al., 2023b),
ToolBench (Qin et al., 2023), AgentBench (Liu
et al., 2023) and AgentBoard (Ma et al., 2024)
evaluate LLMs’ capabilities in planning, retriev-
ing, and calling APIs across various tasks. More-
over, ToolQA (Zhuang et al., 2023) introduces
a dataset for assessing tool-using LLMs through
question answering, distinguishing between inter-
nal knowledge and external tool usage. However,
these benchmarks operate under a stringent assump-
tion: users will provide a list comprising all req-
uisite tools and describe each explicitly. This as-
sumption rarely holds true in real-world scenarios.
Few benchmarks (Huang et al., 2023) incorporate a
reliability test, which evaluates whether the model
can appropriately return “None” when necessary
tools are absent from the list. This approach fails
to address significant gaps, such as exploring the
reasons behind the output of “None”. To address
these challenges, we introduce ToolBH, a compre-
hensive multi-level hallucination diagnostic bench-mark. ToolBH evaluates the tool-using capabilities
of models across diverse scenarios and further in-
vestigating hallucinations to assist the community
in identifying underlying causes.
2.2 Evaluating Hallucinations in LLMs
In LLMs, hallucination occurs when the output is
inconsistent with the input, contradicts established
knowledge, or cannot be verified against factual
data (Zhang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). This phe-
nomenon challenges the reliability and credibility
of LLMs, especially in real-world applications.
To evaluate such hallucinations, current bench-
marks are introduced that focus on the discrimi-
native and generative capacities of LLMs. For in-
stance, TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) evaluates the
truthfulness of generated responses. In assessing
the ability to differentiate between real and hal-
lucinatory statements, HaluEval (Li et al., 2023a)
focuses on whether the model can accurately iden-
tify hallucinatory content within state information.
Moreover, FACTOR (Muhlgay et al., 2024) investi-
gates whether the model tends to assign higher like-
lihoods to factual statements over non-factual ones,
examining the bias toward recognizing truth. How-
ever, these benchmarks solely assess the knowledge
of large models without considering the interaction
with tools. Therefore, referencing their generative
and discriminative approaches, as well as the meth-
ods used in coding (Zhu et al., 2023) and medical
diagnosis (Wu et al., 2023), we propose a multi-
level benchmark to explore the phenomena of hal-
lucinations in the tool-augmented LLMs.
3 The ToolBH Benchmark
3.1 Design Philosophy
To comprehensively assess the hallucination phe-
nomena encountered by tool-enhanced large mod-
els, we design tasks and data processing procedures
from both the depth and breadth perspectives of hal-
lucination evaluation. Accordingly, our workflow
adheres to the following design philosophy:
• Unsolvability in real-world tasks.
• In-depth: Multi-level hallucination diagnosis.
• In-breadth: Hallucination-inducing scenarios.
Unsolvability in real-world tasks. In our obser-
vations of real-world applications, hallucinations
frequently occur when LLMs attempt to address
tool-use requests that they believe are solvable butare inherently unsolvable. We summarize these in-
stances as unsolvable long-tail tool-using tasks .
Multi-level hallucination diagnosis. Our aim is
to conduct an in-depth analysis of hallucinations
experienced by LLMs when tackling unsolvable
tasks to explore the underlying mechanisms. To
achieve this objective, we decompose these unsolv-
able tasks into three progressive stages. This de-
composition is based on the level of detail in the
responses, as detailed in Sec. 3.2.
Hallucination-inducing scenarios. In tool-based
tasks, the pivotal element is the tool-related infor-
mation, including toolsets and tool descriptions.
Therefore, we consider two hallucination-inducing
scenarios from the perspective of tool characteris-
tics (Details in Sec. 3.3).
Following these guidelines, we introduce an un-
solvable long-tail robustness assessment bench-
mark to diagnose hallucinations comprehensively
and at multiple levels.
3.2 In-depth: Multi-level Diagnostic Task
Based on unsolvable tool-using problems, we de-
sign a three-level diagnostic task framework: (1)
solvability detection, (2) solution planning, and (3)
missing-tool analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, we em-
ploy distinct metrics for each level. We present the
rationale for implementing a multi-level evaluation
framework in Appendix A.1.
3.2.1 Level-1: Solvability Detection
At the first level, the LLM assesses whether a
task is solvable from a macro-level perspective.
Specifically, by referencing the provided toolset,
the model must comprehend the user query and
the tool descriptions, then determine and indicate
whether the task is solvable or unsolvable. We
tackle this task as a binary classification task and
utilize the exact match (EM) as the metric.
3.2.2 Level-2: Solution Planning
Given that many queries require collaboration be-
tween multiple tools for completion, we explore the
model’s planning capabilities from a micro-level
perspective. Specifically, the model divides user
requests into sub-goals, utilizing the corresponding
tools in each step. Additionally, we introduce an
“UnsolvableQuery” tool to address situations where
the available tools cannot achieve the sub-goals.
Inspired by the Precisionk set retrieval evaluation
measure, we design a new progress rate (PR) met-
ric, which assesses the accuracy of a predicted tool  I  w a n t  t o  k n o w :What ports are available

Figure 2: The pipeline of ToolBH benchmark. In-breadth, we examine three scenarios (MNT, PT, LFT) that could
induce hallucinations from the perspective of the toolset. We employ an in-depth, multi-level evaluation (solvability
detection, solution planning, and missing-tool analysis) to diagnose the reasons for hallucinations in LLM.
sequence ( P) based on the ground truth ranking
(G). Specifically, PR compares each predicted tool
name ( pi) against the corresponding ground truth
tool name ( gi), terminating the comparison at the
first mismatch and treating all subsequent tools as
incorrect. The metric for each sample is defined as
follows:
PR=Pmin(k−1,|G|)
i=11(pi=gi)
|G|, (1)
where indicator function 1(pi=gi)returns 1for
a match and 0otherwise. kis the index of the first
mismatch between PandG. If there is no mis-
match (i.e., Pmatches Gcompletely), let kbe
equal to |G|+ 1, which essentially points to one
position beyond the last tool in G.
3.2.3 Level-3: Missing-Tool Analysis
Building on the requirements of level-2, this task
requires LLM candidates to provide a detailed ac-
count of the rationale behind each subtask. Specifi-
cally, for sub-goals deemed unsolvable, the model
must articulate the functions of absent tools in de-
tail, enabling further evaluation of its reasoning
ability. Therefore, we include two metrics: progress
rate (PR) and matching score (MS). While the PR
metric remains consistent with Level-2, its appli-
cation in Level-3 serves distinct purposes. It en-
ables the investigation of hallucination risks in Re-
Act (Yao et al., 2023) agent reasoning for unsolv-
able tool tasks and evaluates model consistencyacross tasks with varying context lengths.
For MS, we consider a text-matching method
for each sample. If the model identifies “Unsolv-
ableQuery” in each sub-goal, it outputs a predicted
description ( du) of the tool’s functionality. Inspired
by widely-used tool-matching algorithms (Huang
et al., 2023; Zhuang et al., 2023), we develop a
tool database that contains tool names and their
descriptions. Initially, the algorithm uses duto
search the most similar tool description from the
database. If the retrieved description matches the
golden description, the MS score for this sub-goal
is awarded a perfect score of 1.0. If a match is
not found, duand the golden description are en-
coded into embeddings using an embedding model,
namely emb uandemb g. In this paper, we use the
all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (Wang et al., 2021) as the em-
bedding model. Subsequently, the cosine similarity
between these embeddings is computed. The pro-
cess can be summarized by the equation below:
MSsub−goal=(
1.0 if matched
embT
u·embg
∥embu∥∥embg∥otherwise(2)
Finally, we compute the arithmetic mean of
MSsub−goalacross each sample’s sub-goal.
3.3 In-breadth: Tool-based
Hallucination-inducing Tasks
In breadth, we divide tool-using scenarios into three
categories based on tool characteristics: missingnecessary tools (MNT), potential tools (PT), and
limited functionality tools (LFT). In this section,
we present an overview of each scenario and its
subtasks.
3.3.1 Missing Necessary Tools (MNT)
The task becomes unsolvable when a toolset lacks
the necessary tools for task completion. Under
these conditions, LLMs might engage in hallucina-
tory behavior, such as invoking non-existent tools.
To generate unsolvable tasks, we remove a ran-
domly chosen tool from the ground truth list. In
this scenario, we consider subtasks based on the
number of steps needed to complete the task:
1. Single-step tool utilization: Completing the task
with one tool.
2. Multi-step tool utilization: Using multiple tools,
categorized into: “Without Repetition” (No tool
is reused) and “With Repetition” (Some tools are
used multiple times).
3.3.2 Potential Tools (PT)
In addition to the provided tools, some user queries
may involve specific environments like operating
systems (OS) and websites (Web). These environ-
ments may contain potential tools not specified
in user requests, making their use impermissible.
However, LLMs may inappropriately exploit these
tools. In this scenario, we construct unsolvable
tasks by removing a randomly golden tool and
adding environment details to mislead the LLM
to use non-provided or inappropriate tools. We con-
sider the following subtasks:
1. OS: Tasks may prompt the LLM to assume it is
within an OS environment, where it might consider
system commands like “rm” and “ufw” to solve the
task. The misuse of such commands could lead to
serious consequences.
2. Web: Similarly, the LLM might be induced to
use web technologies (e.g., JavaScript, SQL).
3.3.3 Limited Functionality Tools (LFT)
LFT scenarios involve correct tools with func-
tional limitations. Unsolvable tasks are generated
by adding extra requirements or constraints to
queries, task descriptions, or tools. We include the
following subtasks:
1. Iterative: These mimic multi-functional tools re-
quiring different functions at each step. Unsolvable
tasks are created by removing a required function.
For example, using tools like HanLP (He and Choi,
2021), different models are needed for various re-quirements. An unsolvable task requires a function
not listed.
2. Optimal tool selection: These scenarios involve
multiple similar-function tools where only one
meets all requirements. Unsolvable tasks are cre-
ated by making requirements more stringent. For
instance, a task might need a specific minority lan-
guage translation with strict computing resource
requirements, which no tool can fully satisfy.
3.4 Data Curation
Aligned with our design principles, we introduce a
multi-turn annotation process, including four key
steps: (1) creating seed samples, (2) synthesizing
samples, (3) filtering, and (4) constructing data
samples. The details are in Appendix A, includ-
ing prompts, filtering criteria and other details. An
overview follows:
(1) Creating seed samples. Considering the sub-
tasks outlined in Sec. 3.3, a series of seed sam-
ples are constructed, each comprising a triplet (user
query, toolset, golden solution). These samples are
created for different scenarios and subtasks that fit
our definition of these terms and are validated by
multiple team members.
(2) Synthesizing samples. We design prompt tem-
plates for each subtask (details in Appendix A.3).
After that, we insert the seed samples into these
templates and synthesize additional samples using
advanced LLMs: Gemini-1.0-Pro (Anil et al., 2023)
and GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024).
(3) Filtering. Initially, the synthesized data are fil-
tered based on similarity to seed samples to ensure
diversity, using an embedding model (Wang et al.,
2021) for semantic similarity and manual checks
for task similarity. Moreover, our team manually
reviews and removes low-quality or biased sam-
ples, such as those containing errors or specific
political biases. The detailed criteria are described
in Appendix A.2.
(4) Constructing data samples. After filtering, our
data pool is enriched with high-quality samples.
Subsequently, we randomly select fresh samples
from this pool for the next round of annotation.
We conduct multiple annotation rounds until the
number of samples meets our expectations. Ini-
tially, four seed samples are manually created for
each of seven subtasks. Through iterative refine-
ment, each subtask ultimately contains 300unique
samples. Subsequently, we select the 100samples
that exhibit the greatest variation, as determined
by both the tool descriptions and the task contexts.Table 1: Statistics of ToolBH benchmark.

Further manual review then narrows these down to
50solvable and 50unsolvable samples for each of
seven subtasks, resulting in a total of 700samples
in our ToolBH benchmark.
To enhance the comprehensiveness and utility
of our benchmark, we have structured it into three
levels of difficulty, ranging from Level-1 to Level-3.
This hierarchical structure ensures that the bench-
mark can evaluate models across a spectrum of
complexity. Each level contains an equal number
of solvable and unsolvable samples, bringing the
total number of test samples to 1,050. This aligns
our benchmark with the scale of the most recent
mainstream benchmarks (Qin et al., 2023; Ma et al.,
2024; Liu et al., 2023).
3.5 General Statistics
Table 1 provides a comprehensive statistical analy-
sis of the ToolBH benchmark, featuring 700sam-
ples with solvable and unsolvable tasks across vari-
ous scenarios. It encompasses a range of indicators,
including the number of tools provided, the number
of tools utilized, and the average number of “Un-
solvableQuery” tools used. Moreover, we employ
the Llama3 (MetaAI, 2024) tokenizer to measure
the average length of the user queries.
4 Experiments
4.1 Baselines
We collect 14widely-used LLMs, comprising 7
proprietary and 7open-weight models (Details
in Appendix C.1).
Specifically, seven proprietary models includes:
Gemini-1.0-Pro (Anil et al., 2023), Gemini-1.5-
Pro (Reid et al., 2024), GPT-3.5-Turbo (OpenAI,
2023b), GPT-4-Turbo (OpenAI, 2023a), GPT-4-
1106, GPT-4-0613 and GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024).
Given the diversity of architectures in open-
weight models, including dense and mixture-of-
experts, we select seven widely used models:Llama-3 series (Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Llama-
3-70B-Instruct) (MetaAI, 2024), Llama-2 series
(Llama-2-7B-Chat, Llama-2-13B-Chat, and Llama-
2-70B-Chat) (Touvron et al., 2023), and Mistral
series (Mistral-7B-Instruct (MistralAI, 2023a) and
Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct (MistralAI, 2023b)).
4.2 Evaluation Settings
In our experiments, we tailor configurations to the
specific model types to ensure reproducible and
consistent results.
Proprietary models. We utilize their respective
APIs to generate outputs. To guarantee repro-
ducibility, we set the temperature to 0.0and main-
tain the original settings for all other parameters.
Open-weight models. We use the vLLM (Kwon
et al., 2023) library for building inference environ-
ment. All experiments were conducted using four
NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada 48G GPUs. Similar to the
proprietary models, we set the temperature to 0.0
and maintained other default settings.
4.3 Main Results
As shown in Table 2, we report an analysis of differ-
ent LLMs across various scenarios: missing neces-
sary tools (MNT), potential tools (PT), and limited
functionality tools (LFT). The evaluation metrics
encompass different diagnostic levels, including
EM in solvability detection (L1-EM), PR in solu-
tion planning (L2-PR), and PR and MS in missing
tools analysis (L3-PR and L3-MS). By computing
the average score across all samples, we include an
overall score ranging from 0to1.0. All scores are
reported in percentage in this paper.
In the overall assessment, Gemini-1.5-Pro scores
45.3, outperforming all competitors. It surpasses
other proprietary models, notably achieving a
22.4%performance improvement over the GPT-
4o. Among open-source models, the Llama-3-70B
exhibits the best performance. However, compared
to proprietary models, it only performs comparablyTable 2: The ToolBH leaderboard with 14LLMs, with the best bolded and the second best scores underlined .

to GPT-3.5-Turbo. This indicates a gap between
open-weight and proprietary models in our bench-
marks, highlighting its challenging evaluation.
In evaluation depth, all models face challenges
in the L3 (missing-tool analysis) task. In LFT sce-
narios, models such as Gemini-1.5-Pro, GPT-4o,
and GPT-4-Turbo exhibit declining performance
with increasing evaluation levels. Specifically, GPT-
4-0613 and GPT-4-Turbo scored 0.0in the L3-MS
task, and they were unable to identify any function-
alities of missing tools. This challenge likely stems
from the L3’s demand for complex reasoning and
analytical processes. The extensive generation of
intermediate text might contribute to “solvability
hallucination” and “long-text forgetting”, as further
discussed in Sec. 5.2. In addition, we observe some
unexpected results, such as in the MNT and PT
scenarios where the performance of Gemini-1.0-
Pro in the L3 task greatly surpasses that in the L1
and L2 tasks. This discrepancy may stem from the
minimal self-analysis required in L1 and L2, which
leads to shorter model outputs focused on basic
comprehension and planning skills. The training
data of Gemini-1.0-Pro might need to have such a
data structure. Conversely, L3 demands tool anal-
ysis, often resulting in extensive reasoning steps.
Given their training samples over 32k, Gemini se-
ries models present robust performance in the L3
task. Meanwhile, the minor difference between the
L2 and L3 scores for the Gemini models compared
to the GPT-4 suggests that the latter shows greater
consistency in contextual reasoning in unsolvable
scenarios Appendix E.4.In evaluation breadth, all models face extra chal-
lenges in the LFT (limited functionality tools)
scenario. In LFT scenarios, open-weight mod-
els show superior L1-EM performance compared
to MNT and PT. This trend is observed in both
Gemini-1.0-Pro and GPT-3.5-Turbo. However, the
L1 task solely provides a general evaluation, high-
lighting the need for deeper evaluations to iden-
tify underlying causes. In PT scenarios, there is a
notable decline in L1-EM and L2-PR scores com-
pared to MNT. The potential tools in a user query
can confuse the model’s assessment of the solv-
ability of the task. For example, GPT-4o is prone
to errors induced by context and may utilize un-
listed tools (Further analysis in Appendix E.1).
This increases the risk of hazardous operations in
real-world applications. In LFT scenarios, the de-
cline in L2-PR and L3 scores relative to L1-EM
is more pronounced compared to MNT and PT.
This discrepancy may be due to models misjudging
the solvability of tasks when necessary tools are
present but restricted in their functionality.
The performance of LLMs does not solely de-
pend on the number of parameters; the training
data and the response strategy may also play
critical roles. For instance, despite having a simi-
lar number of parameters as Llama-3-70B, Llama-
2-70B performs worse across all tasks. Moreover,
Llama-3-8B, with only 8B parameters, scores 0.2
points higher than Llama-2-70B in the overall score.
Several factors could explain these differences,
such as the training token count: 15T for the Llama-
3 series compared to just 2T for Llama-2. Addition-
ally, the context window in the pre-training phasefor Llama-3 is twice as large as that of Llama-2,
reaching 8k tokens. Therefore, the quantity and
quality of training data greatly influence model
performance. We discuss the influence of different
response strategies in Appendix E.2, and how it
influenced scores in Appendix D.1. In general, the
performance of the open-weight model declined
with length when it employed overly enthusias-
tic preference learning, resulting in excessively
long responses. Conversely, the proprietary model
demonstrated increased performance with length,
indicating enhanced consistency in reasoning over
long texts. Beyond parameter count, the commu-
nity should also focus on data quality, response
strategy, and long-context reasoning consistency.
5 Discussion
5.1 Model Performance: A Depth and
Breadth Perspective
As shown in Fig. 3, we compare the overall perfor-
mance of the top 3models across two dimensions
we designed: depth and breadth.
In-depth. GPT-4-0613 and GPT-4o perform well
in L1 ( 52.1and44.8, respectively) but show signif-
icantly drop in L2 and L3, indicating weaknesses
in solution planning and tool analysis. Gemini-
1.5-Pro exhibited a unique trend, excelling in L1
(62.6), decreasing in L2 ( 55.5), and rebounding in
L3 (57.9). This pattern indicates strengths in over-
all evaluation and tool analysis but challenges in
solution planning.
In-breadth. All models excelled in the MNT sce-
nario ( 40.0-55.0), but scores fell in the PT and LFT
scenarios (down to 20.0-30.0), reflecting a general
difficulty adapting to varying tool constraints.
5.2 Error Analysis
As shown in Fig. 4, we conduct a comprehensive
error analysis covering various diagnostic tasks and
scenarios. Based on this analysis, we summarize
the identified errors into five types as follows:
Non-existent tools. LLMs often predict tools not in
the provided tool list, showing a failure to identify
available tools and attempting to use non-existent
ones. This error is frequent in Level-2 tasks and
LFT scenario of open-weight models but rare in
proprietary models.
Wrong tools. LLMs use tools not required for the
task, indicating a misunderstanding of task require-
ments or tools’ functionality. This error is shown in
all models, especially in Level-3 tasks and LFT sce-

Solvability hallucination. LLMs often fail to iden-
tify that a task or subtask is unsolvable, indicating
an underestimation of task complexity. This is the
most common error, particularly in Level-3 tasks.
Wrong “UnsolvableQuery” index. LLMs cor-
rectly predict that some tasks or subtasks are un-
solvable but misidentify which specific subtasks
are unsolvable. This error occurs less frequently
but is present in all models and stages, indicating a
bias in understanding complex tasks.Table 3: Results for original solvable and unsolvable

Wrong tool reasoning. LLMs do not use tools in
the correct sequence, highlighting issues in task
logic. This error is more prevalent in proprietary
models than in open-weight models. This is be-
cause open-weight models tend to show more “solv-
ability hallucination” errors while proprietary mod-
els can detect more unsolvable cases. Consequently,
they cannot perform subsequent tasks, resulting in
a smaller number and percentage of errors relative
to proprietary models.
Additionally, the outcomes are compared with
three akin benchmarks, as delineated in Ap-
pendix B.
5.3 Solvable Tasks Versus Corresponding
Unsolvable Tasks
During our iterative annotation process described
in Sec. 3.4, we emphasize fairness and objectivity
in data curation and implement thorough manual
curation and refinement throughout the synthesis
process. To evaluate potential biases introduced
by the data generation process using proprietary
models, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
across proprietary and open-weight models on gen-
erated solvable problems and their corresponding
unsolvable counterparts, which is human-crafted.
As shown in Table 3, there are minimal perfor-
mance discrepancies between LLMs under solvable
tasks. Despite the inherent capability gaps between
open-weight and proprietary models, open-weight
models achieve 91.1%of the performance of pro-
prietary models.
This indicates that biases in data generated by
proprietary models are effectively minimized fol-
lowing human intervention. However, the perfor-
mance disparity becomes substantially larger when
assessing unsolvable tasks. Open-weight modelscan only achieve 39.4%of the performance when
compared to proprietary models. This discrepancy
is particularly noteworthy given that recent bench-
marks assume a strong premise: users will pro-
vide a complete list of tools, each accompanied by
detailed explanations (Ma et al., 2024; Qin et al.,
2023; Zhuang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). This
highlights the importance of unsolvable tests in
comparing model performance within tool-using
scenarios.
6 Conclusions
This paper introduces the ToolBH benchmark for
diagnosing hallucinations in tool-augmented LLMs.
Specifically, we evaluate hallucination from the
perspective of depth (multi-level evaluation frame-
work) and breadth (three scenarios to induce hallu-
cinations). Our results indicate that LLMs are prone
to hallucinations even in straightforward tool-using
tasks under unsolvable conditions. The impact of
the quantity and quality of the training data, re-
sponse strategy, and long-context reasoning con-
sistency on the performance should be addressed.
Error analysis reveals that LLMs primarily strug-
gle with solvability hallucination, characterized by
their inability to comprehend user queries and ac-
curately interpret the tools and their functions. This
often leads these models to mistakenly conclude
that they can solve tasks. Our ToolBH marks a
pivotal advancement in diagnosing hallucinations,
providing resources for exploring the real-world
performance of tool-augmented LLMs.
Limitations
Our analysis may need to be more comprehensive
as it does not include a broader range of open-
source LLMs, such as cross-linguistic models. The
focus is solely on dense architectures and mixture-
of-experts, considering only these structures and
varying parameter sizes known to influence per-
formance. Additionally, the limited scope of only
seven models could introduce bias into our findings.
To mitigate these limitations, we will open-source
all data and methods to assist users and develop-
ers by simplifying the evaluation process.
In our tool design, we only reference practices
similar to the methods in MetaTool (Huang et al.,
2023), where only tool names are provided with-
out additional details such as API parameters. This
approach could lead to discrepancies between our
evaluation benchmarks and real-world applications.Fortunately, as is inherent to its design, our frame-
work is scalable and, therefore, capable of incorpo-
rating a broader range of tools, including those that
use APIs with parameters. This flexibility allows
the community to effortlessly swap tools based on
our guidelines and conduct more comprehensive
analyses of model performance.
Ethical Considerations
As our data is derived from synthetic sources, it is
possible that certain ethical biases may be present.
Manual interventions have been incorporated into
the filtering process to mitigate potential ethical
bias. However, it should be acknowledged that this
does not guarantee the complete elimination of
these biases. Furthermore, since all the members
of our annotation team are from the same coun-
try, there may be an inherent regional characteri-
zation that hinders the effective filtering of biases
prevalent in other regions. Consequently, it is rec-
ommended that additional bias mitigation strate-
gies be employed, such as the ethical alignment
techniques (Yu et al., 2023), diverse annotation
panel (Shi et al., 2024a) or custom rules, before
utilizing the aforementioned data.

A Details of Benchmark Curation
A.1 Design Considerations of the Multi-level
Evaluation Methods
In this section, we present our design considera-
tions from the perspective of depth in hallucina-
tions Sec. 3.2.
InLevel-1 (Solvability Detection) , the task is to
determine whether a given user query can be solved
using the available tools from a macro perspective.
It effectively filters out tasks that require further
analysis, identifying those deemed unsolvable from
a macro-level judgment, and allows the system to
focus on tasks that might have been incorrectly
evaluated at this level.
InLevel-2 (Solution Planning) , the purpose is
to refine the solution by determining at which step
the task becomes problematic.
Once Level-1 has been evaluated from a macro
perspective, a more detailed analysis will be con-
ducted to identify the specific steps involved in
hallucination during the task. Consequently, the
task requirement is divided into several sub-goals
from the perspective of task decomposition. With
this setup, a detailed breakdown of the steps re-
quired to solve the task is provided, enabling the
identification of which steps involve the correct use
of the tool and which are incorrect. This lays the
groundwork for a more in-depth analysis.
InLevel-3 (Missing-Tool Analysis) , when a sub-
goal is identified as unsolvable in Level-2, under-
standing why the current tools fail to achieve this
sub-goal is crucial. Therefore, the task requires
the model to describe the functions of the missing
tools, thus revealing specific deficiencies. The anal-
ysis of missing tools allows for further analysis of
the model’s understanding of tool characteristics,
such as tool functionality. Furthermore, such an
analysis can benefit real-world scenarios, assisting
developers in refining the toolset.
In summary, we present a hierarchical approach
to diagnosing model hallucinations based on the
model’s progressive understanding of user queries
and available toolsets. Our methodology comprises
three distinct levels of analysis: At Level-1, the
model conducts a marco assessment of the infor-
mation provided by the user query. Proceeding to
Level-2, the model decomposes the overarching
objective into multiple sub-goals and attempts to
address them using provided tools. Finally, at Level-3, the model performs an in-depth analysis of each
tool’s characteristics, such as functionality, con-
cerning each sub-goal. This three-tiered approach
offers a perspective on hallucination analysis that
spans different depths of comprehension. It enables
a comprehensive examination of unsolvable tasks
involving tool use, progressing from macro to mi-
cro levels and general to specific details. This ana-
lytical framework facilitates a profound understand-
ing of hallucinations in LLMs and potentially pro-
vides a valuable direction for future research aimed
at mitigating the occurrence of such phenomena.
A.2 Filtering Criteria
In Sec. 3.4, we mentioned several filtering meth-
ods in (3) Filtering . We define the corresponding
criteria as follow.
Semantic similarity check. We employ embed-
ding models all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and compute the
semantic similarity between each synthetic sample
and the seed sample. We exclude samples with task
similarity and tool similarity scores greater than 0.8
to avoid redundancy and ensure dataset diversity.
Filtering with python code. In the subtasks except
for “Single-step”, a simple matching algorithm is
employed to eliminate ambiguous tasks and retain
only samples with clearly itemized task require-
ments. Concurrently, it is verified that all tools men-
tioned in the ground truth solutions are included in
the provided list of tools. Furthermore, responses
are tailored to align with the specific requirements
of different subtasks based on their characteristics.
For instance, the “Iterative” task necessitates re-
peated consecutive use of the same tool.
Manual review process. Samples that are unclear
in expression, contain logical fallacies, or have poor
argumentation between the sub-goal description
and the tool used are removed. Furthermore, po-
tential ethical biases, including but not limited to
gender and racial biases, are eliminated from the
dataset.
A.3 Generation Prompts
In Sec. 3.3, we provide a comprehensive descrip-
tion of the hallucination-inducing tasks within our
benchmark. We designed corresponding prompts
based on the characteristics of subtasks in various
scenarios. The specific content of these prompts
can be found from Fig. 9 to Fig. 15.A.4 Evaluation Prompts
In Sec. 3.2, we present a detailed analysis of the
hallucination phenomenon from the perspective of
depth. we set the temperature to 0.0and maintained
other default settings (Shi et al., 2024b). Specially,
we conduct a series of processing operations on the
model output, as outlined below.
The different levels of evaluation prompts are
manually constructed by wrapping both the task
description section and the provided tools section
in particular XML elements. The task description
is marked with the tags <task> and </task> and the
provided tools with the tags <provided_tools> and
</provided_tools>, respectively. Furthermore, we
require that LLMs use the tags <answer> and </an-
swer> to enclose the answer part. We require that
redundancies be avoided in the output to minimize
the tendency of LLMs to produce long answers or
detailed explanations.
We provided a corresponding prompt and exam-
ple for each level of the task from Fig. 16 to Fig. 18.
In Level-1, we focus on determining the solvability
of the task; Level-2 requires the model to split and
prioritize subtasks based on available tools; Level-
3 further demands the model to analyze tool us-
age and identify missing tool functionalities. These
prompts are designed to progressively increase task
complexity, comprehensively assessing the halluci-
nation state within tool-augmented LLM scenarios.

B Comparisons with Existing
Benchmarks
In this section, we present a comprehensive compar-
ison with existing, widely-used tool-based bench-
marks, providing a detailed analysis of our findings.
Our benchmark presents a greater challenge com-
pared to previous tool-based benchmarks. In the
AgentBoard for tool-related Tool-Query task(Ma
et al., 2024), 8out of 13evaluated models scored
between 60.0and85.1points. However, the perfor-
mance disparity among these models on our bench-
mark is notably significant. For instance, the per-
formance difference between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-
Turbo is 18.4%. Similarly, StableToolBench (Guo
et al., 2024) showed a modest disparity among top-
performing models, with a difference of 11.3%be-tween GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. This gap widens to
57.7%on our ToolBH benchmark.
This reflects our multi-level assessment’s ability
to discern nuanced differences in LLM capabilities,
providing a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs’
proficiency across similar tasks.
Furthermore, our benchmark enhances the er-
ror analysis granularity compared to MetaTool’s
reliability task. MetaTool (Huang et al., 2023) con-
ducted reliability tests requiring the output of the
correct tool or “None” if no appropriate tool exists,
which is similar to our Level-1 task. Their tasks
generally involved a single sentence with a single
requirement and only required the output of one
tool. Conversely, our benchmark introduces com-
plex, multi-layered scenarios that pose a broader
range of challenges. For example, while GPT-3.5
achieved a score of 50.35on MetaTool’s reliability
task, it managed only an average score of 18on our
Level-1 task.
Moreover, MetaTool did not fully explore the
diversity of scenarios that models may encounter,
leading to their conclusion that LLMs often pro-
duce irrelevant tool responses (corresponding to
our “Wrong Tools” error type). In our benchmark,
through analysis at multi-level tasks, reveals that
while “Wrong Tools” is a common error type for
these models, the core issue lies in their inability to
discern task solvability, manifesting as “Solvability
Hallucination”.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a more
sophisticated multi-level evaluation and incorpo-
rates a wider array of task scenarios, enabling a
more nuanced analysis of hallucinations. These en-
hancements allow for a detailed investigation into
the reasons behind these inaccuracies, as discussed
in Sec. 5.2. This comprehensive approach aids the
community in gaining a deeper understanding of
why such hallucinations occur, improving model
evaluation methodologies and addressing gaps in
current benchmarking practices.

C.2 Different Embedding Models in Level-3
Matching Score
In Level-3, the cosine similarity between tools
is calculated using embedding models. There-
fore, we test the L3-MS scores of these mod-
els to assess the impact of different embed-
ding models on MS score computation. As pre-
sented in Table 4, we consider the proprietary
embedding model text-embedding-0041(re-
ferred to as Gemini) and the open-weight em-
bedding model all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (referred to
as MiniLM). The details of the two embedding
models are listed.
•text-embedding-004 :
–Input: Text
–Output: Text embeddings
–Input token limit: 2,048
–Output dimension size: 768
–Latest update: April 2024
•all-MiniLM-L6-v2 :
–Input: Text
–Output: Text embeddings
–Input token limit: 512
–Output dimension size: 384
In result, the negligible variance in the L3-MS
scores across different embedding models presents
the robustness of our task and metric frameworks.
Consequently, we select the all-MiniLM-L6-v2
model as default embedding model.

Performance?

response lengths ( X) and corresponding perfor-
mance ( Y) at different levels. After standardizing
the data, we created scatter plots with regression
lines to depict the trends between response length
and scores visually. This approach allows us to intu-
itively observe positive, negative, or no correlation
between length and performance scores.
D.1.1 Open-weight Models: Negative
Correlation with Response Length
For the open-weight models, the regression lines
for all levels (L1 to L3) and all scenarios (MNT,
PT, LFT) trend downward. This indicates that the
overall performance scores tend to decrease as the
response length increases.
We observe that open-weight models often gener-
ate longer responses for task planning, which may
include excessive redundant information and unnec-
essary conversational elements. This phenomenon
might obscure critical steps and tool choices with ir-
relevant information, negatively impacting task ac-
curacy and overall scores. One reason is that, influ-
enced by the format of training data and preferred
response strategy, the generation of responses with
conversational characteristics may be prioritized,
resulting in responses filled with irrelevant explana-
tions and extensions. This tendency towards over-
explanation and verbosity generally leads to poorer
performance under task-oriented evaluation criteria.
To optimize this, one possible solution is to intro-
duce more task-oriented examples during training
to reduce the emphasis on generating conversa-
tional features and encourage the generation of
concise, relevant task plans. Moreover, it is imper-1.5

maintain information consistency and logical co-
herence in complex tasks involving long-text.
D.1.2 Proprietary Models: Positive
Correlation with Response Length
For proprietary models, all scenarios and levels ex-
hibit regression lines that are either flat or trend
upward, with the exception of a slight downward
trend observed in L3-MS for MNT and PT. This
suggests that, in contrast to open-weight models,
longer response lengths in proprietary models are
associated with higher performance scores. In ad-
dition, proprietary models demonstrate superior
performance in adhering to the task instructions
provided. As illustrated in Fig. 6 (c), all proprietary
models have the same token length, suggesting that
they are all capable of following the instructions
and avoiding the generation of redundant outputs.
Proprietary models exhibit an enhanced aptitude
for maintaining contextual consistency in extended
responses, thereby furnishing comprehensive and
pertinent information. This capability enables these
models to perform well in complex tasks and long-
text reasoning, where longer responses improve
task execution coherence and accuracy, rather than
introducing redundancy. Proprietary models appear
to prioritize long-text reasoning and contextual pro-
cessing during the data designing and model train-
ing phases. This enables them to generate responses
that better meet task requirements, ensuring that
each step and tool selection is accompanied by de-
tailed explanations and reasoning, thus improving
task performance.
In our L3-MS results, proprietary models tasked
with describing the functions of absent tools tend to
lose focus during long responses. This suggests that
these models are more prone to hallucinations when
required to introduce new or missing elements, as
opposed to merely completing existing informa-
tion. Thus, despite their demonstrated proficiency
with long texts, these models struggle to maintain
performance quality in scenarios that demand the
introduction of novel components.
D.2 Additional Error Analysis for LLMs
As illustrated in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, we provide ad-
ditional error analysis for the L2-PR and L3-PR
evaluations of open-weight and proprietary models,
respectively. The distribution of these errors aligns
with the analyses presented in Sec. 5.2. By extend-
ing our examination to these specific contexts, weaim to enrich the community’s understanding of the
diverse types of hallucinatory phenomena encoun-
tered in tool-using tasks. This detailed error distri-
bution is expected to aid researchers in developing
targeted optimizations to enhance the usability of
tool-augmented LLMs.
E Case Study
E.1 Potential Tools Failure
Considering textually fictionalized environments in
prompts, LLMs erroneously assume that specific
tools are available when explicitly informed that
they are not. For example, in Linux environment,
LLMs might try to use the unprovided tools such
as “rm” and “ufw”.
As illustrated in Table 5, the latest GPT-4o model
is susceptible to the hallucination of potential tools.
Furthermore, we provide several anonymous chats
for GPT-4o: https://chatgpt.com/share/
83aa37e7-d87d-4fbd-9307-1f45cf29212d ,
and GPT-4: https://chatgpt.com/share/
c11566af-4410-42a3-a84d-939a445e228a .
A possible explanation for this phenomenon lies
in the training data, which likely includes exten-
sive information about operating systems and their
associated tools. When the model is prompted to
operate within the context of an operating system,
it may inadvertently activate neural pathways asso-
ciated with a broad range of system tools. This ac-
tivation in LLMs might lead to the erroneously out-
putting commands for restricted tools (e.g., “ufw”)
that are typically part of the operating system de-
spite explicit instructions to use only a provided
toolset. This behavior suggests a challenge in main-
taining strict adherence to the given constraints
while leveraging its comprehensive knowledge of
operating system environments.
E.2 Different Response Strategies
As observed in Sec. 5.2,“Solvability Hallucinations”
are significantly more prevalent in L3 than in L2,
regardless of whether the model is proprietary or
open-weight. This is attributed to the additional
missing-tool analysis in L3, which may lead the
model to generate its content while disregarding
certain inherent limitations associated with the task
and tool. Similarly, we endeavor to extend this
conjecture to different models for further analy-
sis. In our experiments, we observe that even when
a prompt explicitly requests that the model refrain
from producing any output other than what is re-Level-2

ily conversational enthusiasm and generate replies
with highly redundant content. This phenomenon
is likely attributable to both the format of the train-
ing data and the response preferences. We present
several examples from Table 6 to Table 8. Since
we require the use of the tags <answer> and </an-
swer> to delineate the answer part in the prompt, it
is convenient for us to match answers to this class
of "over-enthusiastic" models. However, we dis-
cover that models with more redundant responses
were less accurate than models that adhered to the
construct of replying only to the answer part, as
discussed in Appendix D.1, and this phenomenon
was independent of the model parameter size. For
example, we observe that Llama-2 responses exhib-
ited a greater level of enthusiasm than Llama-3. For
similar parameters, Llama-3 demonstrates a signifi-
cant performance advantage over Llama-2; notably,
the Llama-3-8B model even surpasses the Llama-
2-70B in overall score. This phenomenon suggests
that in tool-augmented LLM, the setting of training
data and the construction of response preference-
aligned data have an equally non-negligible impact
on task performance.

We observed that LLMs sometimes fail to initially
identify an unsolvable problem correctly but can
be guided to the correct answer with additional
human prompts. As illustrated in Table 5, GPT-
4 provides the correct answer after an additional
round of prompt. This indicates that LLMs have
the capability to generate correct responses, pro-
vided they receive appropriate prompts. However,
as shown in Table 5, GPT-4o still struggle with hal-
lucinations. Considering that additional prompts
generally exist in multi-turn dialogue data, we hy-
pothesize that the specific aspects of the training
data and multi-turn dialogue training strategies may
contribute to this issue.
E.4 Consistency in Contextual Reasoning
As shown in Table 9, the results indicate that the
Gemini-1.5-Pro exhibits greater consistency in self-
contextual reasoning in unsolvable scenarios be-
tween Level-2 and Level-3, compared to the GPT-
4o. Specifically, at Level-2, Gemini-1.5-Pro’s re-
sponses show that the second task requirement
is unsolvable and outputs an “UnsolvableQuery”.
In the same task at Level-3, Gemini-1.5-Pro’s re-
sponse continues to predict an “UnsolvableQuery”as the planned tool for subgoal 2. In contrast, while
GPT-4o’s response successfully predicts an “Un-
solvableQuery” at Level-2, at Level-3, it bypassed
the originally unsolvable subgoal and proceeded
directly with subsequent task planning. Therefore,
it can be hypothesized that the Gemini-1.5-Pro pos-
sesses a better understanding of the implications
of “UnsolvableQuery” and the actual solvability
of tasks, and this understanding is not affected
by changes in task demands or the context of the
model’s self-reasoning. Conversely, when detailed
task planning is conducted concurrently with the
execution of tasks, GPT-4o is more likely to be
influenced by the context content it reasons out,
leading to deviations in subsequent task planning
from the prescribed task requirements.Table 5: Continual instructions analysis. In this case, GPT-4 successfully provides the correct answer when given
further prompts, whereas the newer model, GPT-4o, fails to do so.

Task Description:
You need to go ahead and generate samples of tool usage with as much diversity as possible, based on the current
dimension, the requirements requirements of the task, and the sample references provided.
Current dimension:
Single-step tool using: the case where the output tool is directly requested in single-step reasoning
Task Requirement:
- Generate new samples with as much diversity as possible in terms of user query and available tools.
- Use "// Raw Input //" and "// Raw Output //" to label the inputs and outputs of the samples.
- The sample needs to consider a real-life scenario as much as possible. Multiple tools need to be provided in the raw
input, and in the current dimension, the raw output uses only one tool to fulfill the user’s query in the planning phase,
which corresponds to Single-step tool using.
At build time, you need to:
First give a copy of the overall task, which usually has only a single requirement. In the list of available tools, make sure
to provide tools that can fulfill this requirement, while adding a small number of tools that do not directly contribute to
the task to ensure task complexity and tool diversity. Finally, complete the corresponding task planning process in the
output based on these requirements, keeping in mind that only one tool was used to accomplish the task.

Current dimension:
Multiple Appropriate Tools Dimension - Optimal Tool Selection
Task Requirement:
- Generate new samples taking into account as much as possible the diversity of user query and available tools. - First,
make sure that the task description is a goal that requires the use of multiple tools to accomplish, and provide the
corresponding tools in the list of available tools using numerical numbers.
- Use "// Raw Input //" and "// Raw output //" to label the inputs and outputs of the samples.
- The samples need to consider a realistic scenario as much as possible. Multiple tools need to be available in the list of
available tools in the raw input. Note that there will be multiple suitable tools that all take on the same or very similar
functions in the current dimension, e.g., for a language detection task, tool A may have a higher recognition rate for
some minor languages, while tool B is more accurate on common languages. One needs to be weighed against the
specific needs of the task (whether comprehensiveness is more important or accuracy for a particular language is more
important); for a text sentiment analysis task, tool C can provide simple keyword-based sentiment analysis, while tool D
is capable of deeper sentiment understanding and contextual analysis. In this case, if the user needs a quick and shallow
analysis, tool C may be preferred; if deeper sentiment understanding is needed, tool D may be preferred. One needs to
choose the right tool based on the specific situation, e.g., the complexity of the text and the detailed needs of the user;
and so on.
At build time, you need to:
First give a list of overall tasks and then express specific task requirements separately. In the list of available tools, make
sure to provide tools that can fulfill these requirements, while adding a small number of tools that do not directly help
the task to ensure the complexity of the task and the diversity of tools. At the same time, in the current dimension, you
need to build multiple tools with the same functionality but different focuses, and emphasize a particular focus in the
task description to achieve the effect of selecting the most effective tool. Finally, according to these requirements, com-
plete the corresponding task planning process in the output, keeping in mind that each step corresponds to a different tool.

3. Tools that are not in <provided_tools> cannot be used
4. Use <answer> and </answer> to wrap the entire answer
The format for task planning can be seen in the following example:
<answer>Subgoal 1: [description] Planned tool: [tool name]
Subgoal 2: [description ] Planned tool: [tool name]
...
Subgoal t: [description] Planned tool: [tool name]</answer> nState the relationship between the subgoal and the
requirement in the [description] section, provide the tool name in the [tool name] section, and don’t provide any
description or explanation in the [tool name] section.
If there is a limit to the number of tools that can be used in a <task>, the next step after the limit is reached calls
UnsolvableQuery to terminate the task. For example, to limit the number of tools to t or less:
<answer>Subgoal 1: [description] Planned tool: [tool name]
...
Subgoal t: [description] Planned tool: [tool name]
Subgoal t+1: [Task requires number of tools within t] Planned tool: UnsovlableQuery</answer>
Now, let’s start scheduling the current task, using <answer> to mark the start of the task and </answer>
mark the end of the task.
<task>
[task_description]
</task>
<provided_tools>
[provided_tool_list]
</provided_tools>
