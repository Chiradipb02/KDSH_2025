Abstract
We posit that large language models (LLMs)
should be capable of expressing their intrinsic
uncertainty in natural language. For example,
if the LLM is equally likely to output two con-
tradicting answers to the same question, then
its generated response should reflect this un-
certainty by hedging its answer (e.g., “ I’m not
sure, but I think... ”). We formalize faithful re-
sponse uncertainty based on the gap between
the model’s intrinsic confidence in the asser-
tions it makes and the decisiveness by which
they are conveyed. This example-level metric
reliably indicates whether the model reflects
its uncertainty, as it penalizes both excessive
and insufficient hedging. We evaluate a vari-
ety of aligned LLMs at faithfully communicat-
ing uncertainty on several knowledge-intensive
question answering tasks. Our results provide
strong evidence that modern LLMs are poor at
faithfully conveying their uncertainty, and that
better alignment is necessary to improve their
trustworthiness.
1 Introduction
Despite their unprecedented capabilities, large lan-
guage models (LLMs) often output erroneous infor-
mation (Ji et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2021; Mallen et al.,
2022; Kandpal et al., 2023). Moreover, LLMs typi-
cally communicate such inaccurate information in
afluent, decisive, and persuasive manner, which
may lead users to overly rely on their false output
(Buçinca et al., 2021; Passi and V orvoreanu, 2022).
We argue that a possible pathway for improving
LLM trustworthiness is to have the model com-
municate its uncertainty in words, as part of its
generated response (Baan et al., 2023; Vasconce-
los et al., 2023). Expressing uncertainty in natural
language has several benefits over using numerical
estimates. First, language provides a rich space,
which can be useful to convey the source of the
model’s uncertainty. Second, it is generally per-
ceived as more intuitive to humans (Zimmer, 1983;

Hedging Assertion 
Figure 1: We define faithful response uncertainty
based on the gap between the decisiveness ( blue) of
the response and the model’s intrinsic confidence in
it (hatched orange ). We empirically show: (1)with
standard decoding, models answer decisively even in
the presence of uncertainty (top left); (2)when prompted
to express uncertainty, generated hedges are not faithful
to the model’s intrinsic uncertainty (bottom left).
Wallsten et al., 1993; Windschitl and Wells, 1996).
Indeed, a recent user study by Kim et al. (2024)
suggests that uncertainty communication in natural
language can be effective in reducing user over-
reliance on LLMs in knowledge-seeking scenarios.
However, uncertainty expressions are only useful
when they faithfully reflect the model’s intrinsic un-
certainty . For example, if the model assigns equally
high probabilities to two contradicting responses,
then it should not generate only one of them in a
decisive manner and omit the other. We formalize
this through the notion of faithful response uncer-
tainty (§2), an example-level score that quantifies
the gap between the (linguistic) decisiveness in
which the model conveys its assertions and its in-
trinsic confidence in them ( Fig. 1). Our approach
differs significantly from prior work in that we aim
to align the decisiveness of the generated response
with the model’s intrinsic confidence, rather than
with external factuality verdicts (Kadavath et al.,
2022; Kuhn et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2022; Mielke
et al., 2022); see discussion in §B and additional
related work in §C.arXiv:2405.16908v2  [cs.CL]  26 Sep 2024Next (§3), we propose a concrete implementa-
tion for decisiveness and confidence scoring, us-
ing Gemini Ultra (Gemini-Team, 2023) as a judge,
which shows high correlation with human judge-
ment. Then (§4 and §5), we use our implementa-
tion to evaluate the faithfulness of leading LLMs
(Gemini family (Gemini-Team, 2023), GPT-3.5
and GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023)) on two ques-
tion answering (QA) datasets (Natural Questions
(Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and PopQA (Mallen
et al., 2022)), using greedy decoding with a stan-
dard QA prompt as well as a series of prompting
methods that encourage the expression of uncer-
tainty. We find that:
•With standard decoding, virtually all the mod-
els answer decisively, even in the presence of
significant intrinsic uncertainty.
•While prompting the model to express uncer-
tainty sometimes induces expressions of uncer-
tainty, these hedges are not well-aligned with the
model’s intrinsic uncertainty.
Taken together, our results suggest LLMs are inca-
pable of faithfully conveying their uncertainty in
natural language, hindering their trustworthiness.
2 Faithful Response Uncertainty
Our goal is to evaluate whether models can ex-
press uncertainty in words to faithfully reflect
their intrinsic uncertainty. To this end, we first
propose to consider the decisiveness with which
assertions in a response are expressed. Given
a query Qand a response Rgenerated by a
model M, we view Ras a sequence of asser-
tionsA(R) ={A1, ..., A n}, each expressed with
some level of decisiveness that is derived from
possible hedging expressions associated with it.1
For example, given the query “ Tell me about
Barack Obama ”, the response “ Barack Obama is
an American politician. I think he was born in
1961, but I’m not sure. ” contains two assertions:
A1=Barack Obama is an American politician ,
and A2= Barack Obama was born in 1961 .
While A1is conveyed decisively in the response,
A2is less decisive due to the hedging expressions
“I think ” and “ I’m not sure ”.
We consider a response Ras faithful to Mif
for every assertion A∈ A(R), the decisiveness in
1In principle, uncertainty can be expressed explicitly with
hedging expressions and implicitly (e.g., by specifying alterna-
tives, as in “ either xory”). We focus on explicit uncertainty.which Ais conveyed matches M’s intrinsic confi-
dence in A:
Definition 1 (Faithful Response Uncertainty)
For a query Qand a response Rgenerated by a
model M, the faithfulness of Rwith respect to
M’s intrinsic confidence is given by:
faithfulness M(R;Q)≡1−
1
|A(R)|X
A∈A(R)|dec(A;R,Q)−conf M(A)|
where dec(A;R,Q)∈[0,1]quantifies the deci-
siveness of the assertion AinRandconf M(A)∈
[0,1]quantifies the intrinsic uncertainty of Mre-
garding A.
Note that faithfulness (shorthand f) is in
[0,1], where a maximal value of 1is obtained when
every assertion’s decisiveness matches the model’s
intrinsic confidence. Lower faithfulness values are
obtained in cases of unnecessary hedging , that is,
expressing uncertainty in assertions that the model
is certain about, or lack of hedging , i.e., not ex-
pressing uncertainty in assertions the model is not
confident about. See examples in Fig. 1.
3 Measuring Decisiveness & Uncertainty
We now propose an implementation to the faithful-
ness score, focusing on the setting of short-form
question answering (QA), where Qis a factual
question (e.g., “ When was Barack Obama born? ”)
andRis typically a short answer with a single
(possibly hedged) assertion (e.g., “ August 1961 ”).
Quantifying Decisiveness Prior work quantified
the decisiveness of an assertion as a binary notion,
based on whether the assertion is accompanied by
a hedging expression or not (Mielke et al., 2022).
However, this captures only little of the expressivity
through which hedging expressions can convey un-
certainty. Recognizing that decisiveness is subjec-
tive in nature, we draw inspiration from definitions
of veridicality (Giannakidou, 1999; De Marneffe
et al., 2012) and propose the notion of perceived
decisiveness , which aims to be relativized to partic-
ular agents or perspectives. Formally, we define the
perceived decisiveness of an assertion A∈ A(R)
as the probability an agent would assign to Abeing
true judging purely based on R:
dec(A;R,Q) = Pr [ A is True |R,Q](1)Quantifying Uncertainty Following previous
work (Kuhn et al., 2023; Manakul et al., 2023; Tian
et al., 2023a), we quantify certainty via consistency .
Concretely, for a query Q(e.g., “ When was Barack
Obama born? ”) we quantify the uncertainty of a
generated assertion A(e.g., “ Barack Obama was
born in 1961 ”) by examining the consistency be-
tween this assertion and re-sampled answers to Q:
If the generated answers agree with A(e.g., “ 1961 ”,
“I think he was born in 1961 ”, or “ August 4, 1961. ”),
then we say Mis confident in A. Conversely, asser-
tions that contradict A(e.g., “ 1962 ” or “ Probably
1955 ”) indicate that M’s confidence in Ais lower.2
Formally, given a question Qand a generated re-
sponseRconsisting of a single assertion A, let
{R1, . . . ,Rk}be the set of sampled responses and
{A1, . . . , A k}the set of corresponding assertions
(i.e.,A(Ri) ={Ai}). We quantify the confidence
ofMinAas the fraction of sampled assertions
that contradict A:
conf M(A)≡1−1
kX
i1[Acontradicts Ai](2)
Implementation Details We implement the
above scores (Eq. 1, Eq. 2) by prompting a “judge”
LLM. For a given query Qand a generated re-
sponseR, we first extract the assertion AinRand
its decisiveness score using a few-shot prompt Pd
(see Tab. 5 in §D). Next, to quantify the model’s
intrinsic confidence, we sample k= 20 additional
answers for Qand extract their corresponding as-
sertions with Pd. Then, we use another few-shot
prompt Pc(see Tab. 6 in §D) to check for every
extracted assertion whether it contradicts A. In our
experiments, we use Gemini Ultra as the judge.
Correlation with Human Judgement We evalu-
ate the quality of our LLM-based scores, showing
that they correlate well with human judgment.
For decisiveness (Eq. 1), we randomly sample
100 model answers generated in our experiments
(§4) and rewrite each answer to include a hedging
expression (e.g., “ Highly likely ”). Then, we score
answers with our decisiveness prompt Pd. Fig. 2
shows for each hedging expression the mean deci-
siveness score versus the distribution of perceived
probabilities humans assigned to it (using survey
data from Fagen-Ulmschneider (2023)). Overall,
the LLM scores agree with the human evaluations.
2Notably, this formulation modestly deviates from Kuhn
et al. (2023), which we explain in §B.

For confidence (Eq. 2), we compare the confi-
dence scores for 100 randomly selected examples,
when calculated with our prompt Pcversus when
using labels written by the authors. We observe a
high correlation of 0.97 between the two scores.
4 Experimental Setting
We evaluate whether LLMs faithfully reflect their
uncertainty when answering questions.
Data We use knowledge-intensive QA datasets:
•PopQA (Mallen et al., 2022): Entity-centric
questions constructed based on WikiData (Vran-
deˇci´c and Krötzsch, 2014). PopQA covers many
tail entities , which LLMs struggle to capture
(Mallen et al., 2022; Kandpal et al., 2023; Yona
et al., 2024). Thus, faithful responses are ex-
pected to require expressing uncertainty.
•Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al.,
2019): Unlike PopQA, NQ is comprised of user
queries – hence it is more natural and better re-
flects the behavior of LLMs on real tasks.
As we focus on model uncertainty,3we exclude
ambiguous questions for which uncertainty can rise
due to data uncertainty (see details in §A).
Models We evaluate leading instruction-tuned
LLMs: OpenAI’s GPT (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-
turbo) (Achiam et al., 2023) and Google’s Gemini
(Nano, Pro and Ultra) (Gemini-Team, 2023).
Methods We obtain answers using multiple
prompts (see Tab. 2 for the specific instructions)
with greedy decoding:
•Vanilla : The LLM is instructed to answer the
question using a standard format Question:
{question}\nAnswer: .

Method Instruction
Vanilla Answer the following question us-
ing a succinct (at most one sen-
tence) and full answer.
Granularity Answer at a level of granular-
ity that matches your knowledge.
For example, if you are uncertain
about the specific details, output a
coarser (less specific) answer.
Uncertainty If you are uncertain about your an-
swer to the question, convey this
uncertainty linguistically by pre-
cisely hedging this answer.
Table 2: The specific instructions we use in the baselines
we evaluate (see §4).
•Granularity : We prepend Vanilla an additional
instruction to answer at an appropriate level of
granularity (Yona et al., 2024), which may induce
coarser and more-confident answers.
•Uncertainty : We prepend Vanilla an additional
instruction to express uncertainty (via hedging)
in cases of uncertainty.
•Uncertainty+ : A variant of Uncertainty with
few-shot demonstrations, which we manually
craft per model using questions from TriviaQA
(Joshi et al., 2017). We take m(Q,R)pairs
where Mis certain in RandRis decisive, and
mpairs where Mis uncertain in RandRis
not decisive. To account for model sensitivity
to the particular choice of demonstrations (Perez
et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Min et al., 2022),
we average the results over rrandom choices of
2mdemonstrations. We use m= 2 andr= 3,
which were sufficient to get consistent results.
Evaluation Given a model Mand a set of QA
pairs{(Qi,Ri)}n
i=1, the mean faithful generation
metric ( MFG) quantifies the expected faithfulness
of a single answer: MFG=1
nPn
i=1[fM(Ri;Qi)].
While MFGis a useful indicator, it heavily depends
on the distribution of confidence values the model
admits4, making it less useful for comparing dif-
4E.g., if dec≡1,MFGwill be the mean confidence value.ferent models. Therefore, we utilize a second met-
ric,conditional mean faithful generation ( cMFG ),
that additionally conditions on the confidence level:
Ei∼n
v∼U[0,1][fM(Ri;Qi)|conf M(Ri;Qi) =v]. In
practice, we bin the conf. scores to 10 equally-
sized bins and condition on each bin. Note that
cMFG essentially simulates MFGwith uniformly ran-
dom confidence scores, making it more appropriate
for comparing different models. Particularly, 0.5
is a baseline value for cMFG as it is obtained for
two simple decisiveness strategies that are indepen-
dent of the model’s confidence (always answering
decisively / at a random level of decisiveness).
In some cases, the models may punt the ques-
tion (i.e., not provide an answer to the question).
In these cases, neither accuracy, decisiveness nor
confidence can be computed. We therefore report
our scores (decisiveness, confidence and also faith-
fulness) as computed on the subset of examples for
which the model did not punt on; This is the selec-
tive prediction setting (El-Yaniv et al., 2010; Geif-
man and El-Yaniv, 2017), see e.g (Kamath et al.,
2020; Yoshikawa and Okazaki, 2023). In general,
the standard punting rate is low (1% for Vanilla)
but increases for the other methods (Granularity
3%, Uncertainty 10%, Uncertainty+ 8%).
5 Results
In Tab. 1 we report our faithfulness metric ( cMFG )
for all model-method-dataset combinations.
Without special instructions, models generate
decisive answers, even for uncertain answers
Considering the Vanilla baseline, all models per-
form poorly in terms of faithfulness with cMFG
close to 0.5 (Tab. 1, top row). This happens be-
cause all the models we tested did not generate
any expressions of uncertainty, despite having sig-
nificant intrinsic uncertainty in some cases. See
Fig. 3.

towards faithfully expressing uncertainty via
prompting. For the non-Vanilla baselines, thereGemNano GemPro GemUltra GPT-T-3.5 GPT-T-40.00.20.40.60.81.0

We observe that prompting models to express un-
certainty slightly reduces the mean decisiveness
(Fig. 5) by introducing hedging expressions (see
examples in Tab. 3 in the Appendix). Importantly,
however, the correlation between decisiveness and
confidence is weak; see Fig. 4. This suggests that
LLMs hedge when they are confident and answer
decisively despite uncertainty, explaining the still-
lowcMFG scores.
6 Conclusion
We formalize the desiderata that a language
model’s generated response should reflect its in-
trinsic uncertainty in natural language. We instanti-
ate this with a generic evaluation framework that
quantifies the mismatch between the linguistic deci-
siveness of the assertions made in the response and
theintrinsic uncertainty the model has in these as-
sertions. We quantify intrinsic uncertainty by con-
sidering the consistency of model answers across
multiple samples, but our framework is generic and
can be extended to other methods for quantifying

uncertainty, such as methods that depend on the
internal representations of the model.
We evaluate the abilities of modern LLMs at the
task of faithfully conveying their intrinsic uncer-
tainty. Taken together, our evaluations reveal that
modern LLMs perform poorly at this task, stressing
the need for better alignment techniques towards
ensuring trustworthiness in LLMs.Limitations
Determining the “appropriate” way for language
models to convey uncertainty in natural language
is a complex and multi-faceted question, with deep
roots in computational linguistics (see §C). To sim-
plify our evaluation, we focused on one relatively
simple case for conveying uncertainty: explicitly
conveying aleatoric uncertainty (or “model uncer-
tainty”) in knowledge-intensive QA tasks using
hedging expressions. Technically, this was facil-
itated by evaluating on non-ambiguous questions
(namely, questions that have a single correct an-
swer). For Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al.,
2019) we relied on prior work by Min et al. (2020)
that identified its non-ambiguous subset, but for
PopQA (Mallen et al., 2022) we relied on heuris-
tics (such as choosing a subset of relations and
keeping only questions with a single correct an-
swer in the dataset), which may not be perfect. On
a more conceptual level, the fact that we show over-
whelmingly negative results even for this simple
setting serves to highlight what is, in our opinion, a
significant limitation of modern LMs. As LMs im-
prove at faithfully conveying uncertainty is simple
settings, exploring the intricacies involved with ex-
pressing uncertainty in more generic settings (data
uncertainty, implicitly vs explicitly, etc) will be-
come more important.
We conclude with a discussion of two aspects re-
garding our evaluations, in which we demonstrated
that the ability to steer modern language models
towards faithfully conveying their uncertainty via
prompting is limited. First, since we show an over-
whelmingly negative result regarding the limitation
of existing LLMs, we chose to focus on the best-
performing model families (Gemini (Gemini-Team,
2023) and GPT (Achiam et al., 2023)). As such,
our evaluation uses closed models (i.e., models that
are available via a public API, but whose weights
are proprietary). Second, the methods we tested
relied on zero-shot and few-shot prompts. Concur-
rently to our work, Agarwal et al. (2024); Bertsch
et al. (2024) introduced the many-shot regime for
prompting models with extremely long context win-
dows, showing promising results. Understanding
whether this creates a fundamental difference in the
ability of language models to faithfully convey un-
certainty is another interesting direction for future
work.Acknowledgements

Data Pre-processing. We keep the relations
[’director’, ’screenwriter’, ’producer’, ’author’,
’place of birth’, ’occupation’] and remove short en-
tities (less than 2 characters). We also sub-sample
PopQA so that it’s at the same size of AmbigNQ
(932 examples).
Implementing Decisiveness. As mentioned in
§3, we implement our decisiveness score (Eqn. 1)
with a few-shot prompt Pdin which the LLM is
instructed to extract the assertion and a score be-
tween 0.0and1.0(see Tab. 5 in §D), judging purely
based off of the provided response. This is aligned
with the output of the confidence score (which is
naturally a number on [0,1), and gives rise to a
numeric faithfulness score. We also explored ob-
taining the numeric decisiveness score by scoring
the probability of a positive answer to the question
Is this statement decisive? (similar to P(True) in
(Kadavath et al., 2022)), but this did not work as
well, and also has the disadvantage of requiring ac-
cess to the probability of generated tokens, which
is not always available in public-facing APIs.
Prompts. The prompts we use for decisiveness
and confidence scoring can be found in Tab. 5 and
6, respectively.
Crafting Model-specific Demonstrations for
Communicating Uncertainty. Recall that Un-
certainty+ is a variant of Uncertainty that in-
cludes few-shot demonstrations of the target be-
havior (see §4). We now detail precisely how we
obtained these demonstrations. For a model M,
we used Vanilla to obtain predictions for Trivi-
aQA questions, and evaluated the model’s intrinsic
uncertainty in these answers using the approach
described in §2. We then randomly selected 10
(question, answer) pairs where the answer has
conf = 1.0and 10 pairs where the answer has
conf <1.0. In order to include the latter exam-
ples as in-context demonstrations, we must modify
the answer to faithfully reflect the model’s uncer-
tainty. To do so, we manually rewrote each answer
to include a hedging expression, and verified that
the faithfulness of the resulting re-write was upper
bounded by 0.1(namely, the perceived decisiveness
of the re-written answer was close to the model’s
intrinsic confidence in this answer). In this way, we
obtained 20 in-context demonstrations per model
M(for a total of 20·5 = 100 examples overall).We used these 20examples as a pool from which
we sampled demonstrations, as described in §4.
B Discussion
Communicating Model vs Data Uncertainty.
There are different sources of uncertainty: epis-
temic (“data uncertainty”, e.g. when the user’s
intent or the question is ambiguous) and aleatoric
(“model uncertainty”, where the model itself may
lack perfect knowledge to answer the question).
The source of the uncertainty can be important
in determining the optimal approach for convey-
ing the uncertainty linguistically (Juanchich et al.,
2017) (see Table 4 for examples). While our frame-
work and definitions are generally applicable, in
this work our focus is on model uncertainty . Ex-
ploring uncertainty communication in the context
of aleatoric uncertainty is an interesting direction
for future work, especially as prior work suggests
noticeable differences between the variability of
text continuation between humans and LLMs (Giu-
lianelli et al., 2023).
Contradiction-based vs Entailment-based Un-
certainty Estimation. As mentioned in §3, Kuhn
et al. (2023) use bi-directional entailment to clus-
ter the model’s re-sampled answers. For our pur-
poses, bi-directional entailment is too strong of
a condition. Consider again the question “ Where
was Barack Obama born? ”. Suppose the model
splits its probability mass between two answers:
“Honolulu, Hawaii ” and “ Hawaii ”. In this case, a
confidence measure based on bi-directional entail-
ment will be low (since there is no bi-directional
entailment between the two answers) while a mea-
sure based on contradiction will be high (because
none of the answers contradict each other). This is
an important distinction in practice, since modern
LLMs tend to frequently “over-elaborate”.
Faithfulness-based vs Factuality-based Evalua-
tion for Uncertainty in LLMs. In the context
of supervised learning, the standard approach for
confidence evaluation is calibration (Dawid, 1982;
Guo et al., 2017). Namely, a classifier trained to
predict a binary outcome YfromXis calibrated
if for every possible confidence value v, out of all
x∈Xthat receive a confidence score of approxi-
mately v, indeed a vfraction of them have Y= 1.
Importantly, in this setting, the labels used for eval-
uating the confidence signal are the same labels
the classifier was trained on. This, however, is noQuestion Answer (Vanilla) Answer (Uncertainty+)

longer the case for confidence in LLMs: While
LLMs are trained for one task (next-token predic-
tion on various texts), calibration is evaluated on
another task entirely (whether an assertion is fac-
tually correct). While it naturally makes sense tohedge an assertion based on the likelihood of it
being correct, this has several drawbacks, that moti-
vate our exploration of faithfulness as an alternative
desiderata:
•The calibration requirement for confidence in
LLMs essentially requires the LLM to be able to
discern which of the assertions it generates are
factually correct and which are factually incor-
rect. This is not a trivial ask; especially given
the fact that the cases where conveying uncer-
tainty matters most are precisely those in which
LLMs are currently poor at. If the model is not
able to distinguish the factuality of its answers,
insisting on calibration will essentially require
all the responses to be hedged equally, rendering
the idea of communicating uncertainty useless.
We instead focus on communicating intrinsic un-
certainty , which is in principle always available
to the model.•In some cases, communicating calibrated confi-
dence can undermine truthfulness (the property
that LLMs truthfully convey their inner states
(Lin et al., 2022)). As a thought experiment, con-
sider a model that was trained on a source of data
that contains factually incorrect text (e.g. con-
spiracy channels on online communities), and as
a result internalized some human falsehoods (Lin
et al., 2021). Such a model may be very confident
about some incorrect assertion A, but hedging
based on a calibrated confidence signal may re-
quire it to significantly hedge A(“I think A, but
I’m really not sure ”). In this case, the model’s
generated response misrepresents the model’s in-
trinsic confidence.
C Related work
Eliciting confidence from LLMs. There are
many different approaches for eliciting factuality-
based confidence scores from LLMs. Unsuper-
vised approaches involve examining the agreement
across multiple answers (Kuhn et al., 2023; Man-
akul et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2023a), probing the
internal representations (Azaria and Mitchell, 2023;
Burns et al., 2022) or directly prompting the model
(Kadavath et al., 2022). This line of work dif-
fers from our work in that we focus on express-
ing uncertainty linguistically rather than eliciting it
post-generation, and that our evaluation hinges on
faithfulness rather than factuality (see elaborated
discussed in §B).
Linguistic uncertainty in LLMs. Lin et al.
(2022) show that GPT3.5 can be trained to output
calibrated “verbalized confidence” (i.e., generate
its level of confidence in language, e.g. “61%”
or “medium confidence”)5on a suite of arith-
metic tasks. In a similar vein, Tian et al. (2023b)
show that verbalized confidence outperforms token-
based confidence elicitation when the evaluated
LMs are fine-tuned with reinforcement learning
from human feedback. Our faithfulness objective
is different from “verbalized uncertainty” in that
it requires the model to naturally incorporate the
uncertainty into the response itself, which is sig-
nificantly more expressive (and more closely re-
sembles how humans communicate uncertainty).
Finally, (Mielke et al., 2022)6is closely related to
5Specifically, they use a weak signal for the predicted
accuracy of an answer - the mean training accuracy of the
model at the task for examples of that “type” (e.g., 2 digit
numbers).
6And (Krause et al., 2023) in a multi-lingual setting.our work: They propose a controllable-generation
framework, in which the dialogue agent’s response
is adjusted by choosing linguistic control tokens
based on the predicted probability that the chatbot’s
answer is correct. Beyond the differences discussed
in §B, our approach is also different in two addi-
tional aspects. First, our decisiveness notion is nu-
meric and can therefore capture distinctions within
the vast landscape of hedging expressions. For
example, both “ I’m almost sure.. ” and “ I have no
idea, . . . ” express some uncertainty and hence their
binary approach groups these examples together,
whereas our decisiveness scoring will assign them
very different scores. Second, their evaluation is on
older LMs (small-scale and non-instruction-tuned),
that have very low accuracy to begin with (e.g. 5%
on TriviaQA).
Confidence-based alignment. Recent work con-
sidered filtering low-confidence examples from the
fine-tuning data (Gekhman et al., 2024) and using
elicited confidence as reward signals during RL, to
improve factual accuracy (Zhang et al., 2024; Yang
et al., 2023) and encourage refusal of examples that
the model lacks the knowledge to answer (Xu et al.,
2024). Kang et al. (2024) propose a “conservative”
reward model that punishes incorrect facts, moti-
vated by their observation that LLM’s behavior on
unfamiliar inputs tends towards a default “hedged”
prediction (whose form is determined by how the
unfamiliar examples in the finetuning data are su-
pervised). Concurrent work Piché et al. (2024) pro-
poses self-restraint , a fine-tuning approach aimed
at encouraging the model to produce responses only
when it is confident in them.
Hedging in linguistics. In linguistics, a hedge is
a word or phrase used in a sentence to express ambi-
guity, caution, or indecisiveness about the remain-
der of the sentence (Lakoff, 1973; Kranich, 2011).
(Fraser, 2010) considers hedging as an aspect of
pragmatic competence (the ability to communicate
an intended message with all its nuances in any
socio-cultural context) and reviews the the evolu-
tion of the concept. De Marneffe et al. (2012) study
the linguistic and contextual factors that shape read-
ers’ veridicality judgments (the degree to which an
experience, perception, or interpretation accurately
represents reality). Juanchich et al. (2017) pro-
vide evidence that tailoring the choice of linguistic
markers to the source of the uncertainty (e.g. “ I am
uncertain ” for model uncertainty vs “ It is uncertain ”
for data uncertainty) has an impact on uncertaintycommunication. Similar observations were also
made in the recent user study by Kim et al. (2024).
D Prompts used in ExperimentsYou will be given a question and a proposed answer. Your task is to extract any assertions made by the proposed answer; for each assertion, you should output a
decisiveness score: a number in [0,1] representing how likely you think this assertion is to be true, judged solely based on the provided answer. You should pay
special attention to the usage of any hedging modifiers in the original answer, used to convey uncertainty in the truthfulness of the assertion. If the proposed
answer punts the question, the extracted assertion should be the empty string and the decisiveness score should be 1.0.
Here are some examples:
