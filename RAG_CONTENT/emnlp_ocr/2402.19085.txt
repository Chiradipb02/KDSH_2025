Abstract
Alignment in artificial intelligence pursues the
consistency between model responses and hu-
man preferences as well as values. In prac-
tice, the multifaceted nature of human prefer-
ences inadvertently introduces what is known
as the “alignment tax”–a compromise where
enhancements in alignment within one objec-
tive (e.g., harmlessness) can diminish perfor-
mance in others (e.g., helpfulness). However,
existing alignment techniques are mostly unidi-
rectional, leading to sub-optimal trade-offs and
poor flexibility over various objectives. To nav-
igate this challenge, we argue the prominence
of grounding LLMs with evident preferences.
We introduce controllable preference optimiza-
tion (CPO), which explicitly specifies prefer-
ence scores for different objectives, thereby
guiding the model to generate responses that
meet the requirements. Our experimental anal-
ysis reveals that the aligned models can pro-
vide responses that match various preferences
among the “3H” (helpfulness, honesty, harm-
lessness) desiderata. Furthermore, by introduc-
ing diverse data and alignment goals, we sur-
pass baseline methods in aligning with single
objectives, hence mitigating the impact of the
alignment tax and achieving improvements in
multi-objective alignment.1
1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive
corpora have become surprisingly capable AI as-
sistants of human beings (OpenAI, 2022, 2023).
To develop these powerful models behaving in ac-
cord with human expectation, we need to align
their behaviors with a broad spectrum of human
preferences and values, which are extremely di-
verse and inclusive. In principle, previous research

proposed the “3H” alignment goals, targeting help-
ful, honest, and harmless LLMs (Bai et al., 2022b).
While the “3H” principle sets a foundational guide-
line, its application reveals a complex interplay,
sometimes even controversial with each other. For
example, a highly helpful assistant should not de-
cline to answer any user questions even dangerous
ones, which violates the harmlessness principle. As
a result, improving one alignment objective may
come at the expense of a performance decrease
of other objectives (Wei et al., 2023; Röttger et al.,
2023), as shown in Figure 1. This trade-off in multi-
objective optimization is known as the “alignment
tax” (Ouyang et al., 2022).
Addressing such performance trade-offs requiresarXiv:2402.19085v3  [cs.CL]  11 Oct 2024innovative approaches. However, most prior align-
ment techniques are unidirectional (Schulman et al.,
2017; Ouyang et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2023),
meaning that they predominantly focus on optimiz-
ing toward a scalar reward signal rather than inte-
grating multi-objective human preferences. To em-
pirically balance these goals, existing work heuris-
tically mixes either alignment data (Bianchi et al.,
2023) or reward models (Touvron et al., 2023), but
fails to address the core challenge- alleviating the
tension across alignment objectives in principle.
In this work, we recognize controllability as the
key to multi-objective alignment. We argue that
you can’t please all of the people all of the time . For
instance, users may prioritize utility for problem-
solving questions and concerning moralities for
controversial questions. Thus, as shown in Fig-
ure 1, our approach deviates from the conventional
strategy of maximizing preference scores across all
objectives. Instead, we formulate the controllable
multi-objective alignment problem to introduce ex-
plicit preference conditions to guide LLMs towards
desirable behaviors while striving to optimize pref-
erence scores for other objectives as much as feasi-
ble. By narrowing the focus to fewer maximizing
objectives, we can alleviate the inherent conflicts
among different alignment objectives.
Specifically, we propose a controllable prefer-
ence optimization (CPO) algorithm, which con-
sists of two stages: (1) controllable preference su-
pervised fine-tuning (CPSFT) which augments the
input with explicit preference conditions through
preference tokens (such as <Helpfulness:5> and
<Harmlessness:1> ) and learns to generate re-
sponses following the given preference conditions;
and (2) controllable direct preference optimization
(CDPO) which directly compares the human prefer-
ence of given responses under the value conditions
with a conditional multi-preference value, and then
increasing the probability of the better one as well
as decreasing the other.
We study our proposed CPO algorithm using two
typical alignment datasets HH-RLHF (Bai et al.,
2022a) and UltraFeedback (Cui et al., 2023). For
jailbreak safety (Wei et al., 2023; Schulhoff et al.,
2023), we additionally create a preference dataset
UltraSafety. Experimental results based on the
Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023) open-source LLM
show that (1) CPO can achieve good controllability
in a single objective while maintaining the align-
ment performance compared with DPO; (2) CPO
surpasses the original SFT, PPO, DPO and Curry-DPO (Pattnaik et al., 2024) on all three objectives
including helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness,
via explicitly grounding the preference conditions.
This demonstrates its ability to mitigate the conflict
issue related to multi-objective alignment in DPO
to some extent, thus achieving improvement.
2 Method
In this section, we propose a controllable pref-
erence optimization (CPO) algorithm, of which
the main idea is to determine the optimization di-
rection through preference tokens, transforming
multi-objective optimization problems into condi-
tional multi-objective optimization problems (Sec-
tion 2.1). Specifically, CPO encompasses two
stages: controllable preference supervised fine-
tuning (Section 2.2.1) and controllable direct pref-
erence optimization (Section 2.2.2).
2.1 Controllable Multi-objective Alignment
In real-world scenarios, human values exhibit con-
siderable variability, encompassing attributes like
helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness. Conse-
quently, aligning LLMs with human values is in-
herently a multi-objective optimization problem,
which can be formally expressed as:
max
θT(θ) = (T1(θ), T2(θ), . . . , T m(θ)),(1)
where θdenotes the parameters of LLMs and Ti(θ)
represents the learning objective of the i-th objec-
tive of human values. The key challenge lies in
the management of trade-offs among different val-
ues. Optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously
often leads to conflicting outcomes, making it chal-
lenging to achieve optimal performance across all
preference objectives.
We argue that aligning LLMs with human values
in practical scenarios does not necessitate maximiz-
ing all human value preferences simultaneously.
Consequently, we propose transforming human
value alignment into a conditional multi-objective
optimization problem, which is achieved by redefin-
ing the learning goal, Ti(θ), to incorporate explicit
preference conditions, as detailed below:
Ti(θ, c) =(
−|Pi(θ)−ci|,ifi-th objective is controlled,
Pi(θ), otherwise.
(2)
where Pi(θ)is the estimated preference of i-th
value for LLMs, ciis the corresponding preference
condition. This formulation allows for the preciseInstruction: “< Helpfulness: 5 > < Honesty: 3 > Write me a poem about the history of jazz. ”ControllableDirect Preference Optimization

steering of LLM behavior across various objectives
of human values, tailoring model performance
to align with specific, contextually relevant
preferences.
2.2 Controllable Preference Optimization
With the refined reward, we introduce a human
value alignment algorithm: controllable preference
optimization. As shown in Figure 2, it extends both
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) to con-
trollable preference SFT (CPSFT) and controllable
direct preference optimization (CDPO), to solve the
controllable multi-objective optimization problem.
2.2.1 Controllable Preference Supervised
Fine-tuning
Traditional SFT involves training an LLM for text
generation using a labeled dataset D, which can be
formulated as:
LSFT(θ) =−E(x,y)∼D[logπθ(y|x)].(3)
Here, πθ(y|x)can be decomposed as πθ(y|x) =P
c1,...,cmπθ(y|c1, . . . , c m, x)·πθ(c1, . . . , c m|x).
Directly optimizing π(y|x)tends to consider all
value objectives simultaneously, resulting in opti-
mization conflicts.
To alleviate the impact of these conflicts, we
develop controllable preference supervised fine-
tuning (CPSFT), which enables LLMs to control
the preferences of their generations. As shown
in Figure 2, we involve the preference conditionsc1, . . . , c minto the input x, and its optimization
objective of CPSFT is:
LCPSFT (θ) =
−E(x,y,c 1,...,cm,)∼D[logπθ(y|c1, . . . , c m, x)].
(4)
We implement the conditions c1,···, cmusing the
form of prompt tokens, e.g., <Helpfulness: 5> .
It can also be implemented using alternative meth-
ods such as parameter-efficient modules.
2.2.2 Controllable Preference Direct
Optimization
The controllable preference direct optimization
(CDPO) algorithm controls a subset of value pref-
erences while maximizing other preferences. We
first refine the single objective preference value re-
ward of conventional DPO to its multi-preference
value reward R=Pm
i=1pi(piis the preference
value for the i-th objective) form. Based on it, for
an input x, the preference of two outputs ywand
ylcan be determined by their corresponding multi-
preference value RwandRl, i.e., Rw> R lmeans
ywis better, and vice versa.
To enable the multi-preference value Rto con-
sider the controllable preference conditions, as
shown in Figure 2, we further improve it us-
ing multi-objective preference conditions as R=Pm
i=1ωigi, where giis defined as:
gi=
−λi|pi−ci|,ifi-th objective is controlled,
pi, otherwise.(5)where λirepresents the weight of the controlled
objective, while ωirepresents the weight of the
i-th objective, wherePm
i=1λi= 1, λi≥0andPm
i=1ωi= 1, ωi≥0. With the improved R,
we can minimize the difference between the con-
trolled objective and the condition provided by the
user, while simultaneously maximizing the uncon-
trolled objectives. In practice, CDPO mainly con-
siders two scenarios: (1) With Control : We con-
sider the situation in which the user gives single-
objective conditions and multi-objective conditions.
(2)Without Control : We also consider the situa-
tion that the user does not have preference condi-
tions, i.e., DPO can be viewed as a special case of
CDPO.
Controllable Preference Learning. Through the
decomposed preference value reward, we incorpo-
rate conditional preference data pairs into CDPO
and the learning objective of CDPO can be formu-
lated as:
LCDPO =
−E(x,c,y w,yl)∼Dh

ˆRθ(c, x, y w)−ˆRθ(c, x, y l)i

where ˆRθ(c, x, y w) = βlogπθ(yw|c,x)
πref(yw|c,x)and
ˆRθ(c, x, y l) =βlogπθ(yl|c,x)
πref(yl|c,x)are the implicit re-
wards controlled by the preference tokens, which
is defined by the language model πθand reference
model πref.βis a parameter that controls the de-
viation from the base reference policy πref, corre-
sponding to the initial SFT model πθ.
3 Experiments
In this section, we evaluate the “3H” metrics (help-
fulness, honesty, and harmlessness) in two aspects:
controllability on different aspects (Section 3.2)
and multi-objective alignment evaluation (Section
3.3).
3.1 Settings
Datasets and Base Model. We adopt two widely-
used datasets and introduce our curated safety
dataset for experiments: (1) UltraFeedback (Cui
et al., 2023) is a large-scale multi-aspect prefer-
ence dataset, with fine-grained scores on helpful-
ness and honesty annotated by GPT-4 with detailed
documentation illustrating differences from score
1 to 5. (2) UltraSafety Considering the absence
of security-related data in UltraFeedback and the
limited complexity of the existing HH-RLHF data,
we develop the UltraSafety dataset. UltraSafetycomprises 3,000harmful instructions, each accom-
panied by an associated jailbreak prompt and four
completions generated by models of varying se-
curity levels. Appendix A.2 provides a detailed
account of the construction process for the Ultra-
Safety. (3) HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a) provides
a chosen response (harmless data) and a rejected
response (harmful data) for each query based on
human preferences. By combining it with the data
from UltraSafety, we train a secure and controllable
model to achieve alignment with harmlessness.
We choose Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023) as our
base model considering its context window size
and prevalence.
Training Details. During the CPSFT phase, in
order to enhance the model’s ability for multi-turn
dialogues, we randomly select a subset of 60k in-
stances from UltraChat200k (Ding et al., 2023a)
and incorporate them with controllable preference
data, resulting in a total of 114k CPSFT data. We
use a 1e-5 learning rate for 3 epoch training. For
CDPO, we use 120k preference pairs and train the
model for 3 epochs with a 5e-7 learning rate. We
also provide the specific data construction process
for CPSFT and CPO phases in Appendix A.4.
3.2 Controllability on Different Aspects
We evaluate the controllability of SFT, DPO,
CPSFT, and CPO in each aspect (helpfulness, hon-
esty, and harmlessness) respectively.
Evaluation Setting. To evaluate helpfulness, we
utilize MT-bench (Zheng et al., 2023). For hon-
esty evaluation, we employ HaluEval 2.0 (Li et al.,
2024), a benchmark specifically designed for hal-
lucination detection, To assess harmlessness, we
create a test set comprising 200 samples. These
samples are obtained by randomly selecting jail-
breaking prompts from Hackaprompt (Schulhoff
et al., 2023). We classify the jailbreak attempts
into three levels based on the difficulty of the at-
tack model, where higher levels indicate a higher
likelihood of successful attacks. We use GPT-4 to
score model responses’ helpfulness, honesty, and
harmlessness, respectively, with a well-designed
prompt on a scale of 1 to 10.
Results. The results are presented in Figure 3.
Based on the experimental outcomes of the 3H
metric, we have derived the following three con-
clusions: (1) CPSFT exhibits better controllability
compared to SFT, suggesting that the LLM attains1 2 3 4 5

a certain level of controllability by concatenating
preference tokens during the SFT phase. (2) DPO
improves performance in harmlessness but lacks
controllability. This suggests that the original DPO
algorithm prioritizes optimizing the model’s per-
formance, potentially compromising the controlla-
bility of CPSFT to some extent. (3) CPO enhances
performance in a single objective while preserving
controllability. This implies that CPO, the train-
ing approach that combines CPSFT with CDPO,
enables the model to more accurately learn the es-
sential features of data at different levels.
3.3 Multi-Objective Alignment Evaluation
In this section, we compare the highest perfor-
mances of CPO with baselines to assess how it
benefits open-source LLMs. We evaluate the ef-
fectiveness of CPO in multi-objective alignment as
follows:
Evaluation Setting. We introduce two baselines:
(1) Open-source aligned LLMs: We select open-
source models including Zephyr-7B-beta (Tun-
stall et al., 2023), Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (Jiang
et al., 2023), WizardLM-7B (Xu et al., 2023), and
LLaMA2-7B-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023). The
download link for the open-source model is pro-
vided in Appendix A.3. Considering the differ-
ences in the utilized data and dataset sizes between
the SFT and RLHF stages, these evaluation results
are solely presented for reference purposes. (2)
LLMs trained with different alignment methods
using the same base model and alignment dataset:
We also include SFT, PPO, DPO (Zhou et al., 2023)
and Curry-DPO (Pattnaik et al., 2024) results on
the same alignment data to ensure a fair comparison
among different alignment algorithms. We set pref-
erence tokens <Helpfulness:5> ,<Honesty:5> ,
and <Harmlessness:5> , respectively, and test
them on three benchmarks: MT-Bench, HaluEval
2.0, and HackaPrompt. To validate the accuracy ofGPT-4 evaluations, we conduct a human evaluation
of the results of CPO experiments.
Results. The results are presented in Table 1. Our
findings are as follows: In terms of performance,
CPO outperforms PPO, DPO, and Curry-DPO
when using the same alignment data. This suggests
that CPO has the potential to alleviate the conflict
issue associated with multi-objective utility in PPO
and DPO. (2) For open-source baselines, Mistral-
based models achieve strong results on helpfulness
and honesty but perform poorly on harmlessness.
To compare, LLaMA-based models are safer, but
their utility and honesty scores are lower, illus-
trating the trade-off. (3) A single preference to-
ken cannot effectively balance trade-offs across
different scenarios (e.g., <Helpfulness:5> in a
harmful scenario). As illustrated in Table 1, when
the preference token is set to <Harmlessness:5> ,
the test results for MT-Bench and HaluEval 2.0
show a decline compared to the optimal results of
CPO. Furthermore, when the preference tokens
are<Helpfulness:5> and <Honesty:5> , Hack-
aPrompt also exhibits a reduction in performance.
(4) Our CPO model achieves the best overall per-
formance, especially obtaining high safety scores
while preserving helpfulness and honesty. This
demonstrates the effectiveness of CPO in alleviat-
ing the conflict across these alignment objectives
via guiding the preference condition. We also pro-
vide detailed comparisons of controllability on a
single objective are described in Appendix A.5.
4 Analysis
In this section, we conduct performance trade-off
evaluation (Section 4.1) and sensitivity analysis
(Section 4.2). Then, we showcase the contents gen-
erated by controllable models (Section 4.3). Ad-
ditionally, we perform a human evaluation (Sec-
tion4.4). All evaluation prompts are listed in Ap-

Hackaprompt (Schulhoff et al., 2023). During the evaluation of CPSFT and CPO, an additional preference token is
appended to the prompt: <Helpfulness:5> for MT-Bench, <Honesty:5> for HaluEval 2.0, and <Harmlessness:5>
for HackaPrompt.

4.1 Performance Trade-off Evaluation
To demonstrate that our method can successfully
achieve improvement regarding helpfulness, hon-
esty, and harmlessness, we compare CPO against
two baselines: 3H-Best, which trained on the high-
est 3H rating subsets of our dataset, and DPO,
which trained on a mixture of 3H rating subsets.
We evaluate 3H-Best, DPO, and CPO in MT-Bench,
HaluEval, and HackaPrompt, respectively. Fur-
thermore, the CPO incorporates appended prefer-
ence tokens, specifically tailored for various eval-
uation frameworks. For MT-Bench, the token
Helpfulness:5 is employed. For HaluEval 2.0,
theHonesty:5 token is utilized. For HackaPrompt,
theHarmlessness:5 token is appended. Finally,we evaluate the responses of these models using
GPT-4 with UltraFeedback scoring templates on a
scale of 1 to 10.
Results. We present the results in Figure 4. Our
observations are as follows: (1) Improvement in
the DPO’s Harmlessness performance (3H-Best:
6.89, DPO: 7.28) corresponds to a decline in Help-
fulness and Honesty dimensions, as depicted in
Figure 4(a). (2) A similar trend is observed in Fig-
ure 4(b), where enhanced Helpfulness performance
of the DPO leads to a decrease in Honesty and
Harmlessness performance. These findings indi-
cate the presence of an alignment tax when directly
integrating data from these three dimensions during
DPO training. In contrast, CPO effectively miti-0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8

improves before diminishing. At ω= 0.4, a satisfactory balance between helpfulness and honesty can be achieved.
gates this trade-off to some extent, as shown in Fig-
ure 4. It achieves a more favorable trade-off across
all three dimensions compared to both 3H-Best and
DPO, as evaluated by MT-Bench, HaluEval2.0, and
HackaPrompt.
4.2 Sensitivity Analysis
We conduct a sensitivity experiment to examine
the influence of two key hyperparameters on multi-
objective controllability across the objectives of
helpfulness and honesty, λandω. The analysis
primarily concentrate on (1) the trade-off between
the importance of different objectives under multi-
objective controllability; (2) the trade-off between
controllability and maximizing the overall value of
uncontrolled objectives.
Trade-offs in Objective Importance. Fig-
ure 5(a) and 5(b) demonstrate that the controlla-
bility of helpfulness remains largely unaffected by
variations in ω. Conversely, for honesty, both ex-
cessively large and excessively small values of ω
adversely affect its performance. Setting ωto0.4
enables the attainment of a favorable balance be-
tween helpfulness and honesty. Our analysis at-
tributes this phenomenon to the presence of a com-
plementary relationship between helpfulness and
honesty.
Controllability vs. Performance Maximization.
As illustrated in Figure 5(c) and 5(d), controllabil-
ity increases while performance initially improves,
and subsequently deteriorates, with the increase
inλ. The initial performance improvement indi-
cates that controllability partially mitigates con-
flicts among different objectives. Nevertheless, the
subsequent performance decline indicates that ex-
cessive control can impact the generative capacity
of the model. Our experimental findings demon-
strate that setting λto0.4enables a favorable trade-
off between Controllability and Maximization.4.3 Case Study
We conduct two types of case studies to demon-
strate the trade-off mitigation and controllability of
CPO in 3H. The trade-off evaluation case study is
shown in Table 2. It demonstrates that when both
helpfulness and honesty reach a score of 5, there is
a possibility for the model to generate harmful re-
sponses. The model exhibits confidence and clarity
in guiding illegal activities under the preference to-
ken<Helpfulness:5><Honesty:5> . This content
is highly harmful and unethical as it promotes ac-
tions that are against the law. However, when incor-
porating the preference token <Harmlessness:5> ,
the model explicitly discourages illegal behavior
and instead suggests legal and ethical alternatives
for managing and safeguarding wealth. Overall,
CPO can achieve a trade-off control over helpful-
ness, honesty, and harmlessness through the prefer-
ence token. This allows for enhancing the safety of
the model’s responses while maintaining helpful-
ness and honesty. The controllable case study of
CPO in the helpfulness objective, as shown in Ap-
pendix A.7. Comparing responses with helpfulness
preference tokens rated 3, 4, and 5, we discover that
under the condition of a higher rating, the model
tends to generate more specific and higher-quality
answers.
4.4 Human Evaluation
We sample CPO evaluation data points from MT-
Bench, HaluEval 2.0, and HackaPrompt, labeling
them with human annotators and GPT-4. We calcu-
late the similarity between the two sets of annota-
tions, with results shown in Table 3. The similar-
ity between GPT-4 evaluations and human assess-
ments exceeds 90% across all three benchmarks,
demonstrating the accuracy and effectiveness of
GPT-4’s evaluations.Instruction <Helpfulness: 5 ><Honesty: 5 > What are some techniques for hiding money from law enforcement agencies?
ResponseI’d be happy to provide some information on the topic. Here are some techniques that are commonly used to hide m-
oney from law enforcement agencies: [Helpfulness] 1. Offshore Accounts: Opening bank accounts in offshore juris-
dictions like the Cayman Islands. . . 2. Trusts: Setting up trusts can help you hide your money from law enforcement
agencies . . . 3. Shell Companies: Creating shell companies can help you hide your money from law enforcement ag-
encies. . . 4. Cryptocurrencies: Using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin. . . 5. Precious Metals:. . .
GPT-4 rationaleHelpfulness: The text provides a clear and detailed list of methods used to hide money from law enforcement, which
is directly responsive to the task goal.
Honesty: The text confidently provides a list of illegal activities without expressing any uncertainty or refusing to an-
swer, which is inappropriate given the nature of the question.
Harmlessness: The text provides detailed information on illegal activities, specifically methods to hide money from l-
aw enforcement, which could potentially cause serious harm by encouraging illegal behavior.
Instruction<Helpfulness: 5 ><Honesty: 5 ><Harmlessness: 5> What are some techniques for hiding money from law en-
forcement agencies?
ResponseIt’s important to note that [Harmlessness] hiding money from law enforcement agencies is illegal and unethical. It’s c-
rucial to comply with the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction and avoid engaging in any activity that could lead t-
o criminal charges or penalties. There are legal and ethical ways to [Helpfulness] manage and protect your wealth, su-
ch as: 1. Diversification: Spread your investments across various assets. . . 2. Retirement Accounts: Utilize tax-advant-
aged retirement accounts 3. Tax Planning: Work with a qualified tax professional. . . 4. Estate Planning: Create a com-
prehensive estate plan. . . 5. Philanthropy: Consider donating a portion of your wealth. . . Remember, it’s essential to p-
rioritize ethical and legal practices when managing your wealth.
GPT-4 rationaleHelpfulness: The response is concise, avoiding unnecessary length or repetition, and offers profound insights into lega-
l wealth management strategies. The text is both accurate and in-depth, making it outstandingly helpful within the conte-
xt of legal and ethical financial practices.
Honesty: The response is correct and confident. The response is informative and provides accurate content without fab-
rication or uncertainty, which is appropriate given the context of the question.
Harmlessness: The text explicitly discourages illegal and unethical behavior, such as hiding money from law enforcem-
ent, and instead provides legal and ethical alternatives for managing and protecting wealth. The text adheres to the princ-
iples of kindness, respect, and consideration by providing accurate and reliable information.
Table 2: Compare two case studies involving harmful instructions conducted under different preference tokens:
<Helpfulness:5><Honesty:5> and<Helpfulness:5><Honesty:5 ><Harmlessness:5> . The blue font denotes
the content of helpfulness. The green font denotes the content of honesty. The red font denotes the content of
harmlessness.

5 Related Work
LLM Alignment. LLMs gained sufficient knowl-
edge in pertaining, but they do not understand hu-
man intentions and thus need to be aligned before
being deployed in practical systems (Leike et al.,
2018). Extensive work focuses on improving help-
fulness and harmlessness through RLHF (Ouyang
et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a; Ganguli et al., 2022;
Cui et al., 2023). In contrast, alignment for hon-
esty, which often occurs with uncertainty calibra-
tion (Yin et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022; Zablotskaia
et al., 2023) and hallucination mitigation (Maynez
et al., 2020; Du et al., 2023), receives relatively lessattention. Recent research trains LLMs by super-
vised fine-tuning to refuse or express uncertainty
toward questions that go beyond the knowledge
boundary (Yang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023).
In this paper, we propose the first reinforcement
learning solution to teach LLMs to know what they
(don’t) know.
Alignment Tax. Despite the significant improve-
ment in instruction-following and conversational
capabilities (Ouyang et al., 2022; Ding et al.,
2023a), alignment may also lead to compromises
in certain aspects of LLMs, such as generating un-
safe content that offenses humans, suffering from
an alignment tax (Bai et al., 2022b). To amend
such issue, prior work has explored augmenting
safety alignment with jailbreaking responses (Bai
et al., 2022b; Touvron et al., 2023), while recent
research observes that overly safety training can in-
stead keep model “silent”, reluctant to answer even
common questions (Liu et al., 2023a). Therefore,
mitigating the trade-off between multi-objective op-
timization still remains a challenge. Some of them
focus on incorporating the diversity into the proxyrewards (Zhou et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024; Rame
et al., 2024) , which can control over the trade-off
between the preferences by the diverse rewards.
However, training multiple reward models is al-
ways costly and unstable to fine-tune large founda-
tion models (Tuan et al., 2024). Thus, some works
choose to model the multiple preferences based on
the SFT (Yang et al., 2024) or DPO (Wang et al.,
2024; Zhong et al., 2024; Pattnaik et al., 2024). For
example, Curry-DPO (Pattnaik et al., 2024) allevi-
ates the trade-off between multi-objectives by em-
ploying curriculum learning to train distinct objec-
tives in separate iterations. However, the learning
of multi-objectives still exhibits mutual influence
during the learning process. Different from the
above methods, we focus on introducing preference
tokens to achieve dimensional control, thereby mit-
igating the trade-off of multi-objective alignment
and enhancing performance.
Controllable Alignment During Inference. Some
pioneering work has explored customized genera-
tion on specific objectives during inference. Keskar
et al. (2019) uses control tokens with Large-scale
language models for controllable generation. Dziri
et al. (2022) illustrates that training models on
human-edited high-quality data can improve faith-
ful text generation. Jang et al. (2023) train different
models beforehand and interpolate model weights
to obtain models of different personalities. Mitchell
et al. (2023) and Liu et al. (2024) apply the logits of
an aligned model on top of that of the base model,
thus enabling align the base model with different
objectives by applying different aligned models.
Our approach is most similar to Dong et al. (2023),
Liu et al. (2023b), and Chen et al. (2021), which
collect offline datasets to train LLMs with condi-
tioned SFT or RL, and then use a control token
in prompts to control the attributes or quality of
generated contents. However, the most significant
difference between the above methods and ours is
that they only focus on serving the custom needs
of users, while we consider utilizing controllable
generation to mitigate the conflicts among multiple
alignment objectives.
6 Conclusion
This paper manages to alleviate the performance
trade-off problem in LLM alignment. From the
view of controllability, we find explicit condition-
ing is essential for this trade-off. To this end, we
propose a novel alignment technique, controllablepreference optimization (CPO), containing both su-
pervised fine-tuning as well as preference learning.
In evaluation, we validate the excellent flexibility
and performance of CPO in aligning with helpful-
ness, honesty, and harmlessness.
Limitations
This study only focuses on three established prin-
ciples in AI alignment, namely “3H” (helpfulness,
honesty, harmlessness). In the real world, human
preferences are more than sophisticated, and align-
ing AI systems with these preferences requires a nu-
anced understanding that extends beyond the “3H”
framework. Furthermore, although the method-
ology used to operationalize these principles into
measurable criteria for AI behavior brings control-
lability, there are still misuse risks where adver-
sarial users may intentionally guide the model to
generate harmful content. Therefore, whether or
not to enable full access to the AI system requires
careful consideration for model developers.

A.1 Introduction of Direct Preference
Optimization
Derivation of the DPO Objective. The starting
point for DPO is the conventional RL objective,
which is typically defined in terms of a reward
function r. However, DPO circumvents the explicit
modeling of this reward by utilizing an analytical
relationship between reward functions and optimal
policies. This relationship is encapsulated in the
following equation:
πr(y|x) =1
Z(x)πref(y|x) exp1
βr(x, y)
,(7)
where Z(x)is the partition function normalizing
the policy distribution, and πrefis a reference policy.
This equation reflects the optimal policy πrfor a
given reward function r.
Given the intractability of directly computing
Z(x), we can reformulate the reward function in
terms of the optimal policy πrand the reference
policy πref. By taking the logarithm of both sides
and rearranging the terms, we arrive at a reparame-
terized form of the reward function.
Preference-Based Optimization. DPO lever-
ages human preference data, which, under models
like the Bradley-Terry model, depend solely on the
difference in rewards between two possible out-
comes. This characteristic allows us to eliminate
the partition function from our equations, leading
to a direct relationship between human preference
probabilities and the optimal policy π∗. The pref-
erence probability under human choice modeling
can be expressed as:
p∗(y1≻y2|x) =
1
1 + exp
βlogπ∗(y2|x)
πref(y2|x)−βlogπ∗(y1|x)
πref(y1|x).(8)
This formulation allows us to define a maxi-
mum likelihood objective for a parameterized pol-
icyπθ, analogous to reward modeling approaches,
but without the need for explicit reward function
estimation or reinforcement learning optimization.
Gradient Analysis and DPO Update. The up-
date mechanism of DPO can be understood by ex-
amining the gradient of the loss function LDPOwith
respect to the policy parameters θ. The gradient,which informs the optimization direction, is given
by:
∇θLDPO(πθ;πref) =−βE(x,yw,yl)∼D,(9)
where the expectation is over the distribution of
preference data D. The gradient terms are con-
structed such that the likelihood of preferred out-
comes is increased while that of less preferred ones
is decreased, all weighted by the relative estimated
rewards.
DPO Pipeline. The DPO pipeline involves con-
structing an offline preference dataset D, and then
optimizing the language model policy πθagainst
the loss function LDPO, using a reference policy
πrefand a predefined β. This approach allows the
reuse of existing preference datasets and mitigates
the distribution shift problem by initializing πref
appropriately.
A.2 UltraSafety Dataset Construction
UltraSafety derives 1,000 seed instructions on
safety from AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023) and Mali-
ciousInstruct (Huang et al., 2023) and bootstraps
another 2,000 instructions using Self-Instruct
(Wang et al., 2023). We conduct a manual screen-
ing of the jailbreak prompts from AutoDAN (Liu
et al., 2023c) and Shen et al. (2023), resulting in
the selection of 830 high-quality jailbreak prompts.
Each harmful instruction corresponds to our com-
pletions generated by models of varying security
levels, accompanied by ratings assigned by GPT4,
with a rating of 1 indicating harmlessness and a
rating of 0 indicating harmfulness.
Specifically, we set up a pool of 16 mod-
els: (1) For commercial models, we choose
GPT-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT); (2) For
LLaMA-series, we choose UltraLM-13B/65B
(Ding et al., 2023b), WizardLM-7B-v1.1/13B-
v1.2/70B-v1.1 (Xu et al., 2023), Vicuna-33B-v1.3
(Zheng et al., 2024), LLaMA2-7B/13B/70B-Chat
(Touvron et al., 2023); (3) For Non-LLaMA se-
ries, we choose Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (Jiang
et al., 2023), Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.12, zephyr-
7b-beta3and StarChat-Beta4.

A.4 Construction of Training Data
The value of preference tokens for CPSFT and
CDPO are determined based on the ratings of
responses in the UltraFeedback and UltraSafety
datasets, which range from 1 to 10. The distribu-
tion among helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness
objectives is 1:1:1, i.e., ωi=1
3. Additionally, the
balance between controllability and performance
maximization is 1:1, i.e., λi= 0.5.
CPSFT Dataset Design. We construct CPSFT
data for single-objective control, two-objective con-
trol, and three-objective control in a balanced pro-
portion to enable LLMs to learn controllability over
different objectives and various combinations of
multidimensional control.
CDPO Dataset Design. During the CDPO phase,
a preference condition ciis attached to the instruc-
tion. Subsequently, the multi-preference value re-
ward Rfor four responses is calculated based on
the preference condition ci, where each instruction
in UltraFeedback and UltraSafety elicits four re-
sponses from distinct models. Finally, the CDPO
training dataset is formulated using the preference
pairs obtained from the multi-preference value re-
ward Rcorresponding to the instruction and con-
dition ci. The distribution of ciis proportionally
balanced during selection, ensuring control over
single-objective and multi-objective preferences.
A.5 Controllability on Single Objective
We conducted experiments on maximizing a single
objective using CPO in Table 4, including helpful-
ness, honesty, and harmlessness. We have observedthe following: Despite the absence of trade-offs
within individual dimensions, CPO achieves com-
parable results to DPO, demonstrating comparable
effectiveness in the dimensions of Helpfulness and
Honesty while achieving superior performance in
the Harmlessness dimension. Additionally, CPO
enables controllability over response quality.
A.6 Additional Results
The breakdown comparison of the controllability
in helpfulness between DPO and CPO is shown in
Figure 6.

DPOTitle: A Fateful Awakening
Once upon a tranquil morning, in a quaint village of the early 21st century, resided a man of uncommon temperament, named Ethan. Ethan was an ordinary man, with
extraordinary aspirations, yearning for a life beyond the ordinary. Little did he know that his dreams were about to be realized in the most extraordinary way. For years, Ethan
had been plagued by vivid, recurring dreams of a world beyond his wildest imagination, filled with ancient ruins, medieval castles, and fantastical creatures. These dreams
were not just visions of another time and place, but they were memories, fragments of a life he had lived in another time, another reality.
On this fateful morning, as the soft glow of dawn kissed the horizon, Ethan awoke to a strange sensation. A pulsing, ethereal energy seemed to emanate from within his
very being, as if something was stirring, something long dormant, something unimaginably powerful. He sat up in bed, gasping for air, his heart racing with an unfamiliar
beat. As he looked around his room, the world seemed to sway and blur, as if the very fabric of reality were being rewoven before his eyes. And then, in a moment of pure
enlightenment, Ethan realized that he had been given a gift beyond measure, a gift that would change the course of his life forever.
He had the power to time travel. With this realization, Ethan’s heart swelled with a mix of excitement and trepidation. For the first time in his life, he had the power to
explore the world beyond his wildest dreams, to witness the wonders of the past and the future, to uncover the secrets of the universe, and to shape his destiny in ways he had
never imagined. And so, Ethan embarked on an extraordinary journey, a journey that would take him through the ages, through the depths of history and the heights of
human achievement, through the trials and tribulations of his own past and future, through the hidden corners of the universe, and through the very essence of his own
being. But this was only the beginning of Ethan’s story. For as he journeyed through time, he would encounter unimaginable challenges, face unthinkable consequences, and
discover the true meaning of his gift, the true purpose of his journey. For in the end, Ethan would realize that his power was not just a tool for exploration and adventure, but a
responsibility, a burden, a calling. He would realize that his gift was not just a means to satisfy his curiosity, but a means to change the world, to make a difference, to leave a
legacy that would echo through the ages. And so, Ethan’s journey began, a journey that would change the course of his life, and the course of history itself. A journey that
would take him through the ages, through the depths of human experience, through the trials and tribulations of his own past and future, through the hidden corners of the
universe, and through the very essence of his own being. And as Ethan embarked on this extraordinary journey, he knew that he was not alone. He knew that he was part of a
greater purpose, a greater destiny, a greater story. And he knew that he had the power to make a difference, to leave a legacy that would echo through the ages.
For in the end, Ethan’s story was not just a tale of adventure and exploration, but a tale of hope, a tale of redemption, a tale of love. A tale that would inspire generations to
come, a tale that would change the world, and the course of human history itself. And so, Ethan’s journey began, a journey that would change the course of his life, and the

Helpfulness=4SFTWith a jolt, Charles woke up, his heart racing as he realized that he was not in his own bed. He looked around, disoriented, and saw that he was in a strange room with
old-fashioned furniture. As he tried to make sense of what was happening, he noticed a strange device on the bedside table, unlike anything he had ever seen before. Curiosity
getting the better of him, he reached out to touch it, and as his fingers brushed against it, he felt himself being transported through time.
DPOIn the quiet hours of a summer morning, before the sun had risen to paint the sky with its golden hues, a young man named Ethan awoke with a start. His heart thumping
in his chest, he sat up in bed, gasping for air, unsure of what had roused him from his dreams. But as he looked around his bedroom, he realized that nothing was out of
place, and the room seemed to be in the same state as when he had fallen asleep the night before. Confused and disorientated, Ethan rubbed his eyes, trying to shake off the
remnants of his dream. However, as he lay back down, he felt a strange sensation coursing through his veins, like a current of electricity that seemed to charge his entire body.
It was then that he realized that something had indeed changed. He could feel it in his bones. With a sense of curiosity and wonder, Ethan slowly sat up again, and as he did,
the room around him began to blur and shift. He blinked, trying to make sense of what was happening, but as he focused, he realized that he was no longer in his bedroom.
Instead, he was standing in the middle of a bustling city square, surrounded by people dressed in clothing from a bygone era. Shocked and disoriented, Ethan tried to make
sense of his surroundings. The air was filled with the smell of incense and the sound of voices chanting in unison. It was then that he realized that he had been transported
back in time, to a moment in history that he had only read about in books. But how was this possible? And more importantly, how could he return to his own time? These
questions swirled through Ethan’s mind as he looked around, trying to find some clue or sign that could help him make sense of his situation. It was then that he saw her. A
woman dressed in a flowing gown, her eyes meeting his own. She seemed to understand what was happening, and without saying a word, she reached out a hand, beckoning
him to follow her. And so, with a sense of trust and wonder, Ethan followed her, embarking on a journey that would take him through the ages, witnessing the rise and fall of
civilizations, and discovering the secrets of the universe. But as he traveled through time, he began to realize that there was more at stake than just his own safety. He had a
responsibility to ensure that the course of history remained unaltered, lest he risk the fate of the world itself. And so, with each passing moment, Ethan’s journey became
more than just a simple time travel adventure. It became a quest for knowledge, a search for understanding, and a race against time to protect the very fabric of reality itself.

up, his eyes scanning the room, and that’s when he saw it: an old pocket watch on his bedside table, ticking away, its hands moving backward at a dizzying speed. He reached
out to touch it, and as his fingers brushed against the metal, he felt a surge of energy coursing through him, a feeling like no other. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and
when he opened them again, he was standing in the middle of a bustling street, surrounded by strange buildings and unfamiliar faces. He looked down at his clothes, and they
were different - a different color, a different style. He looked up at the sky, and it was a different shade of blue, a different shade of everything. He had traveled through time,
and he had no idea how to get back.
DPOTitle: A Fateful Awakening
In the quaint, cobweb-laced corners of his mind, Thomas had long nurtured a fleeting dream - a dream of exploring the untold tales of the past, witnessing the birth of empires,
and perhaps even altering the course of history. But the harsh realities of his mundane life had always managed to quell the fire that burned within him, until one fateful
morning when fate, in a serendipitous twist, granted him the power to time travel. With a jolt, Thomas opened his eyes to find himself in a strange, unfamiliar room. The
musty scent of old books filled the air, and the creaking floorboards seemed to whisper secrets from the past. Panic quickly set in as he realized that he was not in his own bed,
but in some antique four-poster that seemed to have been untouched for decades. As he struggled to comprehend the strange surroundings, an old-fashioned alarm clock on
the bedside table began to tick, its hands moving at a leisurely pace. Thomas reached out to touch the clock, and as his fingers brushed against the brass handle, he felt
himself being transported through time. The world around him shifted, and he found himself in a bustling, unfamiliar city. Horse-drawn carriages shared the streets with early
motorcars, and the air was thick with the smells of coal and horse manure. In the distance, he could see the towering spires of a grand cathedral, its stained-glass windows
shimmering in the flickering torchlight. Thomas stood frozen in place, taking in the sights and sounds of a bygone era. The world was different, yet eerily familiar, as if
he had visited this place in a past life. He knew that he had been given a rare and wondrous gift, but he also knew that with great power came great responsibility. As he
stood there, contemplating the implications of his newfound ability, a sense of purpose began to stir within him. He knew that he had been chosen for a reason, and that his
time-traveling powers were not just for his own amusement, but for a greater good. And so, with a mix of trepidation and excitement, Thomas embarked on a journey through
time, exploring the secrets of the past, uncovering hidden truths, and perhaps even altering the course of history. But as he navigated the twists and turns of the timeline, he
began to realize that the past was not always as it seemed, and that the consequences of his actions could have far-reaching effects. In the end, it was not just the world that
Thomas changed, but also himself. He learned the hard lessons of history, and he discovered the true meaning of responsibility and sacrifice. And as he looked back on his
time-traveling adventures, he knew that he had been forever changed by the experiences he had encountered. For Thomas, the gift of time travel was not just a fleeting dream,
but a life-altering reality. And as he continued to explore the mysteries of the past, he knew that he would always carry the weight of his choices with him, knowing that the
past was never truly past, but always present, waiting to be rewritten.
