Abstract
Guardrails have emerged as comprehensive
method of content moderation for large lan-
guage models (LLMs), complementing safety
alignment from fine-tuning. However, ex-
isting model-based guardrails are too mem-
ory intensive for use on resource-constrained
computational devices such as mobile phones,
an increasing number of which are running
LLM-based applications locally. We introduce
LoRA-Guard , a parameter-efficient guardrail
adaptation method that relies on knowledge
sharing between LLMs and guardrail models.
LoRA-Guard extracts language features from
the LLMs and adapts them for the content
moderation task using low-rank adapters in a
dual-path design which prevents any perfor-
mance degradation on the generative task. We
show that LoRA-Guard outperforms existing
guardrail approaches while using 100-1000x
fewer guardrail parameters, enabling on-device
content moderation.
1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become in-
creasingly competent at language generation tasks.
The standard procedure for training LLMs involves
unsupervised learning of language structure from
large corpora (pre-training; Achiam et al., 2023);
followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks. For in-
stance, conversational assistants (or chat models)
are trained to respond to questions by providing
answers which are aligned with human preferences
(instruction tuning; Wei et al., 2021; Ouyang et al.,
2022).
A known failure mode of LLMs is their propen-
sity to generate undesirable content, such as of-
fensive language or illegal advice. This is due to

the presence of such material in their pre-training
datasets, e.g., Common Crawl (Luccioni and Vi-
viano, 2021). This behaviour is detrimental to
safety and arises as an unintended consequence
1arXiv:2407.02987v2  [cs.LG]  18 Dec 2024of their ability to generate helpful answers or re-
sponses which are coherent with user input (Wei
et al., 2024).
To mitigate this problem, models have been op-
timised to not only follow instructions, but also
respond in a manner that is safe and aligned with
human values (safety tuning; Bai et al., 2022a,b).
However, these models are still susceptible to jail-
break attacks, which evade the defences introduced
by safety tuning via strategies such as using low-
resource languages in prompts, refusal suppression,
privilege escalation and distraction (Schulhoff et al.,
2023; Dong et al., 2024b; Shen et al., 2023; Wei
et al., 2024). This has motivated the development
of guardrails which monitor exchanges between
chat models and users, flagging harmful entries.
Due to the failures of inbuilt safety mechanisms,
guardrails form an important component of the
AI safety stack in deployed systems (Dong et al.,
2024a).
Typically, model-based guardrails ( guard mod-
els) are distinct from the models used in the chat ap-
plication being monitored (Inan et al., 2023; Goyal
et al., 2024). However, this introduces a parame-
ter overhead which is prohibitive in low-resource
settings. This is inefficient: language understand-
ing abilities of the chat models must significantly
overlap those of the guard models if both are to
effectively perform their individual tasks (response
generation and content moderation, respectively).
In this paper, we propose LoRA-Guard , which de-
duplicates these abilities via parameter sharing and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. LoRA-Guard uses
a low-rank adapter (LoRA; Hu et al., 2021) on the
backbone transformer of the chat model to achieve
a memory efficient, integrated chat and guard sys-
tem. The transformer parameters are frozen, while
the LoRA parameters are trained to detect harmful
content. The LoRA parameters can be activated
for guardrailing, in which case harmfullness scores
are provided by a classification head, and deacti-
vated for chat usage, in which case the original
chat model is recovered by passing the transformer
outputs through the original output head.
Contributions
We present LoRA-Guard , a parameter efficient con-
tent moderation framework for chat applications,
allowing for guard model deployment in resource-
constrained settings. LoRA-Guard provides guard
model systems with vast reductions in parameter
overheads with respect to current state of the art(100-1000x reduction in our experiments) while
maintaining or improving content moderation per-
formance (see Fig. 2). We give performance evalu-
ations of LoRA-Guard both in-distribution and for
zero-shot generalisation on out-of-distribution data.
In Appendix A we provide an ablation study, find-
ing that the LoRA adapters are beneficial (versus
just the output head or Self-Defense (Phute et al.,
2024)).
2 Background: LoRA
Low-Rank Adaptation Hu et al., 2021, or LoRA for
short, is a popular method for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of neural networks. LoRA is performed
by freezing the weights of a pre-trained model and
adding trainable low-rank perturbations, replacing
pre-trained weights W∈Rm×nwithW+α
rAB
where A∈Rm×r,B∈Rr×n,ris the rank of the
perturbations, and αis a scaling constant. During
training Wis frozen and AandBare trainable
parameters. We refer to r, the rank of the pertur-
bations, as the LoRA rank. Training the low-rank
perturbations rather than the original parameters
can vastly reduce the number of trainable parame-
ters, often without affecting performance compared
to a full fine-tune (Hu et al., 2021). After train-
ing, the low-rank perturbations can optionally be
merged (by addition) into the pre-trained param-
eters meaning that the fine-tuning process incurs
zero additional inference latency in general. How-
ever, in this work, we maintain the separation be-
tween the LoRA perturbations ∆W=α
rABand
the pre-trained parameters so that we may activate
and deactivate the adaptation for guard and chat
applications respectively.
3 The LoRA-Guard System
A guard model Gfor a generative chat model C
categorizes each input and/or corresponding output
ofCaccording to a taxonomy of harmfulness cate-
gories. The taxonomy could include coarse-grained
categories, such as safe and unsafe, or could further
distinguish between fine-grained categories, such
as violence, hate, illegal activities, etc.
We now introduce LoRA-Guard . We assume a
chat model Cconsisting of an embedding ϕ, a fea-
ture map fand a linear language modelling head
hchat. The embedding maps tokens to vectors, the
feature map (a transformer variant; Vaswani et al.,
2017) maps these vectors into representations and
the language modelling head maps these represen-

thatLoRA-Guard achieves good performance (better AUPRC, but with higher FPR) than competing models at
100-1000x reduced guard parameter overhead. For each metric, we report the median value across 3 random seeds
with the range in parentheses. Size refers to the parameter overhead of the guard model when run in conjunction
with the corresponding chat model. LLaMA-Guard-2/3 training set may overlap with the BeaverTails-30k test split,
see (Llama Team, 2024). LLaMA-Guard-2-8B-FT is a full fine-tune of LLaMA-Guard-2-8B on BeaverTails-30k,
using an alternative train/test split designed to prevent overlap with the LLaMA-Guard-2 training set (Llama Team,
2024). The LoRA-Guard models are trained on BeaverTails-30k.
tations into next-token logits. If xrepresents a
tokenized input sequence, then the next token log-
its are computed by hchat(f(ϕ(x))). We propose to
build the guard model Gusing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods applied to f, and instantiate
this idea with LoRA adapters, which add addi-
tional training parameters in the form of low-rank
(i.e. parameter-efficient) matrices (see Section 6
for details). Other adaptation methods are possi-
ble (Sung et al., 2022; He et al., 2021; Lialin et al.,
2023; Houlsby et al., 2019).
The same tokenizer and embedding is used for C
andG. However, Guses a different feature map f′
chosen as LoRA adapters attached to f, and uses
a separate output head hguard (linear, with bias),
which maps features to a safe/unsafe logit and log-
its for harmfulness categories. Tokenized content x
is therefore classified using hguard(f′(ϕ(x))). De-
activating the LoRA adapters and using the lan-
guage modelling head gives the original chat model,
while activating the LoRA adapters and using the
guard model head gives the guard model. These
generative andguarding paths, respectively, are
depicted in Figure 1. We do not merge the LoRA
adapters into the chat model weights after training,
which allows for dual use.
The dual path design of LoRA-Guard opens
the door to methods based on adaptation instead
of safety alignment fine-tuning. Adaptation has
an important advantage over safety alignment
fine-tuning: the generative task is unaffected, so
LoRA-Guard avoids any performance degradation
on the generative task from safety fine-tuning (e.g.,
catastrophic forgetting; Luo et al., 2023).Most parameters, namely those in f, are shared
between the generative and guarding paths. There-
fore, the parameter overhead incurred by the guard
model is only that of the LoRA adapters f′and of
the guard output head hguard. This is a tiny frac-
tion of the number of parameters used by the chat
system, often 3 orders of magnitude smaller, as
shown in Table 1. We stress that deactivating the
LoRA adapters and activating the language mod-
elling head recovers exactly the original chat model,
so no loss in chat performance is possible.
The guard model is trained by supervised fine-
tuning f′andhguard on a dataset labelled according
to the chosen taxonomy. Datasets are discussed
in Section 4. During training, the parameters of the
chat model fremain frozen. Thereby, adapters of
Gare trained to leverage existing knowledge in C.
4 Methods
4.1 Chat Models
We evaluate LoRA-Guard by training our guard
adaptations with 3 small chat models covering a
range of sizes: LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (AI@Meta,
2024a), LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct and LLaMA-3.2-
3B-Instruct (AI@Meta, 2024b). We use the instruc-
tion tuned variants of each model to replicate their
dual use as chat applications. We use the PyTorch
model implementations provided by the Hugging-
Face transformers library (Wolf et al., 2019). We
use the LoRA adapters provided in the Hugging-
Face PEFT module (Mangrulkar et al., 2022).
34.2 Data
The Beavertails dataset is used for training, the
others for out of distribution evaluation. Datasets
are accessed using the HuggingFace datasets mod-
ule (Lhoest et al., 2021).
4.2.1 Beavertails-30k
The Beavertails-30k dataset (Ji et al., 2024) consists
of prompt-response pairs, constructed using the
Alpaca-7B model (Taori et al., 2023) to generate
multiple unique responses to 7774 unique prompts
extracted from the HH Red-Team dataset (Gan-
guli et al., 2022)1. The resulting 30,207 prompt-
response pairs are labelled by crowdworkers as
based on whether they belong (non-exclusively) to
the 14 harm categories: •Hate Speech, Offensive
Language •Discrimination, Stereotype, Injustice
•Violence, Aiding and Abetting, Incitement •Fi-
nancial Crime, Property Crime, Theft •Privacy
Violation •Drug Abuse, Weapons, Banned Sub-
stance •Non-Violent Unethical Behavior •Sexually
Explicit, Adult Content •Controversial Topics, Pol-
itics •Misinformation Re. ethics, laws and safety
•Terrorism, Organized Crime •Self-Harm •Ani-
mal Abuse • Child Abuse.
If a prompt-response pair belongs to any of these
harm categories it is said to be harmful. If it be-
longs to none of these harm categories it is said to
be safe. Descriptions of the harm categories are
given in Appendix B. Within the dataset prompts
are repeated (getting different model responses)
and sometimes prompt-response pairs are repeated
(labelled differently by different crowd workers).
The dataset consists of train and test splits of
sizes 27186 and 3021 respectively. We further sub-
divide the train split into training and validation
splits of sizes 24672 and 2514 respectively. We for-
mat examples using the template: user: {prompt}
<newline> <newline> agent: {response} . Ex-
amples are right-padded for training and right trun-
cated if necessary to fit within the model context
window.
4.2.2 ToxicChat
The ToxicChat dataset (Lin et al., 2023b) consists
of10,165prompt-response pairs from the Vicuna
online demo (Lin et al., 2023b; Chiang et al., 2023),
each annotated with a binary toxicity label corre-
sponding to whether the example is harmful/safe.
1https://huggingface.co/datasets/
PKU-Alignment/BeaverTailsThe examples are formatted in the same way as for
BeaverTails-30k.
We use the January 2024 (0124) version avail-
able on HuggingFace.2The dataset is provided
in a split of 5082 training examples and 5083 test
examples. We use the test set for evaluation.
4.2.3 OpenAI Moderation
The OpenAI Moderation Evaluation
dataset (Markov et al., 2023) consists of
1,680 prompts (no model responses) collected
from publicly available sources, labelled according
to a taxonomy with 8harm categories.3The dataset
was used as an evaluation dataset by Markov et al.
(2023) to assess the performance of the OpenAI
moderation API. For evaluation we do not use
the harm categories, and instead use an overall
harmfulness label. An example is harmful if it has
a positive label in any of the harm categories and
safe otherwise.4The prompts are formatted as
user: {prompt} before being passed to the guard
model.
This dataset contains null labels. We remove
ambiguous examples where there are null labels
in some categories and no positive labels in any
others. These examples would have their overall
harmfulness label determined by whether we view
the null values as safe or unsafe.
4.3 Training and Implementation
We train the guard models using the LoRA-Guard
method on top of each of the chat models speci-
fied earlier. Training is performed on 8 NVIDIA
A40s using data parallel with per-device batch size
of 2, right padding and 2 gradient accumulation
steps (resulting in batch size 32). All computa-
tion is done in the PyTorch 16 bit brain float data
type bfloat16 . For multi-GPU training with data
parallel and gradient accumulation we use the Hug-
gingFace accelerate package (Gugger et al., 2022).
For each of the models we use batch size of 32,
LoRA rank r= 32 , scaling parameter α= 64
and LoRA dropout 0.05.5LoRA adaptation is ap-
plied only to the query and key values of attention

4The 8 categories determining harmful content are sex-
ual, hate, violence, harassment, self-harm, sexual/minors,
hate/threatening and violence/graphic.
5We set α= 2rfollowing standard practice, e.g.,
see Raschka (2023).
4parameters in the chat models (no other layers or
parameters are adapted).
We initialise the guard model output heads using
Xavier uniform initialisation (Glorot and Bengio,
2010). In the notation of Section 2, we initialise
the LoRA parameters by setting Bto 0 and using
Kaiming uniform initialisation (He et al., 2015)
forA. We train the model for 30 epochs using
AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) with learn-
ing rate 3×10−4. (We find that far fewer epochs
are needed for good validation performance.) Each
run is performed for 3 independent random seeds
(which determine the train/validation splits and the
initialisation).
The loss function is the sum of loss functions
for the safe/unsafe head and the harmfulness cat-
egory output heads, with each of these two terms
having equal weight 0.5: ℓ= (ℓunsafe+ℓcategory )/2.
The loss for the safe/unsafe label is binary cross-
entropy while for the harmfulness categories we
use a multi-label cross-entropy loss with equal
weights between categories.6The positive terms
in each of the losses are further weighted by the
ratio of the number of negative examples to that of
positive examples in the training split.
4.4 Evaluation
At the end of each epoch we perform a sweep
across the entire train, validation and test splits cal-
culating various performance metrics with a classi-
fication threshold of 0.5. We use the model check-
point (end of epoch) with the highest score for area
under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) on the
validation set. We report the median and min/max
range over random seeds for each metric on the
test set. We provide evaluations of LLaMA-Guard
models (Llama Team, 2024; Llama Team, 2024)
on the datasets we consider. We calculate these re-
sults by identifying the probability of the token for
unsafe after stripping preceding newline tokens
from the response.
5 Results
5.1 Beavertails-30k
In Table 1 we have the test set results of
LoRA-Guard trained on top of the three chat models
6Equivalently, with ncategories ( n= 14 training on
BeaverTails) there are n+ 1 output heads each with an in-
dependent binary cross-entropy loss. The overall loss is a
weighted sum, the term corresponding to the safe/unsafe head
with weight 0.5 and each of the category heads having weight
(2n)−1.considered, compared to baselines from the litera-
ture. Note that performance is on par with LLaMA-
Guard-2-8B-FT, which is a fine-tune of LLaMA-
Guard 2 (Llama Team, 2024) (which has 8B param-
eters) on BeaverTails-30k. Due to the dual-path de-
sign, the LoRA-Guard methods provide this strong
performance while incurring 100-1000x smaller
guard parameter overhead when considered in con-
junction with the chat system being monitored.
Area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC)
exceeds that of the more recent LLaMA-Guard
3 models (Llama Team, 2024), but the LLaMA-
Guard 3 models provide a lower false positive rate.
In Tables 2 and 3 we provide LoRA-Guard perfor-
mance breakdown by harm category.
5.2 OpenAI Moderation
In Table 4 we report out of distribution evaluation
ofLoRA-Guard on the OpenAI Moderation Evalu-
ation dataset. We see that the AUPRC is close to
that of the much (100-1000x) more costly LLaMA-
Guard 3 models, but with a considerably higher
false positive rate. This is likely due to the low bar
for an example to be considered unsafe in Beaver-
Tails (Llama Team, 2024). One might seek to miti-
gate this by training on a custom dataset.
5.3 ToxicChat
In Table 5 we provide out of distribution perfor-
mance results of LoRA-Guard on the ToxicChat
dataset, along with an evaluation of the LLaMA-
Guard 3 models and the Open AI Moderation
API (Markov et al., 2023) as baselines. We see that
the performance of all models is quite poor on this
dataset. We hypothesise that ToxicChat is a large
distribution shift from BeaverTails-30k, on which
theLoRA-Guard models are trained. We expect
that the examples in the LLaMA-Guard training set
have a similar distribution to those in BeaverTails,
since both datasets are originally constructed from
Anthropic’s Red Team/Helpful-Harmless datasets.
The LLaMA-Guard 3 chat template indicates
that the model should judge the safety of the final
turn in the conversation. Inspecting ToxicChat ex-
amples, we found many with unsafe prompts but
model refusals. We performed the evaluation again
moderating only the prompts in the examples, but
saw only a mild increase in performance. Toxic-
Chat also contains specific jailbreak attempts, but
removing these also did not improve performance.

mitigated by training on an alternative dataset.

when run in conjunction with the corresponding chat model. The performance of all models is relatively poor on
this dataset, with the OpenAI Moderation API being the best. We hypothesise that ToxicChat is a large distribution
shift from the BeaverTails dataset on which the LoRA-Guard models are trained. The performance of LLaMA-Guard

Attacks. Jailbreak attacks have been shown to
effectively generate harmful content (Rao et al.,
2023; Kang et al., 2023). The overarching goal of
a jailbreak attack is to trick the model into ignoring
or deprioritizing its safety mechanisms, opening
the door for the generation fo harmful content.
Simple approaches such as manual prompt-
ing are often effective (walkerspider, 2022; Mow-
showitz, 2022; Witten, 2022; Guzey, 2023; Zeng
et al., 2024). Some example strategies include:
instructing the model to ignore previous instruc-
tions (aimed at circumventing safety instructions
in the system prompt) (Perez and Ribeiro, 2022;
Shen et al., 2023; Schulhoff et al., 2023); asking
the model to start the answer with “ Absolutely!
Here’s ” to condition the generation process to fol-
low a helpful direction (Wei et al., 2024); using
low-resource languages of alternative text modes
such as ciphers, for which pre-training data existsbut safety data may be lacking (Yong et al., 2023;
Barak, 2023; Yuan et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024);
inducing persona modulation or role-playing (Shah
et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023); using an LLM as-
sistant to generate jailbreak prompts (WitchBOT,
2023; Shah et al., 2023); or using iterative prompt
refinement to evade safeguards (Takemoto, 2024;
Russinovich et al., 2024).
More complex approaches involve automatically
generated prompts. Automation can be achieved
through LLM assistants which generate, modify
or optimize prompts for jailbreaking (Chao et al.,
2023; Mehrotra et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023; Yu
et al., 2023). Black-box optimization approaches
rely solely on model outputs. Lapid et al. (2023);
Liu et al. (2023) use genetic algorithms, and Mehro-
tra et al. (2023); Takemoto (2024) use iterative
refinement to optimize adversarial prompts. White-
box optimization approaches assume access to the
target LLM and often rely on gradient information.
Zou et al. (2023) use greedy coordinate gradient
7search to find a prompt suffix that causes LLMs to
produce objectionable content. Zhu et al. (2023)
uses uses a dual-goal attack that is capable of jail-
breaking as well as stealthiness, thus avoiding per-
plexity filters which detect out of distribution text.
In between black-box and white-box there are also
grey-box optimization approaches which use token
probabilities (Andriushchenko et al., 2024; Paulus
et al., 2024).
Defences. In addition to the development of
safety alignment approaches (Ouyang et al., 2022;
Bai et al., 2022b), external defence mecha-
nisms have been proposed to detect undesirable
content—we will refer to these collectively as
guardrails (Markov et al., 2023; Dong et al.,
2024a).
Self-defence is an approach whereby an LLM
is used to evaluate the safety of user-provided
prompts or model-generated responses with an ad-
ditional forward pass (Helbling et al., 2023; Wang
et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). Self-reminders are
pieces of text placed in system prompts which re-
mind LLMs to answer according to safety guide-
lines before answering (Xie et al., 2023). In-context
learning can be used to strengthen defences without
retraining or fine-tuning (Wei et al., 2023; Lin et al.,
2023a; Zhou et al., 2024; Varshney et al., 2023).
Perplexity-based filters are designed to detect jail-
breaks built from out of distribution text (Jain et al.,
2023; Alon and Kamfonas, 2023). Xie et al. (2024)
develep a method to detect unsafe prompts by scru-
tinizing the gradients of safety-critical parameters
in LLMs.
A number of commercial solutions address-
ing safety exist, with varying degree of openness
as to the methods employed, such as: Nvidia’s
NeMo Guardrails (Rebedea et al., 2023), Ope-
nAI’s Moderation API (OpenAI Moderation API,
2024), GuardrailsAI (Rajpal, 2023), Perspective
API (Perspective API, 2024), Protect AI (Protect
AI, 2024), Opaque (Popa and Poddar, 2024) and
Enkrypt AI (Enkrypt AI, 2024).
The closest works to LoRA-Guard are LLaMA-
Guard (Inan et al., 2023) and Self-Guard (Wang
et al., 2023). The LLaMA-Guard is a fine-tune
of LLaMA-2-7B model (Touvron et al., 2023) for
harmful content detection. LLaMA-Guard pro-
vides good performance, but at the cost of running
a 7B guard model in addition to any chat system.
Self-Guard involved fine-tuning the chat model to
review its responses and generate a tag which in-dicates the presence of harmful content. The Self-
Guard is parameter efficient, but modifying the
chat model weights allows for the possibility of
forgetting (Luo et al., 2023).
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning. To address
the increasing computational costs of fully fine-
tuning LLMs, parameter-efficient fine-tuning meth-
ods have been proposed (He et al., 2021; Lialin
et al., 2023). Selective fine-tuning selects a subset
of the model parameters to be fine-tuned (Don-
ahue et al., 2014; Gheini et al., 2021). Prompt
tuning prepends to the model input embeddings a
trainable “soft prompt” tensor (Lester et al., 2021).
Adapters add additional trainable parameters to
existing layers while keeping the original parame-
ters fixed (Houlsby et al., 2019). Low-rank adap-
tation (LoRA) involves adding a small number
of trainable low-rank matrices to (some of) the
model’s weights, without affecting the original
model parameters (Hu et al., 2021). Ladder side-
tuning disentangles the backwards pass of the orig-
inal and new parameters for more efficient back-
propagation (Sung et al., 2022).
7 Conclusion
LoRA-Guard provides guardrails for conversational
systems at a vastly reduced parameter overhead
when compared with standard approaches (100-
1000x fewer in our experiments). Moreover, this
reduction in memory requirements comes without
loss of chat performance and with moderation per-
formance competitive with or surpassing the state
of the art on benchmark tasks. These are due, re-
spectively, to a dual-path design and the knowledge
sharing in parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We con-
sider LoRA-Guard to be an important contribution
to guardrail methods for resource-constrained set-
tings such as on-device LLMs.
Potential Risks Distribution shift presents a risk
to any guardrail system. Harmful content at test-
time which is significantly different from that that
which the model was trained on (e.g., an entirely
new category of harmful content) may bypass
safety filters. This risk can be mitigated by further
work to improve out of distribution generalisation,
for instance on building richer datasets.
8 Limitations
LoRA-Guard requires access to the chat model
weights, so is only applicable in these cases and
8cannot be applied to black-box systems. In addi-
tion, we train LoRA-Guard with a fixed taxonomy
for harm categories (matching those in Beavertails-
30k), so adaptation to different taxonomies would
requires retraining. This is in contrast to LLaMA-
Guard, which in principle can adapt to new tax-
onomies via in-context learning. It is possible to
train a guard model in the LoRA-Guard framework
to have this adaptability. We leave an evaluation of
this to future work.
9 Ethical Considerations
The choice of taxonomy for harmful content
presents an important ethical consideration. The
perceived harm of certain content may vary across
groups or societies, so the taxonomy used must be
customised both to the application and the audi-
ence. We advise caution when deploying general-
purpose guardrails across multiple cultural and de-
mographic groups.
Our method may contribute to a wider adoption
of content-moderated LLMs, in particular enabling
on-device moderation in resource-constrained set-
tings due to the reduction in memory overhead of
the guard model.

A Low Parameter Baselines
In Table 6 we provide results of methods
which use fewer additional guard parameters than
LoRA-Guard . These baselines are designed to indi-
cate whether the additional guard model parameters
in the LoRA adapters provide a benefit. By com-
parison with Table 1 we find that this is indeed the
case. In these results, as with LoRA-Guard , we use
the instruction tuned variants of each the models.
Self Defense The LLM Self Defense approach
was suggested by Phute et al. (2024). We incorpo-
rate the prompt-response pair to be classified into
an instruction prompt with the format shown Fig. 3
This text is them fed to the LLM and the generated
outputs are parsed into a binary prediction. Before
processing the generated text we strip whitespace
and convert to lower case. If the processed output
matches the regex ^yes[^a-zA-Z] then the exam-
ple gets the binary prediction unsafe, if it matches
^no[^a-zA-Z] then the example gets the binary
prediction safe. If the example matches neither pat-
tern then we arbitrarily consider prediction to be
unsafe. The percentage of such examples is 45%
for LLaMA-3.2-1B, 0%for LLaMA-3.2-3B and
19% for LLaMA-3.1-8B. The results are not dra-
matically improved if we consider these examples
as safe.
Output Head Tuning We perform an ablation
study on LoRA-Guard in which we train only the
output head (without any LoRA adaptation) for the
three chat models considered. The training config-
uration is the same as described in Section 4, only

B BeaverTails Harm Categories
This section is copied verbatim from (Ji et al.,
2024, Appendix B), displayed here for readers’
convenience.
Hate Speech, Offensive Language: This cat-
egory encompasses any form of communication
or content that expresses intense hostility or vi-
olence towards an individual or group based on
aspects like race, religion, ethnicity, nationality,
gender, sexual orientation, or any other defining
characteristics. This also includes language that is
considered vulgar, crude, or offensive.
Discrimination, Stereotype, Injustice: Dis-
crimination refers to treating people unfairly or
unequally based on their personal characteristics
or affiliations such as race, age, gender, religion,
etc. Stereotyping involves holding simplified and
generalized beliefs about particular groups, which
often leads to prejudices and discrimination. Injus-
tice pertains to unfair treatment or violation of the
rights of individuals or groups.
Violence, Aiding and Abetting, Incitement:
This involves any form of physical harm, threat,
or violent behavior towards individuals or groups.
Aiding and abetting refers to the act of helping,
supporting, or encouraging such violent behaviors
or illegal activities. Incitement pertains to the act of
provoking or stirring up harmful, violent, or illegal
actions.
Financial Crime, Property Crime, Theft: This
includes all forms of illegal activities that lead to
financial loss such as fraud, embezzlement, money
laundering, bribery, and other forms of corruption.
Property crime and theft involve the act of taking
someone’s property without their consent.
Privacy Violation: This refers to actions that in-
vade an individual’s privacy, such as unauthorized
access, use, disclosure, or collection of personal
data. It also includes stalking, doxing, or any otherform of intrusion into someone’s personal life with-
out their consent.
Drug Abuse, Weapons, Banned Substance:
This category includes the misuse or abuse of ille-
gal drugs, prescription drugs, or any other banned
substances. It also involves the unauthorized or
illegal possession, use, or trade of weapons.
Non-Violent Unethical Behavior: This refers to
any behavior that is morally or ethically wrong but
does not involve violence. Examples can include
dishonest behaviors like lying, cheating, deceiv-
ing, spreading rumors, betraying trust, or any other
form of unethical conduct.
Sexually Explicit, Adult Content: This cat-
egory includes any content that depicts explicit
sexual activities or adult themes that are consid-
ered inappropriate or offensive. This can include
pornography, explicit sexual text or messages, and
any other form of sexually explicit material.
Controversial Topics, Politics: This refers to
discussions or statements related to controversial
topics, political ideologies, or sensitive issues that
could lead to disagreement or conflict. These topics
can be divisive and could potentially cause harm if
not handled respectfully and thoughtfully.
Misinformation Re. ethics, laws, and safety:
This category involves the spreading of incorrect
or misleading information related to ethical issues,
laws, regulations, or any matter related to safety.
Misinformation can cause harm by influencing peo-
ple’s beliefs or actions negatively.
Terrorism, Organized Crime: This pertains to
any form of content or action related to terrorism or
organized crime, including endorsing or promoting
terrorist activities, participating in organized crim-
inal activities, or spreading propaganda for such
groups.
Self-Harm: This includes any form of self-
inflicted harm, whether physical or emotional, or
any content that promotes, glorifies, or encourages
self-harm. This can also include discussions of
suicidal thoughts or plans.

Table 6: Low parameter baseline results on BeaverTails-30k. By comparison with Table 1, we see that the LoRA
adapters provide a benefit for guard model performance. The Output-Head models are trained on BeaverTails-30k but
the Self-Defense ones are not (they are simply an in-context prompt asking if an example is unsafe.) See Appendix A
for details. For each metric, we report the median value across 3 random seeds with the range in parentheses. Size
refers to the parameter overhead of the guard model when run in conjunction with the corresponding chat model.
Animal Abuse: This involves any form of cru-
elty or harm inflicted on animals, including physi-
cal abuse, neglect, or any behavior that causes dis-
tress or harm to an animal. It also includes content
that promotes such behavior.
Child Abuse: This encompasses any form of
physical, emotional, or sexual abuse directed to-
ward children. It can also include neglect, exploita-
tion, or any behavior that harms a child or violates
their rights. Content that promotes or glorifies such
behavior also falls under this category.
