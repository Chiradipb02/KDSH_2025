ABSTRACT
The e-commerce experience has remained largely unchanged for
over two decades, evidenced by the persistent presentation of search
results as simple lists of products and the poor handling of personal-
ization. However, the advent of generative AI promises significant
changes that could redefine the very nature of e-commerce.
One of the primary challenges in e-commerce search is maintain-
ing relevance. This issue is succinctly captured in the phrase, "tail
experience is the head experience," emphasizing the difficulty of
ensuring relevance across a broad spectrum of queries, particularly
those that are new and obscure. Improving relevance using current
technologies requires substantial resources and investment, making
it a significant obstacle for many e-commerce platforms.
Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional ability
to understand natural language, may eventually solve the prob-
lem of query understanding. Beyond interpreting keyword queries,
LLMs facilitate natural language-like interactions and conversa-
tions, making the user experience more intuitive and engaging.
In addition, LLMs also function as powerful product knowledge
graphs, a crucial element that has long been sought in e-commerce
systems.
Moreover, the advent of multimodal foundation models will
enable e-commerce systems to process information from varied
sources such as text, images, videos, and voice. By deeply under-
standing user intent, these models dynamically construct user en-
vironments and interfaces that are not only visually engaging but
also highly tailored to individual preferences and interactions. This
capability represents a significant shift in e-commerce, moving
from static, one-size-fits-all solutions to fluid, responsive, and en-
gaging shopping environments that adapt to and anticipate the
unique needs and desires of each user. In this new era, e-commerce
platforms will offer a level of personalization and engagement that
transforms how users interact with products and services online,
setting a new standard for digital retail experiences.
While LLMs have already brought notable improvements to
e-commerce, particularly in areas such as query understanding,
content presentation, and conversation, the potential of generative
AI and the disruptions it can bring are likely to be even more
profound. In this talk, I will explore four key areas of potential
change:

https://doi.org/10.1145/3637528.3672503Firstly, there is a growing desire for a revolutionary rather than
incremental change to the e-commerce experience, particularly
among a new generation of users. These users seek more than just
transactions; they crave meaningful interactions. The shift from
traditional e-commerce search to TikTok-style engagement is a
step in the right direction, but the potential transformation could
be even more profound. E-commerce shopping could become a
rich, immersive experience as we leverage all channels such as text,
video, audio, and AR/VR to engage with users. It will be reimagined
as a social activity, focusing on pleasant engagement, serendipity,
and community-building, thereby transforming shopping from a
mere necessity into an enjoyable and holistic experience.
Secondly, the fusion of physical and digital shopping is becoming
increasingly prevalent. Innovations such as drone delivery and
AR/VR experiences are creating seamless shopping journeys that
blend the convenience of online shopping with the tangible benefits
of in-person interactions.
Thirdly, the rise of autonomous agents is set to revolutionize
e-commerce. These AI-driven agents, acting on behalf of customers
and sellers, will fundamentally change the dynamics of online busi-
ness: When machines begin shopping on behalf of humans, the
traditional pillars of e-commerce—attention economics and cus-
tomer loyalty—will be challenged. E-commerce platforms will need
to rethink their strategies in a world where autonomous agents
handle most transactions.
Fourthly, the concept of personalized products is gaining trac-
tion. Just as personalized medicine tailors treatments to individual
patients, personalized food and other products can cater to the
specific preferences and needs of consumers, further enhancing the
shopping experience.
In conclusion, the impact of generative AI on e-commerce is
profound. It has significantly improved the understanding of user
intent and serves as a comprehensive product knowledge graph.
However, the most substantial disruptions are yet to come, partic-
ularly through the rise of autonomous agents. In this talk, I will
outline a tentative path toward a future where e-commerce not
only offers an unparalleled customer experience but also thrives in
a world dominated by generative AI and autonomous agents.
