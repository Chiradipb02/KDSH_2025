ABSTRACT
The workshop’s rationale stems from the escalating interest in
causal inference and machine learning methodologies within vari-
ous industrial contexts. This surge in demand underscores the im-
portance for both scholars and practitioners to exchange knowledge
and best practices regarding the application of these techniques to
tackle real-world challenges. Yet, applying causal machine learning
techniques in real-world scenarios presents a range of challenges
not addressed in the academic literature. This workshop aims to
address the challenges for practical causal machine learning and
explore new industry use cases. The workshop will provide a forum
for practitioners and researchers to exchange ideas and explore
new collaborations. Moreover, this workshop aims to capitalize on
the success and achievements of the KDD 2023 Workshop titled
"Causal Inference and Machine Learning in Practice" [1].
