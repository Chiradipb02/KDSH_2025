ABSTRACT
In recent years, there have been exciting and accelerated develop-
ments in AI with novel developments in foundation models, deep
learning, new AI applications across numerous verticals, and more.
In addition, the pace of adoption of these innovations driven by
both academic and industry research labs has sped up with both big
tech companies and startups looking to deliver value-differentiated
products and services. With Generative AI (GenAI) garnering sig-
nificant attention, the second edition of the I2S workshop focuses
on two aspects: First, bringing together AI thought leaders from
academia, big tech, and startups to discuss the opportunities, use-
case themes, challenges, and risks of GenAI in various business
verticals; and Second, bringing together startup founders to share
experiences and lessons learned in commercializing GenAI innova-
tions into successful enterprises highlighting challenges through
the entire commercial journey - from productization to acquiring
customers, building a team, and securing funding.

1 INTRODUCTION
According to Gartner1, the market for artificial intelligence (AI)
software will expand to more than $134 billion by 2025. Both the
pace and scale of investment in AI startups and bringing academic
innovations and advances to market have picked up significantly.
These efforts have also been mirrored at big tech and other large

Foundation (NSF)’s new directorate named Technology, Innovation
and Partnerships (TIP)2to support a similar mission to accelerate
innovation to commercialization have been initiated. In parallel,
industry is increasing efforts around various aspects of AI including
standardization, content provenance, authenticity and security3.
KDD is a premier data science conference that brings researchers
and practitioners from academia and industry together to share
ideas, research results and practical experiences. AI innovations
driven by both academic and industry research labs are happening
at an accelerated pace. In recent years, big tech companies and star-
tups have rapidly productized many state-of-art machine learning
innovations (e.g. large language models, diffusion models, other
types of GenAI models, and more). Industry leaders recognize that
AI will be one of the key ingredients that will drive the next wave
of technology innovations and they need to develop the right AI
strategy for their organizations. The I2S workshop aims to take this
discussion forward with actionable contextualization in bringing
innovation to real-world value.
2 PROGRAM SKETCH (HALF-DAY ∼3 HOURS)
The workshop is designed with several core KDD principles includ-
ing: (1) Fostering a bi-directional dialog between the stakeholders
in the AI ecosystem; (2) Creating mentoring and networking op-
portunities for the KDD community by establishing connections
with VCs and AI startup founders; and (3) Increasing participation
from women, minorities and other underrepresented groups and
empowering them with the access to resources and collaboration
networks that will enable them to be future successful AI leaders
and founders. Given the success of the first workshop, this edition
would continue building the foundation for a multi-year workshop
to addresses this important area for the KDD community.
I2S is a half-day workshop consisting of keynotes, interactive
discussions, and vibrant panel discussions - with expert speakers
from Big Tech, startups and venture capital companies. Speakers
will include successful industry and academic practitioners that
have demonstrated leadership in bridging academic research and

startups, or leaders of Big Tech companies that have led teams
through incredible transformation in applying AI to deliver value-
differentiated products and services.
3PREVIOUS ITERATION OF THE WORKSHOP
From Innovation to Scale (I2S) 2023, our first I2S workshop on taking
AI innovations to market was a big success. The workshop was
over-subscribed with opening keynotes delivered by prominent VCs
and startup founders. The interactive panels had lively discussions
on overcoming key challenges in building, validating, financing,
and scaling AI technologies in market environments.
The workshop provided a valuable chance to share lessons learned
and build connections across the AI community, laying the foun-
dation for an ongoing group focused on turning AI ideas into real-
world success. The excitement and appreciation from the attendees
has been a testament to the utility and relevancy of the workshop
theme and organization.
