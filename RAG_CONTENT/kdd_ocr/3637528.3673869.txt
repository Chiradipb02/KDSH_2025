ABSTRACT
Environmental problems such as air pollution monitoring and pre-
vention, flood detection and prevention, land use, forest manage-
ment, river water quality, wastewater treatment supervision, man-
agement of biodiversity etc. are more complex than typical real-
world problems usually AI faces to. This added complexity rises
from several aspects, such as the randomness shown by most of
environmental processes involved, the 2D/3D nature of involved
problems, the temporal aspects, the spatial aspects, the inexactness
of the information, the multigranularity of the information etc.
In fact, environmental problems belong to the most difficult
problems with a lot of inexactness and uncertainty, and possibly
conflicting objectives to be solved according to several classifica-
tions such as the one by Funtowicz Ravetz (Funtowicz Ravetz,
1999), which states that there are 3 kinds of problems. Also, they
are non-structured problems in the classification proposed by H.
Simon (Simon, 1966).
All this complexity means that to effectively solve those problems
a lot of knowledge is needed. This knowledge can be theoretical
knowledge expressed in mechanistic models, such as the Gravid-
ity Newton’s Theory, or it can be empirical knowledge that can
be expressed by means of empirical models, originated by some
data and observations (data-driven knowledge) or by the expertise
gathered by people when coping with such problems (model-driven
knowledge, particularly expert-based knowledge).
The KDD 2024 Special Day for AI for environment brings to-
gether researchers and practitioners to present their perspective
on this very timely topic on how AI can be used for good, and
improving the environment where we all live in.
