ABSTRACT
Independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data is essential to
many data analysis and modeling techniques. In the medical do-
main, collecting data from multiple sites or institutions is a common
strategy that guarantees sufficient clinical diversity, determined
by the decentralized nature of medical data. However, data from
various sites are easily biased by the local environment or facilities,
thereby violating the i.i.d. rule. A common strategy is to harmonize
the site bias while retaining important biological information. The
ComBat is among the most popular harmonization approaches
and has recently been extended to handle distributed sites. How-
ever, when faced with situations involving newly joined sites in
training or evaluating data from unknown/unseen sites, ComBat
lacks compatibility and requires retraining with data from all the
sites. The retraining leads to significant computational and logistic
overhead that is usually prohibitive. In this work, we develop a
novel Cluster ComBat harmonization algorithm, which leverages
cluster patterns of the data in different sites and greatly advances
the usability of ComBat harmonization. We use extensive simula-
tion and real medical imaging data from ADNI to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed approach. Our codes are provided in

1 INTRODUCTION
The recent advances in machine learning approaches have greatly
advanced biomedical data analysis. In brain imaging analysis, for
example, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been used for the
detection and disease progression of many diseases, such as Mild
Cognitive Impairment (MCI) [ 41,55–57], Parkinson’s disease [ 12],
and Brain Tumor Detection [ 1]. However, one critical challenge
with brain imaging is that the brain imaging is sensitive to scanner
or protocol effect [ 30,52], also commonly referred to as site effect
or batch effect, leading to the fact that brain imaging from multiple
sites is not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). The bias
in non-i.i.d. data will cause unstable prediction performance and
poor generalization performance to unseen data [ 49]. Consequently,
developing an algorithm that can eliminate these types of bias
ensures consistent and reliable outcomes in the deployment of
machine learning models within the medical imaging domain.
ComBat [21] is a well-known harmonization technique and has
been shown to be helpful in mitigating the site effect of neuroimag-
ing data introduced by multiple sites sampling [ 28]. Despite its
utility, one of the central ideas is that ComBat debias the site effect
independently according to the (local) site data, which induces one
critical limitation, its inability to evaluate site effects coming from
unseen or unknown sites without undergoing a retraining process.
The requirement of retraining is hindered by substantial compu-
tational costs when it comes to real-world deployment, especially
when dealing with large datasets from multiple sites. This limitation
underscores the need for a more efficient and broadly applicable
approach in mitigating the site effects of medical data, especially
neuroimaging data.
Furthermore, a centralized setting for site effect harmonization
introduces extra concerns. For instance, sharing data directly among
multiple sites to apply ComBat harmonization poses challenges
to the security of confidential data and the protection of patient
privacy. Direct training on all the data is often impractical in the
medical domain. This underscores the need to develop harmoniza-
tion algorithms in a decentralized manner that can effectively har-
monize without gathering data from all sites while maintaining

competitive performance in the centralized setting. Particularly,
the Distributed ComBat [ 6], a distributed version of the ComBat
harmonization algorithm, has demonstrated its harmonization ca-
pability meanwhile obeying decentralized manners. Nevertheless,
Distributed ComBat suffers from the same limitation as the orig-
inalComBat, i.e., it cannot estimate site effects from unseen sites
without retraining.
Because a significant part of site effects in medical data are ul-
timately rooted in medical instruments, e.g., MRI scanners from
different manufacturers and configurations, the bias underneath
the sites may not be independent and may exhibit clustering struc-
tures. In this paper, we proposed the Cluster ComBat method, an
extension of the original ComBat algorithms that leverages the
cluster patterns of site effects. This approach enables the estima-
tion of site effects from unknown sites without necessitating a
retraining process. Furthermore, we also developed a distributed
version Cluster ComBat and demonstrated its efficacy in harmoniz-
ing data obeying decentralized manners. Our empirical findings
show that Cluster ComBat in both centralized and decentralized
settings outperform their respective counterparts on both synthetic
and real-world neuroimaging datasets.
2 RELATED WORKS
Brain Imaging. The integration of brain imaging and machine
learning has drawn significant attention in recent research, with
a focus on advancing diagnostic capabilities and understanding
complex neurological conditions [ 26,37]. Recent research advance-
ments highlight the potential of machine learning techniques in
exploring underlying complex patterns within neuroimaging data.
For example, T1-weighted MRI with Lasso Regression, a statis-
tical technique [ 39], has proven effective in detecting MCI [ 41].
Their findings show promising results in the early detection of
MCI, emphasizing the significance of early intervention and treat-
ment. Furthermore, complicated deep learning architectures, such
as YOLOv7 [ 40], have also demonstrated exceptional predictive
performance in brain tumor detection using T1-weighted MRI [ 1].
Besides, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) also shows valuable infor-
mation related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology and achieves
promising performance in the diagnosis and progression modeling
of AD using machine learning classification [42, 43, 53, 54].
Distributed Learning. Preserving the privacy of users’ informa-
tion is a crucial issue that needs to be considered as an important
aspect to evaluate in a learning algorithm [ 11,17,18,22,47]. Es-
pecially in a healthcare setting, where the health data is sensitive,
we need to design a distributed learning approach that avoids leak-
ing any private information from hospitals’ data [ 14,44–46]. For
example, for brain imaging, federated learning, a distributed ma-
chine learning algorithm, has proven to be effective in analyzing
neuroimaging for cognitive detection tasks while still protecting
patients’ information [ 8,33]. Moreover, for health records data, to
avoid sharing raw data between sites, the use of first-order and
second-order gradients of the likelihood function of sites has been
shown to be sufficient for achieving high accuracy in classification
tasks [ 9]. In addition, the distributed version of generalized linear
mixed models (GLMM) can also achieve nearly identical resultsin analyzing electronic health records data as in a centralized set-
ting [ 48]. Relating to harmonization methods in a decentralized set-
ting, Distributed ComBat [ 6] and Federated Learning ComBat [ 36]
have been developed to harmonize neuroimaging without the need
for sharing information between hospitals.
ComBat Harmonization. ComBat harmonization, initially de-
signed for applications in bioinformatics and genomics, is an ef-
fective strategy in mitigating batch effects or site effects within
high-dimensional data [ 21]. It has been adopted to address various
situations and problems [ 2]. Fully Bayesian ComBat [ 32] investi-
gates the advantage of using Monte Carlo sampling for statistical
inference in harmonization algorithms. ComBat-GAM [ 31] extends
the model’s capability by also estimating non-linear effects that
came from biological covariates, in contrast to only linear effects
considered in the original ComBat model. Longitudinal ComBat [ 3]
is designed for datasets collected over multiple time points from
the same subjects, effectively taking into account variations within
each subject over time and considering changes in linear covariates.
To preserve the privacy of brain imaging across multiple hospi-
tals or sites, Distributed ComBat [ 6] introduces a decentralized
learning version of the original ComBat, which can also harmonize
data in decentralized settings. Combining the strengths of ComBat-
GAM and Distributed ComBat, Federated Learning ComBat [ 36]
not only estimates non-linear effects from biological covariates but
also utilizes the FedAvg algorithm [ 25] to protect the privacy of
data. However, they are not applicable in large-scale studies when
new sites join the analysis after the harmonization (e.g., [ 34,38]).
3 METHODS
3.1 Preliminary: ComBat Harmonization
ComBat [21] adjusts the location (mean) and scale (variance) of
data from different sites for the requirement of downstream analysis
tasks. Assume given a dataset with 𝐺features collected from 𝑀
different sites. For each site 𝑖∈ [𝑀], there are𝑁𝑖samples, and
𝑁=Í
𝑖∈[𝑀]𝑁𝑖is the total number of samples. ComBat follows
an L/S model assuming that, for each sample 𝑗∈[𝑁𝑖]on site𝑖, the
value of𝑔∈[𝐺]feature𝑦𝑖 𝑗𝑔can be modeled as:
𝑦𝑖 𝑗𝑔=𝛼𝑔+𝑋𝑖 𝑗𝛽𝑔+𝛾𝑖𝑔+𝛿𝑖𝑔𝜖𝑖 𝑗𝑔, (1)
where𝛼𝑔is the mean value of that feature, 𝑋𝑖 𝑗is the biological
covariates (e.g., age, sex), and 𝛽𝑔is the regression coefficient of 𝑋𝑖 𝑗.
𝛾𝑔represents additive effects from site 𝑖, while𝛿𝑔represents the
corresponding multiplicative effects. Also, the error term 𝜖𝑖 𝑗𝑔is
assumed to be drawn from a Normal distribution N(0,𝜎2𝑔). We call
these site-wise effect parameters as harmonization parameters.
The L/S model assumes that different sites would have differ-
entsite effects on their own data. Thus, removing both additive
and multiplicative effects from data within each site is manda-
tory for the later regression task. The empirical Bayes algorithm
is typically used to estimate these harmonization parameters in
ComBat-related approaches [21, 31].
First, ComBat standardizes the data feature-wise:
𝑍𝑖 𝑗𝑔=𝑦𝑖 𝑗𝑔−ˆ𝛼𝑔−𝑋𝑖 𝑗ˆ𝛽𝑔
ˆ𝜎𝑔, (2)
5106Distributed Harmonization: Federated Clustered Batch Effect Adjustment and Generalization KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
where ˆ𝜎2𝑔=1
𝑁Í
𝑖 𝑗(𝑦𝑖 𝑗𝑔−ˆ𝛼𝑔−𝑋𝑖 𝑗ˆ𝛽𝑔−ˆ𝛾𝑖𝑔)2, and ˆ𝛼𝑔,ˆ𝛽𝑔,ˆ𝛾𝑖𝑔are
estimated using feature-wise ordinary least-squares approach.
Then, given distribution assumptions 𝑍𝑖 𝑗𝑔∼N(𝛾𝑖𝑔,𝛿2
𝑖𝑔),𝛾𝑖𝑔∼
N(𝛾𝑖,𝜏2

𝑖𝑔∼InverseGamma(𝜆𝑖,𝜃𝑖), using empirical Bayes

𝑖𝑔)+ˆ𝛼𝑔+𝑋𝑖 𝑗ˆ𝛽𝑔. (4)
3.2 Cluster ComBat
Though ComBat has been widely adopted for various analyses [ 3,
31], it lacks generalization to new sites. When applied to an unseen
site,ComBat requires re-estimating all harmonization parameters
based on𝑀+1sites, which needs to engage all participating sites to
coordinate harmonization, which is costly and usually prohibitive.
Also, the original ComBat assumes that scale and mean effects
exist within each single site, and each group of harmonization
parameters (i.e., 𝛾𝑖𝑔and𝛿𝑖𝑔with the same 𝑖) can only be estimated
within each single site of limited sample size, which may lead to
suboptimal estimation of harmonization parameters.
Instead of assuming harmonization parameters can only be
shared within each single site, we assume that multiple sites can
share one group of harmonization parameters. As such, data points
from multiple sites sharing the same harmonization parameters can
be clustered into one cluster. We thus reformulate the L/S model as:
𝑦𝑖 𝑗𝑔=𝛼𝑔+𝑋𝑖 𝑗𝛽𝑔+𝛾𝑐𝑔+𝛿𝑐𝑔𝜖𝑖 𝑗𝑔, (5)
where𝑐∈[𝐶]represents the cluster index of site 𝑖, and there are 𝐶
clusters in total, where 𝐶≤𝑀. Compared with the original version
of ComBat, where we need to estimate 𝐺·𝑀harmonization param-
eters, this cluster-based algorithm only requires the estimation of
𝐺·𝐶harmonization parameters.
Using cluster-wise shared harmonization parameters, we can
generalize knowledge from previous 𝑁sites to the new unseen site
once we know which cluster each data point from this site belongs
to. Additionally, the estimation process of harmonization parame-
ters𝛾𝑐𝑔and𝛿𝑐𝑔can benefit from multiple sites’ data points within
the same cluster, considering the sample number for estimating
each parameter group is enlarged. And we name this algorithm
Cluster ComBat.
The Cluster ComBat algorithm requires the following steps for
harmonization: i) sample clustering using 𝐾-means, based on
data points from all sites, to decide data points’ cluster index of each
site; ii) feature-wise standardization on all samples using ˆ𝛼𝑔,ˆ𝛽𝑔
and ˆ𝜎𝑔from least-squares; iii) empirical Bayes estimation of the
cluster-wise harmonization parameters 𝛾𝑐𝑔and𝛿𝑐𝑔for each cluster
based on sites within cluster 𝑐∈[𝐶], following Equation 3 with
replacing𝑁𝑖to the overall sample number in cluster 𝑐; iv) har-
monization process following Equation 4 with replacing 𝛾∗

each training sample, we directly apply sample-wise index assign-
ment using the clustering algorithm, allowing data points at the
same site to have different cluster indexes. This is the "privilege"
of the centralized setting, as we can access the feature values of
all data from all sites, thereby facilitating the determination of the
cluster index for each individual data point. This also allows the
cluster index of data points to ignore site belonging, considering
the reduction of bias not only from sites but also from other poten-
tial factors, leading to better handling of data heterogeneity. The
complete process is demonstrated in Algorithm 1.
Now, we introduce how proposed Cluster ComBat can apply
harmonization to the unseen site 𝑖∉[𝑀]. We first use the trained
K-means to identify the cluster of each data point 𝑦𝑖 𝑗, denoted as
𝑘(𝑦𝑖 𝑗). Then, with pre-estimated harmonization parameters 𝛿∗𝑐𝑔,
𝛾∗𝑐𝑔, we can derive the harmonized features for this unseen site 𝑖by
𝑦∗
𝑖 𝑗𝑔=ˆ𝜎𝑔
𝛿∗
˜𝑐𝑔(𝑍𝑖 𝑗𝑔−𝛾∗
˜𝑐𝑔)+ˆ𝛼𝑔+𝑋𝑖 𝑗ˆ𝛽𝑔, (6)
where ˜𝑐=𝑘(𝑦𝑖 𝑗). Algorithm 2 describes the procedure when deal-
ing with data from an unseen site in the centralized setting.
3.3 Distributed Cluster ComBat
In the real-world scenario, large-scale analyses often involve med-
ical data from multiple institutions (e.g., [ 34]). The data is often
stored in distributed data centers by various data owners, and raw
data cannot be transferred to other locations or directly accessed
by other institutions (i.e., sites) due to privacy concerns and regula-
tions. Thus, centralized algorithms like ComBat cannot be directly
applied. Though previous work [ 6] has made an effort to design a
distributed version of ComBat, it would face the same problem as
ComBat when it comes to the unseen new site.
5107KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Bao Hoang et al.
To this end, we propose Distributed Cluster ComBat, extending
Cluster ComBat by enabling its generalization ability to the unseen
site, attributed to the cluster-wise harmonization model. However,
unlike sample-feature clustering in a centralized setting as shown
in Section 3.2, we perform clustering on locally estimated feature-
wise parameters, e.g., 𝛼𝑖𝑔,𝛽𝑖𝑔, and𝛾𝑖𝑔, to tackle the inaccessibility
of raw samples on other sites. The intuition is that if the feature
data of sites exhibit a cluster pattern, locally estimated feature-
wise parameters will also exhibit the same cluster pattern, which
is validated through our simulation studies. Also, the clustering
cost is reduced significantly in the distributed version, considering
clustering only on 𝑀parameter vectors with 𝑀≪𝑁.
The Distributed Cluster ComBat has the following steps: i) each
site estimates feature-wise parameters ˆ𝛼𝑖𝑔,ˆ𝛽𝑖𝑔, and ˆ𝛾𝑖𝑔locally at the
same time, and sends parameters to the central server; ii) the cen-
tral server performs K-means clustering based on ˆ𝛼𝑖𝑔,ˆ𝛽𝑖𝑔, and ˆ𝛾𝑖𝑔
for𝑖∈[𝑀]; iii) the central server aggregates {ˆ𝛼𝑖𝑔}𝑖∈𝑀,{ˆ𝛽𝑖𝑔}𝑖∈𝑀
and{ˆ𝛾𝑖𝑔}𝑖∈𝑀to estimates the global feature-wise parameters ˆ𝛼𝑔,
ˆ𝛽𝑔and ˆ𝛾𝑖𝑔, and then sends back to each site; iv) each site stan-
dardized the local data using global feature-wise parameters, then
locally estimates ˆ𝛿𝑖𝑔and ˆ𝛾𝑖𝑔; v) each site sends locally estimated
harmonization parameters to the server; vi) server aggregates har-
monization parameters within each cluster to estimate the cluster-
wise ones, then sends back to each site; the aggregation procedure
precisely follows the procedure outlined in Figure 1 of the original
Distributed ComBat algorithm paper [ 6]; vii) each site performs
local harmonization based on cluster-wise harmonization parame-
ters. The procedure is summarized in Algorithm 3.
When generalized to new unseen site 𝑖∉[𝑀], we first estimate
the local feature-wise parameters 𝛼𝑖𝑔,𝛽𝑖𝑔and𝛾𝑖𝑔, then use previous
trained K-means model 𝑘to find the cluster index of the current site
based on local estimated feature-wise parameters. Others follow a
similar procedure as Cluster ComBat, as summarized in Algorithm 4.
4 VALIDATION USING SIMULATION
In simulation, we use controllable synthetic data to validate the
correctness of the proposed algorithms and the intuitions used.
4.1 Synthetic data generation
We follow the data generation procedure in [ 36] and use the graph-
ical model in Figure 1. We replace the site effects with the cluster
effects𝛾𝑐𝑔. Specifically, the value 𝑦𝑖 𝑗𝑔with feature index 𝑔, site
index𝑖, and data point index 𝑗is considered as 𝑦𝑖 𝑗𝑔∼N(𝛼𝑔+
𝑋𝑖 𝑗𝛽𝑔+𝛾𝑐𝑔,𝛿2𝑐𝑔𝜎2𝑔). Note that feature values with index 𝑔that are
from different sites but in the same cluster will be affected by the
same cluster effects 𝛾𝑐𝑔and𝛿𝑐𝑔. The ground truth of the harmo-
nized feature for 𝑦𝑖 𝑗𝑔(expected feature value after harmonization)
is𝛼𝑔+𝑋𝑖 𝑗𝛽𝑔. Besides, we induce the task binary label information
into the biological covariate 𝑋𝑖 𝑗. For instance, 𝑋𝑖 𝑗∼N( 0.5,0.5)and
𝑋𝑖 𝑗∼N(− 0.5,0.5)imply positive and negative labels, respectively,
so that the ground truth data is linearly separated. To visualize
the site pattern, cluster pattern, and label pattern in the synthetic
data, Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce
the dimension of the data to 2 [ 24]. Figure 2a and Figure 2b are
examples of visualizing the raw (unharmonized) data, which show
the patterns of site, cluster, and downstream task labels.Algorithm 3 Distributed Cluster ComBat

4.2 Synthetic data experiment
We first verify our motivation that if the feature values of sites
exhibit cluster patterns in the feature space, then locally estimated
feature-wise parameters will also exhibit the same cluster pattern
in the parameter space. We generated synthetic data points for 9
sites within 3 clusters for cluster visualization (with data configu-
ration that the number of sites, sample per site, feature, sites per
cluster, and biological covariate are 9, 10, 20, 3, and 5 respectively).
Specifically, sites 1, 2, and 3 are in the same cluster, sites 4, 5, and 6
are in the same cluster, and sites 7, 8, and 9 are in the same cluster.
We used PCA to reduce the dimension to 2 and visualize data points
of all sites in the feature space as well as the locally trained param-
eters for each site in the parameter space. We use colored circles to
show the cluster pattern in both feature space and parameter space.
As demonstrated in Figure 3, sites within the same cluster in the
feature space (as shown in Figure 3a) can also be clustered into the
same cluster in the parameter space (as shown in Figure 3b). This
indicates that cluster patterns in the feature space can be retained
in the parameter space, which verifies our motivation.

Then, we verify the efficacy of our algorithm over ComBat in
both centralized and distributed settings using synthetic data. We
generate five synthetic data sets, which follow the graphical model
Figure 1 with different parameter configurations. The detailed gen-
eration configurations are summarized in Table 1. We assess the per-
formance of Cluster ComBat harmonization and original ComBat
algorithms on the synthetic data with aforementioned conditions
over two tasks: ground-truth data, i.e., 𝛼𝑔+𝑋𝑖 𝑗𝛽𝑔, reconstruction
task and ground-truth label classification tasks. Specifically, the
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the ground-truth data
and the harmonized test data is proposed as the performance mea-
sure of the reconstruction task. Also, task accuracy is naturally
selected as the performance measure of the downstream classifica-
tion task. Because the original ComBat and Distributed ComBat
cannot harmonize data from unseen sites, we will retrain harmo-
nization parameters whenever they have data from a testing site.
Meanwhile, our proposed Cluster ComBat andDistributed Cluster
ComBat can harmonize testing data without the need for retraining
theComBat algorithm. In the experiment, we divided the synthetic
data into 70% for training and 30% for testing for each task and
reported the mean and variance of performance measures over 30
random seeds. The results are summarized in Table 2. The results
show that Cluster ComBat andDistributed Cluster ComBat outper-
form ComBat and Distributed ComBat in both tasks over various
data conditions.
Besides, Figure 4 is an example of demonstrating the site pattern
and cluster pattern after harmonization (with data configuration
that the number of sites, sample per site, feature, sites per cluster,
and biological covariate are 12, 20, 20, 3 and 10 respectively). We see
that both harmonization methods maintain the task label informa-
tion, but the site information has been largely erased. We want to
reiterate that the original ComBat, both in centralized or decentral-
ized settings, requires the retraining procedure when harmonizing
the testing data. On the contrary, the proposed Cluster ComBat
eliminates the requirement, benefiting from our parameter-free
cluster procedure on unseen data.
5 VALIDATION ON BRAIN IMAGING
5.1 ADNI Data

We extracted regional measures from DTI data, following the pro-
cedure in [ 27], leading to 228 features from each scan. We also con-
struct a set of downstream prediction tasks, including the prediction
of a set of ADNI-defined indicators derived from the neuropsycho-
logical battery to characterize memory, executive function, and
language. Specifically: 1) MEM: The ADNI-Mem composite score
for memory, which is based on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning
task, word list learning and recognition tasks from ADAS-Cog, re-
call from Logical Memory I of the Wechsler Memory Test–Revised,
and the 3-word recall item from the MMSE [ 7]. 2) EXF: ADNI-EF
composite score for executive function, including Category Flu-
ency (i.e., animals and vegetables), Trail-Making Test parts A and B,
Digit Span Backwards, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Revised
Digit–Symbol Substitution, and 5 Clock Drawing items [ 13]. 3) LAN:
ADNI-Lan indicator, which is a composite measure of language [ 13].
We also include changes in these scores from baselines [ 16], denoted
by MEM SLOPES, EXF SLOPES, and LAN SLOPES, respectively.
Later, we use these six target variables to evaluate regression per-
formance in downstream tasks. The characteristic distribution of
the ADNI dataset is illustrated in Table 3.Table 3: Characteristic Distribution of ADNI dataset

5.2 Site and Cluster Effects in Brain Imaging
We first show that site effect and cluster effect do exist in ADNI
imaging data. We perform two classification tasks on brain imaging:
i) site classification, and ii) cluster classification. For both tasks, the
inputs are the raw feature values of the brain imaging samples, and
the output labels are the site index for the site classification task
and the cluster index for the cluster classification task. We show
that harmonization (both ComBat andCluster ComBat ) makes it
difficult to distinguish samples from different sites/clusters, i.e.,
lower site/cluster classification accuracy after harmonization.
For site classification, the site index is a sample’s natural site
index, and the overall class number is 18. For cluster classification,
we perform K-means to cluster 18 sites into 5 clusters to assign
cluster indexes, and thus the overall class number is 5. Specifically,
samples with the same cluster indexes can come from the same site
or different sites, while samples with different cluster indexes must
come from different sites. Logistic Regression is used for both tasks
to classify brain imaging. For the train/test split of both tasks, we
randomly select 70%of brain imaging as the training set and the
remaining 30%for the testing set. The test accuracy results of both
tasks are averaged over 100 runs with different random seeds.
Table 4 shows that logistic regression achieves high test accu-
racy on unharmonized DTI imaging for both tasks. By applying
either ComBat orCluster ComBat harmonization, the test accuracy
drops significantly, indicating that either harmonization method
makes it harder for the classifier to distinguish between different
sites/clusters. This shows that both site/cluster effects on real brain
imaging and harmonization methods can alleviate these effects.
We also notice that Cluster ComBat has higher accuracy compared
with ComBat in site classification with similar accuracy in cluster
classification. This can be explained as that after removing cluster

effect based on cluster-wise harmonization parameters, differences
between clusters are removed by Cluster ComBat, while site dif-
ferences still exist among sites within the same cluster. Thus, it
is still possible to differentiate between sites within each cluster
even after harmonization in Cluster ComBat case. This shows that
our assumption for cluster-wise harmonization works well on real
brain imaging data.
Furthermore, we visualize the distributions of DTI imaging fea-
tures with or without harmonization. We perform the supervised
dimension reduction technique Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
using site/cluster index as the target variable to reduce 228-dim
DTI features to a lower dimensional space with only 2 dimensions.
Figure 6 presents the result using site index as the target variable
for site effect visualization, and Figure 5 presents the result using
cluster index as the target variable for cluster effect visualization.
For cluster effect visualization in Figure 5, we only colored data
samples by cluster index. As shown in Figure 5a, data without har-
monization reveals a clear distinguishable cluster pattern, especially
for cluster 3 and cluster 4, and samples of each cluster are centered
around their own cluster centroid. This indicates that cluster effect
does exist in DTI imaging. In both Figure 5b and 5c, the distribution
of samples presents more like a single spherical shape, and differ-
ent clusters overlap with each other after harmonization, which
makes it harder to distinguish one from others compared with the
unharmonized result. This suggests that harmonization methods
effectively removed the cluster effect from raw DTI data.
For site effect visualization, we only show distributions of cluster
1 and cluster 4 for demonstration. And we color the same site-
index-based LDA visualization1using different coloring strategies,
for a better understanding of relations between site and cluster
effect in Cluster ComBat : the left column figures (Figure 6a, 6c) are
colored by site index, while the right column figures (Figure 6b,
6d) are colored by cluster index. By comparing Figure 6a and 6b,
we can know that both site effect and cluster effect are evident
in unharmonized data, as distinct separation is observed between
sites and clusters. By comparing Figure 6b and 6d, we verify that
ourCluster ComBat does remove cluster effect, as cluster 1 and
cluster 4 overlap with each other after harmonization. Then, by
coloring samples in the same cluster differently based on site index,
as shown in Figure 6c, we find that cluster 1 consists of site 3, 6, 9
and 12. Though site 6 and 12 overlap with each other, site 3, 6 and
9 are clearly separated from each other. Similar to cluster 4, site
1 and 8 show obvious disparity with each other. To conclude, our
Cluster ComBat removes differences over clusters while preserving
possible site differences within the cluster, which is also verified in
higher site classification accuracy than ComBat in Table 4.

5.3 Downstream Regression Performance
For real data, we do not have the ground truth of harmonization,
so our focus is on evaluating the performance of harmonization al-
gorithms through downstream tasks. In these tasks, we use the 228
features of DTI brain imaging to predict the MEM, MEM SLOPES,
EXF, EXF SLOPES, LAN, and LAN SLOPES variables. We build a
simple Linear Regression model using the Scikit-Learn library [ 29]
to train the regression task on the target target variables. For Com-
Batand Distributed ComBat, we retrain parameters as described in
Section 4.2. We split the 18 sites into 12 training sites and 6 testing
sites, then run experiments 100 times with different combinations
of train and test sites. To evaluate performance, we compute the
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the linear regression’s outputs on
the testing site’s data and target testing labels. In a centralized set-
ting, we also compared our method with the Generalized Linear
Squares Approach [ 41], an algorithm designed to eliminate con-
founding effects. This approach assumes that a variable may be
linearly dependent on the confounding variables, and these effects
can be removed by solving a linear regression optimization prob-
lem. Results in Table 5 show that our proposed method performs
better than ComBat and Generalized Linear Squares Approach in
5111KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Bao Hoang et al.
a centralized setting and Distributed ComBat in a decentralized
setting for most downstream tasks.
5.4 Additional Empirical Studies
Time complexity efficiency. To demonstrate that our proposed
Cluster ComBat does show better time efficiency compared with
ComBat in both centralized and decentralized settings, we provide
an empirical comparison of computation time. We evaluated the
average running time (in seconds) for predicting MEM regression
results using the ADNI dataset in 100 experiments. As shown in
Table 7, Cluster ComBat consistently outperforms the original Com-
Bat in terms of running time, 2×faster in the centralized setting
and4×faster in the decentralized setting.
Number of Clusters. We investigate the impact of the number of
clusters (𝑘) for K-means on both Cluster ComBat andDistributed
Cluster ComBat. We conduct the same downstream tasks experi-
ments as described in Section 5.3 with different numbers of clusters
for the K-means algorithm, specifically 3,5,7,and9. Average perfor-
mances are reported in Table 6. As observed in Table 6, variations in
the number of clusters ( 𝑘) do not significantly affect the regression
performance across 100different random seed experiments for all
six target variables. This indicates that our Cluster ComBat methods
are stable among different numbers of clusters.
Limited Sample Size Per Sites. One advantage of our proposed
methods is that they can still harmonize data even in limited sample
sizes at each site. This is attributed to the fact that we have larger
samples in clusters instead of individual sites. We investigated this
by restricting the selection to a maximum number of samples at
each site, such as 10,20,40,60. We performed a regression task over
the EXF variable, and the average performance of 100 experiments
is reported in Table 8. We see that when the sample size is limited
to10,ComBat fails to harmonize. However, our proposed Cluster
ComBat still achieves comparable regression performance without
harmonization. For maximum sample sizes per site of 20,40,60, our
proposed method consistently outperforms the baseline ComBat.
Important Feature Before and After Harmonization. For re-
gression tasks, we compute 𝑝-values for linear regression across
228 features in DTI imaging. The final 𝑝-values are obtained by
averaging over 100 different random seeds. A feature is important
if its𝑝-value is less than 0.05. Table 9 displays the number of impor-
tant features for the linear regression across 3 target variables MEM,
EXF, and LAN. The table indicates that by using Cluster ComBat, we
achieve comparable performance with fewer significant features..
This suggests that without harmonization and ComBat, the model
may have included too many false positive features.
In addition to 𝑝-values, another measure of feature importance
is provided by the linear regression coefficients. The magnitude
of the coefficient indicates the importance of a feature. Similar
to the approach used for deriving final 𝑝-values, we compute the
average of linear regression coefficients across experiments. Our
findings highlight the significant involvement of multiple fiber
tracts, such as the fornix(cres)-stria terminalis, superior fronto-
occipital fasciculus, corpus callosum, and fornix, in three cognitive
tasks: MEM (memory), LAN (language), and EXF (emotion), which
are consistent with existing literature [ 5,10,20,23,35,50]. Figure 7
visualizes the details of fiber tracts for each cognitive task.

Figure 7: Important Feature Visualization. The left fornix
(cres)-stria terminalis and the right superior fronto-occipital
fasciculus play a role in MEM. In EXF, the involvement in-
cludes the left fornix (cres)-stria terminalis and the full cor-
pus callosum on both sides. For LAN, the engagement extends
to the bilateral fornix, full corpus callosum, and bilateral
fornix (cres)-stria terminalis. The color in the figure serves
solely to distinguish the Regions of Interest (ROIs).
6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
ComBat has been the standard protocol for harmonization batch ef-
fects for various biomedical data analyses, and yet current ComBat
implementations and variants cannot handle new/unseen sites, once
the harmonization is done. In this paper, we developed a novel Clus-
ter ComBat and a distributed variant Distributed Cluster ComBat to
perform privacy-aware harmonization over distributed data sources
and handle generalization to data in unseen sites/institutions after
the harmonization is completed. Our proposed approach is largely
aligned with existing harmonization protocols and can be easily
adapted to extend harmonization to large-scale, multi-site data
analyses and greatly reduce the logistic overhead of initiating dis-
tributed computing when new sites continuously join analyses. We
believe this approach can greatly advance data-driven scientific
research in multi-institutional studies, especially in the medical
and biomedical domains. For example, the research activities [ 34]
in ENIGMA Neuroimaging Consortium [ 38] can greatly benefit
from this research when new institutions join the consortium and
participate in existing studies.
We conducted extensive validation on both synthetic data real
brain imaging data from ADNI in both centralized and decentralized
settings. We demonstrated through both qualitative and quantita-
tive studies that our methods effectively remove cluster-wise effects
from brain imaging data. Then, our methods exhibit superior per-
formance on downstream regression tasks compared to baseline
harmonization methods in both centralized and decentralized set-
tings, which further validates the efficacy of our harmonized data.
We also showed that our methods can use much fewer significant

Regarding deploying our proposed method, we consider 3 im-
plementation consideration aspects: 1) ML-framework agnostic:
Our algorithm doesn’t involve any specific ML frameworks in the
local computation part, so it is easy to implement in many systems
regardless of the local ML framework. Flower [ 4] can be a candidate
choice. For downstream tasks after harmonization, like regression
or other ML models, the choice of local ML framework can be flex-
ible depending on local preference. 2) Security communication:
Designed for medical records, the deployment system needs to have
communication security to prevent privacy leakage. One possible
choice is to encrypt the communication between the clients and the
server, for example, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) [ 15] or Transport
Layer Security (TLS) [ 19]. 3) Scalable and light-weight: Since our
algorithm’s main benefit lies in new clients joining the federated
system, the system deployment should be scalable. To be more spe-
cific, when new clients join in, there should be minimum system
configuration modification on the server as well as for old clients.
Also, the implementation of our algorithm needs to be lightweight,
and the FL system with our algorithm should require limited system
consumption. And the design of FedLab [ 51] can be a reference to
meet these requirements. As a future work, we will deploy our pro-
posed Cluster ComBat harmonization in the ENIGMA Consortium
toolbox to further validate existing studies.
