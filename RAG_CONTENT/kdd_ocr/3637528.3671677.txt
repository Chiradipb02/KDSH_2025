ABSTRACT
This paper addresses the problem of partial multi-label learning
(PML), a challenging weakly supervised learning framework, where
each sample is associated with a candidate label set comprising both
ground-true labels and noisy labels. We theoretically reveal that an
increased number of noisy labels in the candidate label set leads to
an enlarged generalization error bound, consequently degrading
the classification performance. Accordingly, the key to solving PML
lies in accurately removing the noisy labels within the candidate
label set. To achieve this objective, we leverage prior knowledge
about the noisy labels in PML, which suggests that they only exist
within the candidate label set and possess binary values. Specifically,
we propose a constrained regression model to learn a PML classifier
and select the noisy labels. The constraints of the model strictly
enforce the location and value of the noisy labels. Simultaneously,
the supervision information provided by the candidate label set is
unreliable due to the presence of noisy labels. In contrast, the non-
candidate labels of a sample precisely indicate the classes to which
the sample does not belong. To aid in the selection of noisy labels,
we construct a competitive classifier based on the non-candidate
labels. The PML classifier and the competitive classifier form a com-
petitive relationship, encouraging mutual learning. We formulate
the proposed model as a discrete optimization problem to effec-
tively remove the noisy labels, and we solve it using an alternative
algorithm. Extensive experiments conducted on 6 real-world partial
multi-label data sets and 7 synthetic data sets, employing various
evaluation metrics, demonstrate that our method significantly out-
performs state-of-the-art PML methods. The code implementation
is publicly available at https://github.com/Yangfc-ML/NLR.

1 INTRODUCTION
Multi-label learning (MLL) [ 4,6,37] is a supervised learning para-
digm where each sample is associated with multiple labels. MLL has
a close connection with real-world scenarios, and thus has attracted
widespread attention and has been applied in various fields such as
image annotation [ 14,21], bioinformatics [ 3,35], and information
retrieval [ 15]. However, obtaining accurate multiple labels is usually
difficult and costly. Moreover, when annotators cannot determine
the exact content of the image, they may select all possible labels
[29] as candidates. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, the annotator
could not determine whether the dog is a husky or a malamute

and could not decide whether the object covered by the dog‚Äôs front
paw is a phone or a pad, so the annotator may select these four
labels as the possible labels of the image. This kind of scenario is
abstracted into a new paradigm called partial multi-label learning
(PML)[16, 24, 29, 30].
Formally speaking, let X=Rùëëbe theùëë-dimensional feature
space andY={1,2,...,ùëû}be the label space with ùëûlabels. Given the
partial multi-label training set D={(ùë•ùëñ,ùê∂ùëñ)|1‚â§ùëñ‚â§ùëö}, whereùëö
is the total number of partial multi-label training samples, ùë•ùëñ‚ààX
is aùëë-dimensional feature vector to represent the ùëñ-th sample and
ùê∂ùëñ‚äÜY is the associated candidate label set. For example, husky,
malamute, phone, padform the candidate label set of Fig. 1. Note,
candidate label set includes ground-truth labels malamute, phone
and noisy labels husky, pad, and ground-truth labels can not be
accessed directly. PML aims to induce a multi-label classifier ùëì:
X‚Üí 2YfromD.
One simple way to deal with PML is to treat all the labels in the
candidate label set as the ground-true labels, and then use off-the-
shelf MLL methods to achieve multi-label classification. However,
due to the presence of noisy labels in the candidate label set, this
naive manner is difficult to achieve superior performance [ 29,32].
Afterwards, some two-stage PML methods [ 27,33] were proposed,
which first performed label disambiguation to estimate the con-
fidence of the candidate labels and then used the disambiguated
labels as the ground-true labels and performed MLL methods to
fulfill multi-label classification. These methods may suffer from
poor classification performance as they are limited by the quality
of the disambiguated labels obtained in the first stage. Recently,
some methods combined label disambiguation and MLL into a sin-
gle model [ 17,25,26,28,30,32] by exploring the label corrections
to recover the ground-true labels. Among them, [ 25,26,30] pro-
posed to eliminate the noisy labels from the candidate label set
based on the sparsity assumption. However, these methods are all
empirically designed without considering the influence of noisy
labels from a theoretical perspective. Moreover, they fail to fully
exploit the prior knowledge of noisy labels. On the one hand, in
PML, the noisy labels can only exist in the candidate label set, while
the noisy labels estimated by the previous methods may appear in
the non-candidate label set. On the other hand, the noise indicator
should be binary values, while those estimated by the previous
methods are all continuous variables. For example, the model will
be very confused by a noise indicator with a value of 0.5, because
it cannot determine whether it is a noisy label or not.
To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel PML method
named NLR (Noisy Label Removal for Partial Multi-Label Learn-
ing). We first establish the generalization error bound for typical
PML models based on the Rademacher complexity, theoretically re-
vealing that more noisy labels will increase the generalization error
bound and consequently degrade the classification performance.
This observation theoretically indicates that correctly noisy label
removal is the key to PML. To remove the noisy labels, we exploit
the prior knowledge of the noisy labels in PML, i.e., they only exist
in the candidate label set and the value of noisy labels should be 0
or 1, and we transform those priors as strict constraints. Moreover,
we leverage the information from both the candidate label set andthe non-candidate label set to construct a PML classifier and a com-
petitive classifier, respectively. The PML classifier indicates which
classes the sample should belong to, while the competitive classifier
indicates which classes the sample should notbelong to. By explor-
ing the competitive relationship between the two classifiers, i.e., a
larger (resp. smaller) value predicted by the PML classifier implies
a smaller (resp. larger) value predicted by the competitive classifier,
the noisy labels are easier to be removed correctly. The proposed
model is finally formulated as a discrete regression problem with
competitive learning and solved by an alternative and iterative al-
gorithm. Extensive experiments on 6 real-world partial multi-label
data sets and 7 synthetic data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed PML method.
2 RELATED WORK
PML is an emerging and important weakly supervised learning
framework that has received wide attention in recent years. PML
originates from the widely studied MLL paradigm and partial label
learning (PLL) [ 11‚Äì13] paradigm. In this section, we will briefly
introduce the existing MLL methods and PML methods.
MLL deals with the problem where each sample is associated with
multiple labels, and the key to solving MLL is to find the correlations
between labels, also called label correlations. According to different
types of label correlations, the current MLL methods can be roughly
divided into three categories: first-order label correlations, second-
order label correlations, and high-order label correlations. First-
order label correlations methods handled each class independently
[2,36], second-order label correlations methods considered the
pairwise correlations between classes [ 8,9,34], and high-order
label correlations methods considered the mutual influence of all
classes [ 5,10,22,23]. However, since there are noisy labels in the
candidate label set, and the ground-true labels cannot be directly
accessed, the existing MLL methods are often difficult to directly
apply to PML.
An intuitive way to solve PML is label disambiguation, i.e., iden-
tifying the ground-truth labels of samples from their candidate
label set. For example, [ 25,26,30] used the low-rank assumption
of the ground-true labels and the sparse assumption of the noisy
labels, hoping to build a model that can simultaneously identify
the noisy label in the candidate label set and consider the label
correlations of ground-truth labels. [ 28,31] achieved label disam-
biguation by leveraging the similarity relationship of samples in
the feature space and label correlations simultaneously, i.e., if two
samples are similar in the feature space, they are likely to share
the same ground-truth labels and if two classes have strong label
correlations, when one class appears, the other class also has a high
probability of appearing. The above methods usually perform label
disambiguation and model training iteratively and alternatively,
they were called end-to-end PML methods. Some works [ 27,33] di-
vided PML into two stages, the first stage was label disambiguation,
usually achieved by label propagation, and the second stage used
the disambiguated labels as the ground-truth labels of samples to
build a multi-label classifier. For example, [33] achieved the multi-
label classification task by using maximum a posteriori reasoning
or virtual label splitting methods after obtaining the disambiguated
labels. [ 27] achieved the classification task by using a gradient

boosting-based model. The above end-to-end and two-stage PML
methods often lack strict constraints on the noisy labels and ignore
valuable information in the non-candidate label set, which limit
their performance.
3 PROPOSED APPROACH
3.1 Generalization Error Bound
In this section, we first analyze the importance of removing noisy
labels from the perspective of the generalization error bound [20].

ùëöandùëërepresent the number of samples and the dimension of
features, respectively. Let Y=[ùë¶1,ùë¶2,¬∑¬∑¬∑,ùë¶ùëö]T‚àà{0,1}ùëö√óùëûbe

ùë¶ùëñùëó=1, if theùëó-th label is one of the candidate labels of the sample

whereLG(‚Ñé)andLS(‚Ñé)are generalization error and empirical

rem 1 are given in the Section A of the supplementary file.
Based on Theorem 1 , the generalization error bound of a linear
PML model depends on the sparsity of the noisy matrix Ethat is
controlled by ùúè. When there are too many noisy labels, i.e., ‚à•E‚à•1is
large, the generalization error bound will be enlarged, consequently
leading to the decline of the classification performance. Suppose
the estimated noisy matrix is N‚ààRùëö√óùëû,E=Y‚àíN‚àíYGcan be
regarded as the remaining noisy labels. When the estimated label
matrix Nis more accurate,‚à•Y‚àíN‚àíYG‚à•1will be smaller, which
means the upper bound of ‚à•E‚à•1is smaller, leading to better general-
ization performance. Therefore, the key to solving PML is accurate
noisy label removal.
3.2 Modeling the Noisy Label in PML
According to Theorem 1, the quality of the estimated noisy label
matrix Nsignificantly affects the performance of the model. In
order to remove noisy labels, we exploit the prior knowledge of
the noisy labels in PML and construct the following constrainedregression model:
min
W,N‚à•(Y‚àíN)‚àí XW‚à•2
ùêπ+ùõæ‚à•W‚à•2
ùêπ+ùúÜ‚à•N‚à•0 (3)
s.t.N‚àà{0,1}ùëö√óùëû,‚àÄùëñ,ùëó,Nùëñùëó=0,ifùë¶ùëñùëó=0,
where the first term aims to map the feature matrix to the label
matrix through the coefficient matrix W‚ààRùëë√óùëû, and identify the
noisy labels N‚ààRùëö√óùëûin the candidate label set. To prevent over-
fitting, the second term is introduced as the regularization term,
which is the square Frobenius norm on Wandùõæ>0is the trade-off
parameter. The third term is the sparse regularization on the label
noisy matrix N, where||¬∑|| 0denotes the ùëô0norm, i.e., the number
of non-zero elements in the matrix. We assume the noisy labels
should be sparse, and accordingly only the correct noisy labels with
high confidence will be selected during the training. ùúÜ>0is the
parameter of the sparse regularization term. The first constraint
N‚àà{0,1}ùëö√óùëûstrictly limits the elements of the noisy label matrix
to 0 or 1. Note Nùëñùëó=1represents the ùëó-th label of sample ùë•ùëñis a
noisy label, Nùëñùëó=0represents it is not a noisy label. The second
constraint‚àÄùëñ,ùëó,Nùëñùëó=0,ifùë¶ùëñùëó=0indicates noisy label Nùëñùëóonly
appears when ùë¶ùëñùëóis one of the candidate labels, and will not appear
in the non-candidate label set. Note (Y‚àíN)indicates the recovered
ground-truth label matrix. By minimizing Eq. (3), we can obtain
the PML classifier coefficient matrix Wand noisy label matrix N.
Since theùëô0norm is non-convex and difficult to optimize directly,
we relax it by its convex surrogate ùëô1norm, and then Eq. (3) becomes

s.t.N‚àà{0,1}ùëö√óùëû,‚àÄùëñ,ùëó,Nùëñùëó=0,ifùë¶ùëñùëó=0,
where||¬∑||1is theùëô1norm of a matrix, i.e., the sum of absolute values
of all elements in a matrix. Note that as we require the noisy label
matrix Nonly possesses the binary values, the optimal solutions of
Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) are the same.
3.3 Competitive Classifier Promoted Noisy
Label Removal
Sine the candidate label matrix involves the noisy labels, while the
non-candidate labels of a sample precisely indicate the classes to
which the sample does not belong, we can further improve the
classification performance by the information of non-candidate
label set. Suppose ÀÜY=[ÀÜùë¶1,ÀÜùë¶2,¬∑¬∑¬∑,ÀÜùë¶ùëö]T‚àà{0,1}ùëö√óùëûbe the non-
candidate label matrix and ÀÜùë¶ùëñ=[ÀÜùë¶ùëñ1,ÀÜùë¶ùëñ2,¬∑¬∑¬∑,ÀÜùë¶ùëñùëû]T‚ààRùëû. Different
from the candidate label matrix, ÀÜùë¶ùëñùëó=1indicatesùëó-th label is not
the ground-truth label of sample ùë•ùëñ. Therefore, we can construct a
competitive classifiers that reflect which classes the samples should
not be assigned to, i.e.,
min
ÀÜW,N(ÀÜY+N)‚àí XÀÜW2
ùêπ+ùõæÀÜW2
ùêπ+ùúÜ‚à•N‚à•1
s.t.N‚àà{0,1}ùëö√óùëû,‚àÄùëñ,ùëó,Nùëñùëó=0,ifùë¶ùëñùëó=0.(5)
Similar to Eq. (4), ÀÜW‚ààRùëë√óùëûis the competitive classifier coefficient
matrix and we also used square Frobenius norm on ÀÜWto control
its complexity. Note that the initial non-candidate label matrix ÀÜYis
incomplete, as there are some negative labels in the candidate label
set. Accordingly, we can use the noisy label matrix Nto complete the
non-candidate label matrix, i.e., (ÀÜY+N). By optimizing Eq. (5), the
noisy label removal will be promoted by the competitive classifier.

Moreover, the PML classifier in Eq. (4) predicts which labels
should be assigned to a sample, while the competitive classifier
in Eq. (5) predicts which labels should not be assigned to that
sample. These two classifiers form a competitive relationship, i.e., a
larger (resp. smaller) value predicted by the PML classifier implies
a smaller (resp. larger) value predicted by the competitive classifier,
and vice versa. In the ideal case, the above competitive relationship
can be formulated as 1ùëö√óùëû=XW+XÀÜW, where 1ùëö√óùëûis an all ones
matrix. By incorporating the competitive relationship into Eq. (5),
we have

(6)
whereùõΩis a parameter to introduce the competitive relationship.
3.4 Overall Formulation
By combining the PML classifier in Eq. (4) and the competitive
classifier in Eq. (6), we can obtain the final model, i.e.,

The existence of noisy labels in the candidate label set makes
PML a challenging problem. However, since the information in the
non-candidate label matrix accurately indicates whether a sample
does not belong to certain classes, it can be regarded as a kind of
accurate supervision information. Moreover, by exploiting the prior
knowledge of the noisy labels and simultaneously identifying noisy
labels through the PML classifier and the competitive classifier, and
the competitive relationship formed by two classifiers, the noisy
labels can be effectively removed, and the ground-true label matrix
can be recovered. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the
first to consider the relationship of the candidate label matrix and
the non-candidate label matrix to guide noisy label removal in PML.
4 NUMERICAL SOLUTION
Our method has three variables: the coefficient matrix W, the com-
petitive coefficient matrix ÀÜW, and the noisy label matrix N. We can
optimize Eq. (7) by solving the following subproblems alternatively
and iteratively.
4.1 Wsubproblem
By fixing other variables, the Wsubproblem is expressed as

Eq. (8) reaches the minimum when its first-order derivative with
respect to Wvanishes, leading to

4.3 Nsubproblem
TheNsubproblem can be formulated as

ùêπandùëî(N)=
ùúÜ‚à•N‚à•1. Bothùëì(N)andùëî(N)are convex. Furthermore, ùëì(N)is
Lipschitz continuous gradient [ 1], i.e.,‚à•‚àáùëì(N1)‚àí‚àáùëì(N2)‚à•ùêπ‚â§
ùêøùëì‚à•ŒîN‚à•ùêπ, where ŒîN=N1‚àíN2andùêøùëìis the Lipschitz constant.
Therefore, we can use the iterative shrinkage thresholding algo-
rithm (ISTA) [ 1] to solve it. Specifically, ‚àáùëì(N)is the gradient of
ùëì(N)and can be calculate as
‚àáùëì(N)=4N‚àí2Y+2ÀÜY+2XW‚àí2XÀÜW. (13)
According to Eq. (13), given N1andN2, we have

Therefore, we set the Lipschitz constant ùêøùëìto 4, i.e.,ùêøùëì=4. Ac-
cording to Eqs. (12), (13) and (14), Nsubproblem can be optimized

4.4 Complexity Analysis
The computational complexity of Algorithm 1 is mainly determined
by steps 3-5. Specifically, steps 3 and 4 involve the matrices mul-
tiplication with the complexity of ùëÇ(ùëöùëëùëû). Step 5 solves an ISTA
algorithm, leading to the complexity of ùëÇ(ùëöùëëùëû). Therefore, the
overall computational complexity of Algorithm 1 in each iteration
isùëÇ(3ùëöùëëùëû). More analysis about computational complexity can be
found in Section B of the supplementary file.

data sets are constructed from the widely used multi-label data
sets. Following [ 17,18], we randomly selected ùëülabels from the
negative labels as the noisy labels for each sample. Therefore, the
candidate label set of synthetic data sets consist of all ground-truth
labels andùëünoisy labels. For data sets with less than 10 classes, we
choseùëü‚àà{1,2,3}, for data sets with more than 10 classes and less
than 100 classes, we chose ùëü‚àà{3,7,11}, and for data sets with more
than 100 classes, we chose ùëü‚àà{10,20,30}. Table 1 shows the detailed
information of the data sets, where AVG. CLs represents the average
number of candidate labels per sample and AVG. GLs represents the
average number of ground-truth labels per sample. Note that, in the
experiments, we found that many samples in the real-world partial
multi label data sets YeastMF, YeastCC, and YeastBP do not have
ground-truth labels and only contain a few noisy labels. Therefore,
in the experiments, we removed the samples without ground-truth
labels and randomly added noisy labels to the remaining samples.Specifically, we added 3, 5, and 10 noisy labels to each sample in
data sets YeastMF, YeastCC, and YeastBP, respectively.
5.1.2 Comparing methods. We compared our method with 9 state-
of-the-art PML methods and each method was configured with the
suggested parameters in the literature, i.e., FPML (ICDM 2018) [ 32],
PML-LRS (AAAI 2019) [ 26], PML-NI (TPAMI 2022) [ 30], PARTICLE-
MAP and PARTICLE-VLS (P-MAP and P-VLS for short (TPAMI
2021) [ 33]), PAKS (TCyber 2023) [ 17], GLC (TMM 2022) [ 25] and
PARD (NeurIPS 2023) [ 7]. In addition, we used five widely used
multi-label metrics [ 6,37] to evaluate the performance of each
comparing method, i.e., hamming loss, rank loss, one-error, coverage
andaverage precision. Five-fold cross-validation was performed on
each data set and the mean metric value and the standard deviation
were recorded. Due to the page limit, the experiment results on
hamming loss and coverage are shown in the Section C of the
supplementary file.
5.1.3 Parameter settings. Our method contains three parameters,
parameterùõæcontrols the model complexity, parameter ùõΩcontrols
the competitive relationship, and parameter ùúÜcontrols the sparse
regularization term. In the experiments, parameters ùõæandùõΩwere
selected from{0.001,0.01,...,1000}, andùúÜwas tuned from[1,4]
with step size 0.1 each time. The total number of iterations was set
to 100.
5.2 Experimental Results
5.2.1 Classification performance. Tables 2, 3 and 4 report the exper-
imental results on metrics: rank loss, one-error andaverage precision .
Tables S3 and S4 in the Section C of supplementary file show the
experimental results on hamming loss andcoverage. According to
these tables, our method NLR achieved the best performance in
84.3% (118/140) of all five evaluation metrics. Taking rank loss as
an example, on the real-world data sets YeastMF and YeastCC, NLR
improves the rank loss of the best comparison from 0.229 to 0.200
and from 0.167 to 0.144, respectively. Taking average precision as an
example, on the data sets Scene ( ùëü= 3) and Medical ( ùëü= 11), NLR
increases the average precision of the best comparison from 0.735 to
0.822 and from 0.776 to 0.842, respectively. As the number of noisy
labelsùëüincreases, it becomes more difficult to find the ground-truth
labels. Accordingly, the average precision of all the PML methods
decreases, but our method NLR still maintains a high average pre-
cision, which demonstrates that our method is effective in more
challenging PML tasks. Furthermore, different methods have differ-
ent characteristics and are suited to different data sets. For example,
PML-NI performs well on data set Medical, but poorly on others;
PAKS is good at data sets Enron and Philosophy, but badly at Scene
and Birds. However, our method performs excellently on almost all
data sets, proving its robustness.
5.2.2 Significance test. Table 5 reports win/tie/loss counts of our
method NLR against each comparing method on the five multi-label
metrics. The results are based on the pairwise t-test at 0.05signif-
icance level. As shown in the table, we can find that our method
significantly outperforms other methods in five evaluation metrics
hamming loss, rank loss, one-error, coverage, and average precision
by 75.0%, 83.8%, 83.8%, 77.3%, and 88.0%, respectively. Moreover,
our method achieves superior performance than deep learning PML

tion metrics, our method significantly outperforms other comparing

robustness in PML tasks.
5.2.3 Noisy label identification. Fig. 2 compares the noisy label
identification ability of our method with three existing PML meth-
ods: PML-LRS, PML-NI, and GLC. The experiments were conducted
on data sets Scene ( ùëü= 3) and Birds ( ùëü= 11). The blue bars denote the
total number of noisy labels of each class in the data set, while the
orange bars indicate the number of noisy labels that are correctly
identified by each method for each class. The green bars represent
the number of labels that are false identified as noisy labels for
each class, i.e., treating the ground-true labels or the non-candidate
labels as the noisy labels. Additionally, each subfigure also displaystheprecision, recall andF1 Score for noisy label identification. Ac-
cording to Fig. 2 (a) - (h), PML-LRS and GLC have poor performance
when identifying noisy labels on both data sets. They only correctly
identify a small fraction of the noisy labels. Consequently, their
F1 Scores are very low, ranging from 14.4% to 38.7%. PML-NI iden-
tify more noisy labels than PML-LRS and GLC, as indicated by the
higher height of the orange bars. However, PML-NI suffers from a
high rate of false identification, as indicated by the high height of
thegreen bars. In contrast, our method outperforms other methods
by a large margin on both data sets. It identifies the majority of
the noisy labels correctly, as indicated by the highest height of the
orange bars and it also ensures a lower false identification rate.
Specifically, our method achieves the highest F1 Score 82.3% on data
sets Scene and 88.6% on data set Birds respectively. These results
demonstrate that our method is very effective and robust in noisy
label identification for PML.

5.3 Further Analysis
5.3.1 Ablation study. In table 6, we conduct ablation studies to
demonstrate the necessity of each component in our method. NLR-
ùë£1, NLR-ùë£2, and NLR- ùë£3represent our method without the com-
petitive classifier, without the ùëô1norm of the noisy label matrix,and without the constraint on the noisy label matrix, respectively.
From table 6, we can find that compared with NLR- ùë£1, considering
the non-candidate label set information improves the model perfor-
mance on rank loss (the smaller the better ‚Üì) by 2.5% and on average
precision (the larger the better ‚Üë) by 3.7%. Compared with NLR- ùë£2,

removing the ùëô1norm leads to substantial performance degradation,
which proves that the ùëô1norm effectively captures the label noise
pattern. Compared with NLR- ùë£3, imposing the constraint on the
noisy label matrix improves the rank loss by 1.6% and increases the
average precision by 4.7% on average. The ablation study validates
the effectiveness of each component in our method and taking all
components into account is the best choice.
5.3.2 Parameters sensitivity. Fig. 3 (a)-(c) reports the parameters
sensitivity of our method. All experiments were conducted on data
sets Music_style, Birds ( ùëü=3), and Medical ( ùëü=3), and the ex-
periment results of average precision were recorded. Fig. 3 (a)-(b)
report the performance changes of our method when adjusting
parametersùõΩandùõæ, which control the competitive learning and the
complexity of two coefficient matrices, respectively. We find that
there is an optimal range for both parameters, and too large or too
small values will lead to relatively poor performance. In Fig. 3 (c),
we show the performance changes when adjusting the parameter
ùúÜ, which controls the sparse regularization term, i.e., the number of
noisy labels identified by the model. We vary ùúÜin the range of [1,4]
with a step size of 0.1. We can observe that the model is relativesensitive to ùúÜ, as it has an important impact on the model‚Äôs ability
to identify the noisy labels. Therefore, parameter ùúÜneeds to be
carefully tuned.
5.3.3 Convergence analysis and comparison of running time. Fig. 3
(d) reports the convergence curves of our model, where the vertical
axis represents the change of the PML classifier between the current
iteration and the previous iteration, i.e.,Wùë°+1‚àíWùë°ùêπ, whereùë°+1
represents the current iteration. It can be seen that our method
empirically converges well on all data sets. Fig. 4 reports the running
time of all PML methods. The running time is shown in a log10
scale, i.e., log10(time+1). From Fig. 4, we find that our method
ranks fourth on average in running time, demonstrating that our
method not only achieves superior classification performance but
is also competitive with existing methods in running time.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a novel noisy label removal method named
NLR for PML. Specifically, we theoretically prove the importance
of removing noisy labels from the perspective of the generalization
error bound. To identify noisy labels, we design a model consists
of a PML classifier that predicts which classes the sample should
belong to and a competitive classifier that predicts which classes
the sample should not belong to. These two classifiers form an
competitive relationship to learn from each other and jointly select
the noisy labels. Moreover, we make full use of prior knowledge
of noisy labels in PML by setting strict constraints on our model.
Extensive experiments and comparisons on 6 real-world partial
multi-label data sets and 7 synthetic data sets have shown that our
method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art
PML methods in terms of noisy label identification and achieves
superior performance on five widely used multi-label metrics.

We further assume that ùëö>ùëë>ùëû,ùëárepresents the number of
iterations.
According to the time complexity based on linear regression
methods shown in Table S1, our method NLR has a slightly higher

C EXPERIMENT DETAILS
Our method has two classifiers, the original classifier Wand the
competitive classifier ÀÜW, where Wpredicts which classes belong
to the sample, and ÀÜWpredicts which classes do not belong to the
sample. Therefore, we constructed the following three prediction
methodsùëÄ1,ùëÄ2andùëÄ3
Ô£±Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥ Ô£≤
Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£≥ùëÄ1:ùë¶ùëñ=ùë•ùëñW,
ùëÄ2:ùë¶ùëñ=1ùëû‚àíùë•ùëñÀÜW,
ùëÄ3:ùë¶ùëñ=ùë•ùëñW‚àíùë•ùëñÀÜW,(S7)
whereùë•ùëñdenotes a testing sample, 1ùëû‚ààR1√óùëûis an all ones vector.
ùëÄ1represents directly using the PML classifier to predict which
classes belong to the sample; ùëÄ2represents using the competitive
classifier to predict which classes do not belong to the sample, and
then obtaining which classes belong to the sample by 1ùëû‚àíùë•ùëñÀÜW;
ùëÄ3represents the two classifiers cooperating to determine which
classes the sample belongs to. We report the rank loss of these three
prediction methods in Table S2. The experimental results show
that, in most cases, the results of the three prediction methods
are the same, proving that the PML classifier and the competitive
classifier have formed a good cooperative relationship and have
strong robustness. Therefore, in this paper, we use ùëÄ1to predict
the testing samples.
Table S3 and S4 report experimental results on hamming loss
andcoverage. Note when predicting the hamming loss, a threshold
is needed to separate ground-truth labels and negative labels, so
we set the threshold of all methods on all data sets to 0.9 for fair
comparisons.
