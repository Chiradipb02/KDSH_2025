Abstract
Financial market predictions utilize historical data to anticipate fu-
ture stock prices and market trends. Traditionally, these predictions
have focused on the statistical analysis of quantitative factors, such
as stock prices, trading volumes, inflation rates, and changes in in-
dustrial production. Recent advancements in large language models
motivate the integrated financial analysis of both sentiment data,
particularly market news, and numerical factors. Nonetheless, this
methodology frequently encounters constraints due to the paucity
of extensive datasets that amalgamate both quantitative and quali-
tative sentiment analyses. To address this challenge, we introduce
a large-scale financial dataset, namely, Financial News and Stock
Price Integration Dataset (FNSPID). It comprises 29.7 million stock
prices and 15.7 million time-aligned financial news records for 4,775
S&P500 companies, covering the period from 1999 to 2023, sourced
from 4 stock market news websites. We demonstrate that FNSPID
excels existing stock market datasets in scale and diversity while
uniquely incorporating sentiment information. Through financial
analysis experiments on FNSPID, we propose: (1) the dataset’s
size and quality significantly boost market prediction accuracy; (2)
adding sentiment scores modestly enhances performance on the
transformer-based model; (3) a reproducible procedure that can
update the dataset. Completed work, code, documentation, and
examples are available at github.com/Zdong104/FNSPID. FNSPID
offers unprecedented opportunities for the financial research com-
munity to advance predictive modeling and analysis.

For decades, time series regression models have been a cornerstone
in developing financial valuation methods. This approach is pivotal
not only in traditional finance models but also in artificial intelli-
gence for financial forecasting, a field marked by the complexity
and unpredictability of market patterns.
Traditional financial market analysis adopts the Fama-French
Three-Factor Model (FFM) [ 10], and the Chen, Roll, and Ross Ar-
bitrage Pricing Theory (APT) [ 6] which are both pivotal in asset
pricing. These models use linear regression to analyze returns but
do not focus on specific market highs and lows. Both models’ re-
liance on historical data limits their effectiveness in anticipating
future market shifts or unprecedented events like financial crises.
Emerging machine learning (ML) techniques have shown promise
in addressing these limitations. Previous studies demonstrate ML’s
effectiveness over traditional models [ 18,38]. Moreover, Billah and
Bhuiyan highlighted the superiority of integrating stock price and
news sentiments in deep learning (DL) techniques in stock market
prediction [ 4]. These emerging methods, utilizing models like Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) [ 28],
and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, have demonstrated sub-
stantial improvement in timing market movements, a crucial aspect
where traditional models fell short. [19, 29, 47, 48].
"Modern portfolio theory", by Harry Markowitz, emphasizes the
market correlation [ 9,17]. Recent studies have highlighted a strong
positive correlation of sentiment information, including news, blogs,
and social media, with the stock market trends [ 8,14]. The advent of
advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4
developed by OpenAI [ 31] have significantly improved the accuracy
of sentiment analysis in this context. The research from Lopez-Lira
mentioned LLMs, like GPT-3, struggled with accurate market return
forecasting. However, cutting-edge models, like GPT-4, achieved
the highest Sharpe ratios, demonstrating increased reliability [ 24].
Beyond sentiment analysis by GPT-4, LLMs serve diverse roles
in finance, including RL and specialized financial LLMs like Fin-
GPT [ 45] and FinRL [ 23]. Integrating numerical data into language
models is challenging, but multi-modal models embedded stock
prices and news data enhance accuracy [ 13,30]. However, this ap-
proach may not optimize general pre-trained LLMs due to potential
information loss from using only sentiment scores. Meanwhile, the
lack of comprehensive and integrated datasets has significantly
limited advancing research, particularly in implementing more so-
phisticated models like those based on transformer technology,
which could significantly enhance financial analysis. To address
this gap, previous datasets, such as Philips’s news from Bloomberg
and Reuters [ 32], and Yutkin’s news from Lenta [ 49], along with
contributions from sources like Benzinga, have been valuable. How-
ever, these datasets often lack sufficient data volume for training
large models and do not always include corresponding stock prices.

Table 1: Comparison of existing datasets for Time Series Financial Analysis. FNSPID stands out with the highest volume of news data and
includes unique features not found in other benchmark datasets. In the label, SemEval* stands for SemEval-2017 Task5 dataset.
Moreover, the available news data frequently lacks a structured
time series format, posing challenges for sequence-to-sequence
prediction models. To solve these issues, we introduce the Financial
News and Stock Price Integration Dataset (FNSPID). This dataset
uniquely combines time series news and stock prices, providing a
groundbreaking resource for financial market analysis.
1. Utilization of ML for Finance: FNSPID is designed for stock
market prediction ML model development. Its textual and numerical
data integration enhances model functionality and provides a solid
foundation. The dataset is not limited to ML but also other financial
sentiment-price correlation analyses and offers nuanced insights
into market dynamics and stock price trends.
2. Insight from FNSPID: Experiments utilizing FNSPID demon-
strated larger datasets lead to better performance in price prediction;
quality of sentiments leads to a positive effect on boosting accuracy.
3. Apply and reproduce FNSPID: FNSPID founded research
in the financial domain for sentiment analysis, LLM fine-tuning,
and research on DL models. We provided reproducible examples
with instructions for expanding the datasets.
In Section 2 of this paper, we describe the related work for fi-
nancial datasets. In Section 4, we show that FNSPID is a significant
advancement in financial forecasting, filling key gaps in existing re-
sources. In Section 5, we present that FNSPID enables the training
of larger stock prediction models more accurately in market dynam-
ics analysis with the advantage of a large amount of time series
news with stock price data. The dataset’s various features, includ-
ing data attributes, enabled diverse applications beyond machine
learning, encompassing sentiment analysis, trend evaluation, and
risk assessment. Section 3 describes how FNSPID is constructed;
Section 6 discusses FNSPID application and ethics. Our objective is
to demonstrate that (a) FNSPID supports research in advanced ML
techniques. (b) Beyond academia, FNSPID supports precise financial
tools and aids in better capital allocation.

2.1 Evolution of Financial Analysis Models
Financial analysis has undergone significant evolution, especially
with the advent of sophisticated models. Key examples among
these are the Fama-French Three-Factor Model (FFE) [ 10], and the
Chen, Roll, and Ross Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) model [ 6]. As
shown in Appendix Section A.1, these models consider factors such
as market risk, size, and value to understand asset prices. While
they contribute to long-term analysis, they lack the granularity toforecast short-term price movements effectively, such as the exact
peaks or troughs in stock prices. This limitation has prompted the
exploration of additional data sources to enhance the predictive
accuracy in financial analysis.
To enhance accuracy in time series financial analysis, common
tools like Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) [ 27]
and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity
(GARCH) [ 20] are widely implemented. These tools, along with
traditional metrics and technical analyses, support market trend
analysis but have limitations due to the subjectivity and bias in
investors’ decision-making.
However, the emergence of machine learning (ML) has greatly
improved accuracy in timing market entries and exits. The use of ML
in financial markets has evolved from basic techniques like Linear
Regression and SVM to advanced methods such as LSTM, RNN, and
Deep Q-learning [ 19,29,47]. Direct application of reinforcement
learning in stock trading strategies shows promise [ 48], and DL
models prove effective in stock market analysis.
Recent studies highlighted ML, utilizing diverse data sources
like real-time news, social media sentiment, and economic indi-
cators, becomes a robust alternative to traditional stock predic-
tion methods. Sheth and Kurani confirm this by comparing ML
approaches to traditional models, emphasizing ML’s ability to de-
tect complex, non-linear patterns and adapt to changing market
conditions [ 18,38]. LSTM models have also shown impressive er-
ror reduction (MAE), underscoring ML’s continuous learning and
updating capabilities [ 4], making it a reliable tool in financial fore-
casting, which nicely moves beyond historical trends to incorporate
and adapt to current market dynamics.
Financial news significantly influences the overall movement
of the market, particularly evident by a GARCH model analysis
during the 2008-2009 financial crisis by recent research [ 35]. In
terms of sentiment analysis, numerous studies have highlighted
the conditional efficacy of combining sentiment analysis with ma-
chine learning techniques to enhance prediction accuracy in vari-
ous domains, including financial markets [ 21,22,24,39,40,42,44].
Specifically, Venuti [ 42] employed a graph-based machine learning
framework to analyze company relationships, although it did not in-
corporate real-time market data. Similarly, Wang et al. [ 44] focused
on integrating sentiment analysis with machine learning for stock
volatility prediction, but without engaging deeply with specific
financial metrics. The impact of news sentiment on financial mar-
kets, as studied by Qudah and Rabhi, involved analyzing sentiment
datasets but did not consider individual investor behaviors [33].
4919FNSPID: A Comprehensive Financial News Dataset in Time Series KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain.
Remarkably, recent studies using pre-trained language models
like GPT-3.5 for generating news articles and then applying sen-
timent analysis to predict stock prices have shown promising re-
sults, outperforming traditional sentiment analyzing algorithms
and methods [ 24,45]. These advancements include FinGPT, a model
trained on a large corpus of financial news for generating high-
quality articles. Furthermore, Gupta (2020) delved into the correla-
tion between sentiment data and stock prices, enhancing predictive
models [ 13]. Recent research conducted by Zhou [ 51] explores the
capabilities of LLMs backbone models for time series prediction.
This study demonstrates considerable prediction accuracy in utiliz-
ing these models, despite their frequent oversight for non-financial
market applications and the challenges posed by the scarcity of
robust datasets.
2.2 Existing Stock Dataset
Many previous works have demonstrated that sentiment analysis’s
accuracy for various DL models is highly dependent on the amount
of training data and the quality of the training data. [ 1,3,15,25,34].
The financial dataset landscape is evolving, with a growing empha-
sis on integrating sentiment analysis and news content for more
accurate stock market predictions. Lutz [ 26] offers a dataset that
provides binary sentence-level sentiment analysis, categorizing
financial news as positive or negative, along with textual represen-
tations. However, this dataset does not include detailed company
financials, presenting a unique perspective on financial news senti-
ment.In contrast, Farimani [ 11] introduced a dataset that combines
latent economic concepts, news sentiment, and technical indicators,
where all the data is provided in time series which is very important
for combining the sentiment information with stock price infor-
mation, but the sentiment information included is the currency
exchange rate and correlated news. Meanwhile, it falls short in
terms of in-depth trading data. Cortis [ 7] provided a dataset for
fine-grained sentiment analysis of financial microblogs and news,
including sentiment scores and lexical/semantic features. However,
this dataset contains only a limited amount of news headlines (1142
articles) and employs a proprietary formula for sentiment scoring,
which may not accurately reflect actual news sentiment. Moreover,
Sinha et al [ 40] SEntFiN 1.0 dataset, notable for its entity-sentiment
annotations and extensive database of financial entities, provides
relatively more handy information than the work provided previ-
ously. Nevertheless, it does not include the timestamp which plays
a critical role in aligning sentiment data with price data. Mean-
while, short headlines were the only information provided, which
can be inaccurate in determining the sentiment within short para-
graphs and the small dataset does not provide enough information
to support the sentiment information training.
To address this, Philippe’s dataset, sourced from Bloomberg and
Reuters, offers a large collection of financial news time series for
analysis [ 32]. However, it lacks entities for target sentiment analysis
with raw, unprocessed news content. This could impact forecasting
accuracy. Recent innovations include a novel stock price prediction
method combining numerical data with social media text features,
using a deep reinforcement learning model, and introducing new
dynamic datasets for evaluating prediction models [ 23]. Meanwhile,
the Finnhub dataset provides stock prices with correlated news in a

time series by calling the API. It is beneficial for sentiment analysis
research, though the proprietary and the lack of sentiment analysis
makes the model training inconvenient. However, the dataset is
not tested on the quality from previous research [43].
FNSPID encompasses a wide range of financial news in English
and Russian, covering 1999 to 2023. FNSPID correlates news with
stock prices, serving as a valuable resource for sentiment analysis
and stock price prediction. Concerning data quality, especially in the
context of the proliferation of ’fake news,’ our dataset exclusively
sources information from trusted financial news platforms like
NASDAQ. This ensures the reliability and relevance of the data for
sentiment analysis and stock market prediction, setting a standard
for dataset integrity in financial modeling research.
One of the challenges in this field is the limited access to high-
quality, open-source datasets. For instance, datasets and models
like Finchat and BloombergGPT, while valuable, often come with
accessibility restrictions and are not openly available for academic
research. This limitation hampers the ability of researchers to fully
explore and develop innovative models in financial prediction. This
work seeks to address this gap by providing a dataset that is both
comprehensive and accessible, paving the way for more open and
inclusive research in the field of financial modeling.

data. In this section, we are going to describe the construction of the
main part of FNSPID which includes all the sentiment and numerical
information (Task 1). Next, we are going to describe how we build
up the summarized sentiment dataset (Task 2). Lastly, we talked
about how we built up the quantified sentiment dataset (Task 3).

news websites such as Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, Reuters, Forbes
CNBC, etc. However, all of these websites have limited policies on
data usage. We collected news from NASDAQ, which involves a
two-stage process. Initially, we collected headlines and URLs from
NASDAQ for each stock in the list by the Python package Selenium.
Then, we extracted news content from URLs to build the textual
part of the dataset. To enhance data integrity and diversity and
prevent website bias, we processed and combined previous raw
data from Bloomberg, Reuters, Benzinga, and Lenta, which offer
comprehensive or longer-retained information. Combining the two
parts, we build up the FNSPID Task 1.
Data Ethics: In collecting data from NASDAQ, we rigorously
adhered to ethical standards, consulting the robots.txt file to ensure
compliance with website policies and avoiding potential conflicts
of interest. Mindful of copyright and regional policies, we restricted
our collection to content freely available without premium access
or subscription requirements. Given the absence of an API, we
resorted to web scraping to acquire the necessary news data. By
acknowledging and confirming the license of previous work, we
combined the existing processed data as part of FNSPID.
3.1 Data mining and processing
After collecting the raw dataset containing numerical prices, URLs,
news headlines, and news text, we performed extensive sentiment
analysis by summarizing each article using four methods: LexRank,
Luhn, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and TextRank. Each method
comes from the Python package Sumy, known for its robust summa-
rization capabilities and rule-based tokenization approach. Thesesummaries are crucial for handling token limitations and practi-
cal constraints in sentiment analysis (Task 2). To enhance the
summaries’ relevance to the related stock, we introduced a weight
model𝑊𝑓detailed in Appendix A.2 to enhance the summary by
giving more attention to the related stock. After sample reviewing,
we set the summary length to 3 sentences to ensure the summaries
concisely contained useful information, which is approximately
one-eighth of the original length to keep the conciseness while
avoiding losing the specificity. This step significantly reduced to-
ken usage for subsequent large language model analyses while
reaching the critical point for ChatGPT’s prompt stability giving
out a stable answer. With this, we finished constructing the FNSPID
Task 2.
Sentiment Quantification Neither early-state LLMs, like GPT-
2 and GPT-3, nor time-series deep learning models can understand
natural language properly. The limitation of computational re-
sources does not allow most of the experiments including mod-
els like ChatGPT, which has hundreds of billions of parameters.
However, previous work shows DL models could handle the senti-
ment signals properly [ 1,3,15,25,34]. To meet the requirement,
we incorporated a small dataset of news articles collected from 50
prominent US stocks from S&P 500 with sentiment labels (Task
3). To integrate sentiment labels into the input without intensive
human labeling, we utilized ChatGPT for sentiment analysis, ac-
knowledging the challenges faced by conventional algorithms and
language models, including GPT-2 and GPT-3, in accurately scoring
sentiments [ 12,16,24,50]. We opted for the output from the pre-
vious step from the LSA summarizer algorithm, which condensed
the news content and provided ChatGPT with succinct yet compre-
hensive inputs for sentiment analysis. Figure 2 illustrates how the
summarized news content is used as a user prompt for ChatGPT.
To ensure effectiveness in maintaining the model’s stability, we
input up to 10 data entries at a time into ChatGPT with a tempera-
ture setting of 0. During the experiment, the sentiment score from
1 to 5 is more stable than other distributions like -1 to 1, and 1
to 10. Among these, using decimals to describe sentiment distri-
bution causes the most inaccurate sentiment representation. We
employed a sentiment scoring scale that spanned from 1 to 5, as
shown in Figure 2, where 1 represented a negative sentiment, 2
was somewhat negative, 3 was neutral, 4 somewhat positive, and 5
was positive. This gradation in scoring facilitated a more detailed
and subtle interpretation of news sentiment. In integrating these
sentiment scores with other features of our model, we applied a
consistent normalization approach. This was crucial to ensure that
while the sentiment scores contributed to the model’s training, they
did not disproportionately influence its outcomes. From the senti-
ment score quantified by ChatGPT, we see an approximate of the
normal distribution as shown in Figure 4.

and articles summarized through four distinct methodologies. This
diverse array of data points underscores the dataset’s depth and
breadth. The collective effort, requiring approximately 4TB of com-
puting power and 45 days, reflects our commitment to overcoming
these challenges and ensuring the robustness of our analysis.
Beyond the summarization, we expanded our analysis to include
50 stock samples selected from the top 50 influential stocks in the
S&P 500 as of 2024. These samples were incorporated into our batch
for sentiment labeling, resulting in a total of 402,546 news items
with assigned sentiment scores.

also conducted experiments to test its reliability. In this section, we
use the quantity and quality tests to examine the dataset’s over-
all performance. This section outlines our experimental strategy,
showcasing the dataset’s robustness in real-world applications.
5.1 Quantity Test
For stock price predictions, people use numerical data and senti-
ment information as inputs to predict the short-term stock market
behavior. Different models recognize different data patterns which
leads to variations in the prediction performance. We used the FN-
SPID Task 3 to conduct experimental analysis, aiming to research
the effectiveness of the quantity of news in the models. As shown
in Figure 7, we conducted a comparison of DL methods in stock
price prediction. The choice of LSTM, RNN, Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) [ 5], and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) [ 37] as our
primary models for validating the traditional method’s performance
of FNSPID. Beyond that, we also experimented with more novel
methods in financial predictions: 4-layers Vanilla Transformer [ 41]
and 4-layers TimesNet [ 46] [37] which are both proficient in time
series prediction. The normalizer models are placed in Appendix
A.3. During the qualitative experiments, input features include openprice, close price, and trading volume as baseline input features.
We used 50 days of information and predicted 3 days in the future.
Experiments were conducted for training with different numbers
of stocks: 5 stocks (n = 11277), 25 stocks (n = 43192), and 50 stocks
(n = 127937). 100 epochs was used for each training set. After the
model training we used 5 stocks for evaluation, among them, we
eliminated one outlier from the experiment result and gave the
average value as the result.
Test Results: The result of the quantitative analysis for FNSPID
is shown in Table 3, Part A-Sen. and A-Non. where the A-Sen. repre-
sent the experiment A with sentiment input, and A-Non. represent
the experiment A excluded the sentiment information. The experi-
mental result demonstrated on average 6.29 percent improvement
of𝑅2from 5 stocks of training to 25 stocks of training among all
6 models we conducted. The Transformer based model has the
highest accuracy 𝑅2=0.988,the LSTM in second place achieved an
accuracy of𝑅2=0.856, and GRU model in third place got 𝑅2=0.827.
Meanwhile, the RNN model had the worst performance 𝑅2=0.617.
Noticeably, Transformer overall has the best performance on ac-
curacy in general which achieved 𝑅2=0.988for accuracy where
the second place is LSTM( 𝑅2=0.856) which is more than 0.13
Δ𝑅2in difference with Transformer model. Through these meticu-
lous experiments, we demonstrated the practical application and
robustness of the FNSPID dataset, underscoring its value in finan-
cial modeling and sentiment analysis research. In general, in the
trend analysis, a larger training dataset can lead to better perfor-
mance of the financial stock prediction, which is a limitation of
small datasets.
5.2 Quality Test
With the sample model parameters the same as in the experiment
for quantitative experiments, we compare the different models’
training performance based on the sentiment from FNSPID Task
3 and the Experimental dataset explicated from FNSPID by using
the TextBlob labeled information. The FNSPID Dataset Task 2 is
ChatGPT labeled information. The Textblob sentiment information
represents the combination of mathematical algorithms and small
NLP models in sentiment score labeling.
From the experiment, The FNSPID Dataset Task 2 in Table 3 Part
A has a positive effect on the improvement in accuracy. Where the
Textblob sentiment in Table 3 Part B, hurts model training.
To avoid the initial randomness of the model, which has a sig-
nificant impact, we conducted 5 tests to evaluate the results and
calculate their average values for the experiment results. The exper-
iment showed Sentiment quality and data quality affect the overall
performance of the data when implementing the dataset in finan-
cial forecasting DL model training. In comparing (Transformer)
sentiment and non-sentiment, while FNSPID Task 3 has a 0.2%
improvement, the Textblob sentiment has a -1.16% impact on the
overall stock price prediction.
Sentiment effectiveness: After repetitions of experiments, in
Table 3, we find only the transformer model has a positive effect
on the improvement with including sentiment information, while
TimesNet occasionally has a positive effect. We conclude other mod-
els do not have a very nice comprehension of when we integrate
the sentiment information into the model and take the sentiment

information as the noise. It is also noticeable, that in small dataset
training (when only 5 news), the LSTM outperforms the Trans-
former in training, while as the dataset goes larger, the Transformer
has significant improvement in the accuracy of prediction.
Discussion: Models’ hyper-parameters fine tuning can change
the performance. However, to compare the models, we have to set
the model parameters as close as possible, which could potentially
hurt the performance of individual models. We use the sentiment
scoring on a scale of 5 to represent the sentiment information. The
sentiment labeling methods could lead to some of the information
from paragraphs being lost and cause the under performance of
sentiment information in stock price prediction. Previous research
has shown that financial news significantly impacts stock prices [ 2].
However, our experiment revealed only a minor improvement in
model performance, attributable to two main factors: firstly, the
models’ already high prediction accuracy makes further improve-
ments challenging; secondly, potential delays in news dissemination
may delay its impact on stock prices.
In conclusion , we summarize 3 points from the experiment
based on FNSPID: 1.Both the quality and quantity of the dataset
largely affect the stock price prediction. 2.High-quality sentiment
information has a positive effect on transformer-based training.
3.The transformer-based model surpasses traditional time series
models and novel methods like TimesNet in stock price prediction.
6 FNSPID application and ethics
This discussion delves into the intricate interplay between machine
learning methodologies and financial market analysis, as evidenced
in our dataset. We critically examine the potential applications and
ethical facets associated with our research.6.1 Challenges on FNSPID Construction
In our data mining endeavor, after extracting data from Nasdaq,
we experimented with various sentiment analysis methods. Tools
like NLTK and TextBlob, alongside compact machine learning mod-
els, showed promise in interpreting simple sentiments, as in the
phrases ’I hate you’ and ’I love you.’ However, their efficacy waned
when tasked with parsing complex paragraphs from financial news
sources. Larger models, including BERT, also fell short in yielding
accurate sentiment predictions, as corroborated by Lopezlira et al.
(2023) [ 24]. These limitations led us to exclude sentiment scores
from our final analysis. The cost and practicality constraints further
sidelined the use of advanced tools like ChatGPT. Nevertheless, we
provide code in subsequent sections for users interested in calling
APIs for sentiment analysis and tailored to their specific needs.
Our preliminary trials with ChatGPT for sentiment scoring un-
derscored challenges in achieving consistent outputs. Despite uni-
form instruction prompts, the variability in results pointed to a need
for enhanced stability and interpretative precision in ChatGPT, par-
ticularly for diverse and complex financial texts. As mentioned in
the data mining section, as the summarized sentence gets longer
and is used as the user prompt input, the stability of the ChatGPT
model still needs more development. When summarized texts con-
tain more than 3 sentences, the model becomes less stable. Beyond
that, long text input from the news given to ChatGPT will distract
the model from giving the correct sentiment score.

6.2 FNSPID Applications
This section discusses the great potential of implementing FNSPID
in financial prediction and other aspects. We hope the quality, quan-
tity, and diverse applications of FNSPID offer unparalleled opportu-
nities to researchers in financial market analysis and beyond.
Multimodal models training: Developing a dataset that merges
textual and numerical inputs is crucial for creating multi-modal
models, particularly in time series stock market prediction. Such
a dataset could improve model robustness by leveraging the syn-
ergy between different data types. In addition to that, the current
reliance on sequential data in reinforcement learning (RL) can be
augmented by integrating a correlated dataset [ 45]. This approach
could significantly strengthen RL algorithms, especially in predict-
ing stock market trends. For small and fast-deployed models that
cannot understand natural languages, the FNSPID Task 3 enables
the training.
Sentiment Data in Market Prediction: Evaluating the impact
of sentiment data on market prices can draw insights from Modern
Portfolio Theory. Parallel processing of news for multiple stocks
could refine market predictions and reinforce RL algorithms.
Correlation Analysis: The dataset is pivotal in analyzing the
correlation between sentiment information and stock prices, thereby
enriching our understanding of market dynamics. FNSPID provides
aligned sentiment-numerical data, which enables more accurate
sentiment labeling, which is very important in quantitative analysis
for investment banking. Beyond that, the FNSPID can be used for
anomaly detection by recognizing the pattern of news that hap-
pened before the greater recession and helping with financial risk
management and abnormal movement forecasting.
Financial Generative AI: Given the advantage of the quantity
in the FNSPID, this dataset can aid in refining LLMs for improved
financial advisory performance, leading to the development of ad-
vanced AI financial assistants.
6.3 Dataset Ethics
In reaffirming our commitment to ethical data collection practices,
we meticulously adhere to a broad spectrum of ethical considera-
tions that extend beyond the scope of website policies during web
scraping. Our vigilant and multifaceted approach to ethics partic-
ularly focuses on privacy concerns in financial data analysis and
the potential misuse of predictive models, ensuring our research
practices meet the highest ethical standards.
Privacy Concerns in Financial Data Analysis: Financial data
is inherently sensitive and requires robust protocols to ensure pri-
vacy and data security. Our methodology includes the implemen-
tation of advanced anonymization techniques to protect personal
identifiers, and our data handling processes comply with interna-
tional data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA, ensuring
the utmost privacy and confidentiality.
Potential Misuse of Predictive Models: Predictive models
in financial contexts offer significant insights but also carry risks
of misuse or unintended consequences. We have conducted an
extensive ethical review of our predictive algorithms, incorporating
fairness audits to prevent biases and ensure these models do not
enable discriminatory practices. Clear guidelines for model usage
have been established, preventing their application in ethically
questionable contexts.Transparency and Data Marking: Upholding our ethical com-
mitment, every data point in our dataset is transparently marked
and rigorously referenced. This practice not only bolsters our re-
search’s credibility but also promotes accountability and repro-
ducibility within the academic community.
In conclusion, through these comprehensive measures, our study
not only adheres to but also advances the discourse on ethical con-
siderations in financial data analysis. We remain steadfast in our
commitment to responsible and ethical academic inquiry, continu-
ously striving to set exemplary standards in research ethics.
7 Limitations and Future work
7.1 Limitations
Our dataset, while providing valuable insights, is not without limita-
tions. The dynamic nature of website policies introduces a potential
constraint, as future changes could impact the accessibility of our
dataset. Maintaining adherence to current policies, any alterations
in the future may necessitate adjustments to the data collection pro-
cess. Additionally, the need for ongoing model validations remains
crucial. As the field of stock market prediction evolves, continuous
testing and validation of models with new datasets are imperative
to assess adaptability and performance.
7.2 Future work
Expand FNSPID: Some of the existing stock news data are very
popular and a large amount of the dataset has been included in a
short period where the total amount of the dataset that could be
collected is limited, which causes the news sentiment only 20% of
the stock price data in timestamp value alignment. In the future we
plan to expand the news dataset by developing an automated system
that will keep the dataset up to date. Exploring FNSPID: FNSPID
is one of the most complete datasets in aligning stock price and
sentiment information. This dataset can help with the completion of
a lot of new potential tasks. One is to construct multi-modal models
based on the diverse data types within our dataset. This dataset is
not only limited to the ML domain. It also provides the potential
to analyze the influence factor of sentiment information on stock
price fluctuation. The dataset will also promote news sentiment
algorithms development. Beyond that, FNSPID can be used for stock
correlation analysis as well. We hope FNSPID will become the main
resource for a wide aspect of financial-related research.
By recognizing these limitations and proposing avenues for fu-
ture exploration, we aim to encourage ongoing research efforts that
build upon and refine the contributions of our dataset.

A.1 Asset models
The FFE model, presented in Equation 1, is building upon the Capital
Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) [ 36] which calculates the Asset Price
(𝑅𝑖𝑡−𝑅𝑓𝑡) at time𝑡by considering three main factors: the excess
return on the market portfolio index ( 𝑅𝑚𝑡−𝑅𝑓𝑡), the size premium
(small minus big) ( 𝑆𝑀𝐵𝑡), and the value premium ( 𝐻𝑀𝐿𝑡). This
model brought a new perspective in understanding asset prices by
integrating market risk, size, and value factors.
𝑅𝑖𝑡−𝑅𝑓𝑡=𝛼𝑖𝑡+𝛽1(𝑅𝑚𝑡−𝑅𝑓𝑡)+𝛽2𝑆𝑀𝐵𝑡+𝛽3𝐻𝑀𝐿𝑡+𝜖(2)
The APT model, represented in Equation 2, posits that the return
of a portfolio 𝑟𝑖𝑡can be explained by multiple risk factors. These
factors include changes in industrial production ( 𝐼𝑃𝑡), expected
inflation (𝐸𝐼𝑡), unexpected inflation ( 𝑈𝐼𝑡), the excess return of long-
term corporate bonds over government bonds ( 𝐶𝐺𝑡), and the excess
return of long-term government bonds over T-bills ( 𝐺𝐵𝑡). The APT
model provided a multi-factorial framework to asset pricing, ac-
knowledging the influence of various macroeconomic factors.

A.2 Summarize Algorithm
To make the summarization more effective and include more at-
tention toward the related stock, we introduced a weight model𝑊𝑓. In the package sumy, all the sentence summarizations are
included, which means all the terms are chosen from the original
sentence. On the other hand, exclusiveness means the sentence
will be summarized in a new sentence instead of just picking out
from the original sentence. In Equation (4), we first parse the para-
graph𝑇into individual sentences and we give a sentence weight
𝑊𝑠for weight𝑚where in our method, we assign 𝑚=1to the
sentence that contains the stock symbol. We also give the selected
summarized sentences 𝑆𝑠𝑢𝑚from Equation (5) a score for 𝑛, where
in our experiment we assigned 𝑛=1, if the sentence is in the longer
sentence𝑆𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔. Finally, by implementing Equation (6), we add up
the sentence weight 𝑊𝑠and summarized weight 𝑊𝑡to get the fi-
nal weight score 𝑊𝑡. For all other sentences, the weight will be 0.
Finally, we sort the dictionary of the sentence set by weight and
generate the final summarized sentence. With these measures, our
dataset is well-prepared for detailed analysis.

𝑆𝑛=𝑉𝑛
𝑉0−1 (7)
𝑋𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 =𝑥−𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥−𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛(8)
Equation (7) represents the calculation of the normalized change
in a value (𝑆𝑛) relative to its initial value (𝑉0)using the formula
𝑆𝑛=(𝑉𝑛/𝑉0)−1. This equation measures how much the nth value
has changed compared to the initial value, expressed as a fraction
of the initial value.
Equation (8) is used for scaling a variable (𝑋𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑)to a range
between 0 and 1. It rescales the variable x by subtracting the mini-
mum value(𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛)and dividing it by the difference between the
maximum value(𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥)and the minimum value (𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛). This nor-
malization process allows data to be represented within a consistent
range, making it easier to compare and analyze.
