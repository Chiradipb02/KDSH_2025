ABSTRACT
An intelligent assistant shall be an agent that knows you and the
world, can receive your requests or predict your needs, and pro-
vide you the right services at the right time with your permission.
As smart devices such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Ray-ban
Meta get popular, Intelligent Assistants are gradually playing an
important role in people’s lives. The Emergence of wearable de-
vices brings more opportunities and calls for the next generation
of Intelligent Assistants.
In this talk, we discuss the many challenges and opportunities
we face to grow intelligent assistants from voice-only to multi-
modal, from context-agnostic to context-aware, from listening to
the users’ requests to predicting the user’s needs, and from server-
side to on-device. We describe our LLM-based solutions toward
multi-modality, contextualization, personalization, and retrieval-
augmentation, and discuss how they are enabled on devices. We
expect these new challenges to open doors to new research areas
and start a new chapter for providing personal assistance services.
