ABSTRACT
Over the last decades, a rapidly growing volume of spatiotempo-
ral data has been collected from smartphones and GPS, terrestrial,
seaborne, airborne, and spaceborne sensors, as well as computa-
tional simulations. Meanwhile, advances in deep learning technolo-
gies, especially the recent breakthroughs of generative AI and foun-
dation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision Models (LVMs), have achieved tremendous success in natu-
ral language processing and computer vision applications. There is
growing anticipation of the same level of accomplishment of AI on
spatiotemporal data in tackling grand societal challenges, such as
national water resource management, monitoring coastal hazards,
energy and food security, as well as mitigation and adaptation to
climate change. When deep learning, especially emerging founda-
tion models, intersects spatiotemporal data in scientific domains, it
opens up new opportunities and challenges. The workshop aims
to bring together academic researchers in both AI and scientific
domains, government program managers, leaders from non-profit
organizations, as well as industry executives to brainstorm and
debate on the emerging opportunities and novel challenges of deep
learning (foundation models) for spatiotemporal data inspired by
real-world scientific applications.

The recent breakthroughs of generative AI and foundation models
such as Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous
success in vision and language domains. There is growing anticipa-
tion of the same level of accomplishments of these technologies on
spatiotemporal data in interdisciplinary scientific domains, such as
hydrology, oceanography, agriculture, energy, and climate science.
However, there are ongoing debates on this matter. For example,
will foundation models pre-trained on internet videos and text data
be naturally effective for spatiotemporal data in scientific domains?
Or are novel techniques required to train/fine-tune foundation mod-
els to capture the unique characteristics of spatiotemporal data (e.g.,
grounding foundation models with physical knowledge)? What are
the new opportunities and challenges? Does solving the problem
require convergence between AI (data science) and spatiotemporal
domains? How should academic researchers, industry practitioners,
government officers, and non-profit organization leaders collabo-
rate to realize such potential impacts? The workshop aims to bring
together academic researchers in both AI and geo-scientific do-
mains and stakeholders to brainstorm and debate on the emerging
opportunities and novel challenges of deep learning (foundation
models) for spatiotemporal data inspired by real-world scientific
applications.
This workshop will provide a premium platform for researchers
from both academia and industry to exchange ideas on emerging
research themes related to deep learning for spatiotemporal data,
particularly on Foundation Models (LLMs, LVMs) and their inter-
disciplinary scientific applications. The targeted audience of this
workshop includes academic and industrial researchers from (1) the
data mining community, particularly those who are interested in de-
veloping foundation models for spatiotemporal data, (2) the spatial
computing and GIS community who are interested in integrating
AI and spatial computational technologies to solve geo-application
problems, and (3) domain scientists and practitioners in relevant
applications, such as climate scientists, hydrologists, oceanogra-
phers, first responders to natural disaster, and leaders of non-profit
organizations related to AI for Social Good. A website1has been
set up to release related information.

This workshop is the fourth of its series. The last three DeepSpa-
tial workshops (DeepSpatial’222, DeepSpatial’213and DeepSpa-
tial’204) were held as half-day workshops. DeepSpatial’20 has three
keynote talks, 8 paper presentations (accepted from 11 submissions),
and a panel. The panel discussion featured three NSF program di-
rectors (Dr. Wei Ding, Dr. Wei-shinn Ku, and Dr. Amarda Shehu)
and Dr. Shashi Shekhar from the University of Minnesota. DeepSpa-
tial’21 featured two keynote talks by leading academic professors in
the field (Dr. Yan Liu, and Dr. Shashi Shekhar) and 6 paper presen-
tations (accepted from 9 submissions). DeepSpatial’22 hosted two
keynote talks by Dr. Stefano Ermon from Stanford University and
Dr. Chaowei Phil Yang from GMU, a panel with speakers from the
NSF, UMBC, IARPA, and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers. There
are four paper presentations. The peak attendance was around 100.
