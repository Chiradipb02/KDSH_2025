ABSTRACT
In recent years, uplift m odeling, a lso k nown a s i ndividual treat-
ment effect (ITE) estimation, has seen wide applications in online 
marketing, such as delivering one-time issuance of coupons or dis-
counts to motivate users‚Äô purchases. However, complex yet more 
realistic scenarios involving multiple interventions over time on 
users are still rarely explored. The challenges include handling the 
bias from time-varying confounders, determining optimal treat-
ment timing, and selecting among numerous treatments. In this 
paper, to tackle the aforementioned challenges, we present a tem-
poral point process-based uplift model (TPPUM) that utilizes users‚Äô 
temporal event sequences to estimate treatment effects via coun-
terfactual analysis and temporal point processes. In this model, 
marketing actions are considered as treatments, user purchases as 
outcome events, and how treatments alter the future conditional 
intensity function of generating outcome events as the uplift. Em-
pirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms ex-
isting baselines on both real-world and synthetic datasets. In the 
online experiment conducted in a discounted bundle recommenda-
tion scenario involving an average of 3 to 4 interventions per day 
and hundreds of treatment candidates, we demonstrate how our 
model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in selecting 
the appropriate treatment and timing of treatment, resulting in a 
3.6% increase in application-level revenue.

1 INTRODUCTION
In modern online marketing, uplift modeling has emerged as a
pivotal technique for enhancing user engagement and platform
revenue by offering targeted incentives (i.e., treatment) such as
coupons [31] and discounts [15]. Traditional marketing strategies
often overlook the likelihood of a customer purchasing a product
without any intervention (i.e., giving treatment). This oversight has
prompted a paradigm shift towards uplift-based strategies that pri-
oritize marketing actions to induce a significant uplift in user pur-
chases, rather than merely focusing on items with the highest prob-
ability of purchase. Consider the following scenario: during a mar-
keting campaign, the system predicts a 90% probability of a user
purchasing bottled water and a 40% probability for an energy drink.
Traditional strategies would favor bottled water due to its higher
purchase probability. However, without intervention, bottled wa-
ter might still have an 80% purchase likelihood due to its essential
nature, while the energy drink might only have a 10% likelihood. In
this case, recommending the energy drink could be more strategic,
as it represents a greater increase in purchase probability (30% vs.
10%), potentially leading to higher profits. Considering that these
incentives carry costs and that diverse users respond differently
to them ‚Äî where some only purchase with coupons, while others
would purchase regardless ‚Äî accurately identifying the sensitive

user segments for each incentive is crucial for maximizing market-
ing efficacy. Unlike traditional supervised learning, this involves
a typical causal inference problem, as we cannot observe both the
factual outcome (what actually happened) and the counterfactual
outcome (what would have happened under a different decision)
for an individual simultaneously. To achieve this objective, online
marketing employs estimation of individual treatment effects (ITE)
or uplift to accurately capture the differential response of users to
various incentives compared to no incentives. Uplift modeling has
been validated across multiple scenarios [3, 6].
Existing uplift modeling methods for online marketing can be
categorized into the meta-learner method [13, 20], the tree-based
approach [22, 26], and neural network-based approach [23, 25].
The main idea is to predict unbiased outcomes of different treat-
ments by establishing a connection between treated and controlled
groups [11], accomplished through the implementation of various
data utilization methods [20] and subpopulation segmentation [22].
While existing uplift modeling methods have demonstrated promis-
ing results in simple scenarios, such as one-time treatment, most
cannot be applied in scenarios where users receive more than one
treatment across a continuous timeline. A typical online marketing
scenario is depicted in Figure 1(a), where users have historical tem-
poral data on treatments and outcomes, posing three challenges:
‚Ä¢Highly biased data. Users‚Äô responses to past treatments
shape future treatments, resulting in a higher bias in sequen-
tial scenarios compared to static single-intervention scenar-
ios. For instance, based on learning from past data, the sys-
tem perpetually recommends high-value discounts to high-
spending users, and users develop strong expectations re-
garding discount values. The direct use of sequence learning
methods [12, 27] will be biased by the highly biased data and
will not be able to make accurate estimations of counterfac-
tuals for different treatments.
‚Ä¢Handling time-varying confounders. In Figure 1(a), the
user is given the treatment ùëì3atùë°3, assuming the user‚Äôs co-
variate itself was influenced by past treatment ùëì2, failing to
adjust for time-varying confounders (the impact of ùëì2on
user covariates) would lead to erroneous conclusions about
the effectiveness of treatment ùëì2if the user exhibits pur-
chase behavior after ùëì3rather than after ùëì2. Existing uplift-
based methods [16, 20] solely considering treatments and
outcomes dependent on static user covariate values are inad-
equate for estimating the effect of a sequence of treatments
on user outcomes.
‚Ä¢Continuous-time modeling. In online marketing, the oc-
currence of multiple events within a time window, includ-
ing treatments and outcomes, is common. A user‚Äôs outcome
event can be attributed to multiple treatments within a time
window. Time gap is a critical factor in estimating the mu-
tual influence of treatment and outcome effects, with effects
generally diminishing over time. Since uplift is defined as
the change in the distribution of future outcomes due to
treatment, the impact of treatment on future outcomes at
different time points needs to be estimated and integratedover time. Point process models [5, 7] are considered effec-
tive techniques for handling the mutual influence of events
on continuous-time event sequences.
In this paper, to tackle the aforementioned challenges, we pro-
pose a novel Temporal Point Process-based Uplift Model, denoted
as TPPUM. As shown in Figure 1(b), it models the individual treat-
ment effect of a treatment given at timestamp ùë°5on a user‚Äôs fu-
ture outcome through counterfactual reasoning on temporal point
processes. Initially, we define a causal model that characterizes
the uplift as the effect of the treatment on altering the intensity
function of user purchases. Here, the marketing action is consid-
ered the treatment, and the user‚Äôs future conditional intensity func-
tion is regarded as the outcome. To address bias stemming from
time-varying confounders in the point process, we draw inspira-
tion from CRN [4] and employ domain adversarial training to es-
tablish balancing representations of the user‚Äôs past event sequence.
Furthermore, we extend this approach from discrete time-step event
sequences to continuous time event sequences. Given an event oc-
curs at timestamp ùë°, TPPUM first constructs a time-aware treatment-
invariant representation for the user‚Äôs historical events preceding
that particular event. The resulting balancing representation, de-
noted as H, is then utilized to separately model the intensity func-
tion ùúÜ(ùë°|ùêª)and the event‚Äôs feature distribution ùëù(ùëì|ùêª)using tem-
poral point processes and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), respec-
tively. The parameters ùúÜ(ùë°|ùêª)and ùëù(ùëì|ùêª)are learned by maxi-
mizing the likelihood of each event given the user‚Äôs past event se-
quence. By directly learning the integrated intensity function, our
model allows for obtaining a closed-form solution for the expecta-
tion of the outcome distribution, thereby enhancing efficiency in
model inference.
We summarize the main contributions as follows:
‚Ä¢We first explore temporal uplift modeling for online mar-
keting, extending uplift modeling scenarios from single-step
intervention to multiple interventions across a continuous
timeline. We introduce a novel causal model that quantifies
the causal effect of treatments at specific timestamp ùë°. Addi-
tionally, we develop a neural temporal process model that
enables unbiased estimation of these effects.
‚Ä¢We deploy the model in a challenging real-world online mar-
keting application. This scenario is significant and innova-
tive due to its realistic setting, allowing for multiple inter-
ventions over time and requiring decision-making from hun-
dreds of treatment options, including timing and content.
The sophisticated estimation of uplift enables an optimal
equilibrium between bundle GMV and shop GMV, thereby
achieving a 3.7% uplift in application-level revenue.

potential outcome models separately for the treatment and con-
trol groups [13, 20]. 2) Tree-based methods [22, 26] explicitly di-
vide sensitive users corresponding to each treatment using differ-
ent metrics as splitting criteria, offering interpretability. 3) Neu-
ral network-based methods leverage the advantages of neural net-
works to capture more complex and flexible relationships between
treatments and outcomes. With neural networks, models could learn
more unbiased information from observed data [23, 25]. Further-
more, some studies focus on utilizing deep learning to eliminate
the effect of confounders [17, 28]. Some studies pay more attention
to utilizing extra information for uplift estimation. For example,
DESCN [32] introduces the entire space from multi-task learning
to address distribution imbalance. EFIN [16] encodes not only user
and contextual features but treatment features. These methods can
only be applied to single-intervention scenarios in a static setting.
2.2 Causal Inference Over Time
Beyond the realm of uplift in online marketing, a few studies pay
attention to the sequence-to-sequence methods for estimating the
treatment effect in a dynamic view. Here, RMSN [14] uses RNN to
predict the inverse probability of treatment for training networks.
CRN [4] uses adversarial learning to produce balanced representa-
tions, which are simultaneously predictive of the outcome but non-
predictive of the current treatment assignment. DCRN [2] disen-
tangles the balancing representations into treatment, outcome and
confounder factor. CT [19] utilizes a Transformer into sequence en-
coding. These models are mainly intended for medical situations
where treatment and outcome events occur concurrently. While
we have adapted these algorithms to support temporal sequence
in the experimental section, due to their architecture, calculating
the uplift value of treatment on future outcomes remains a chal-
lenge for these algorithms.
2.3 Temporal Point Process
Temporal point processes (TPP) have gained attention as versatile
tools for generating sequences of discrete events in a continuous
timeline, finding applications across various domains [18, 24]. Re-
cently, the applications of neural networks in point process model-
ing have attracted significant attention. RMTPP [7] introduces re-
current neural networks instead of specifically fixed assumptionsto view the intensity function of a temporal point process. JUMP
[33] uses point process and sequential modeling techniques to pre-
dict dwell time based on three-layered RNN. CNTPP [30] incor-
porates the neural point process and Gaussian mixture models to
estimate the ITE of misinformation on social media.

tamp. ùëìùëñ

ùêømeans the total number of events in sequence. ùëéùëñ‚ààùëÖùëëùëéis a
vector that indicates which treatment option (also including the
option of no treatment) has been employed in ùëñ-th sample. ùë¶ùëñin-
dicates the actual outcomes. Choosing what feature of outcome
events as outcome ùë¶ùëñusually depends on the actual task. As de-
picted in Figure 1b, our goal is to estimate the causal effect of the
previous treatment event on the outcome event over time. Conse-
quently, followed by [30], the employed treatment option ùëéùëñis de-
cided by the last event. Specifically, if the previous event is a treat-
ment event, we consider that the current outcome event receives
the corresponding treatment. If the previous event is an outcome
event, we consider that the current event receives no treatment.
For simplicity, the superscript ùëñwill be omitted in the later part.
Following the potential outcome framework [8, 21], let ùë¶(ÀÜùëé)and
ùë¶(0)be the potential outcomes for each possible option of treat-
ment ÀÜùëéand for no treatment respectively. Then the objective of
this paper is to estimate the uplift of the treatment ÀÜùëéfor each out-
come event at the target timestamp which is defined as ùúè(ÀÜùëé, ùë°‚àó)=
ùë¶(ÀÜùëé, ùë°‚àó)‚àíùë¶(0, ùë°‚àó). However, we only have access to a single ob-
served outcome, which poses a challenge for uplift modeling as it
differs from traditional supervised learning. Thus, for each user,
the goal of uplift modeling is to estimate the expected ITE ùúè(ÀÜùëé, ùë°‚àó)
of each treatment ÀÜùëégiven history events ùëãand timestamp ùëá. It can
be formulated as:
ùúè(ÀÜùëé, ùë°‚àó)=ùê∏(ùë¶|ùëé=ÀÜùëé, ùë°=ùë°‚àó, ùëã,ùëá)‚àíùê∏(ùë¶(0)|ùëé=0, ùë°=ùë°‚àó, ùëã,ùëá)(1)

After obtaining all the ITE ùúè(ÀÜùëé, ùë°‚àó)for each of the treatment op-
tions ÀÜùëéand the candidate target timestamp ùë°‚àó, we can rank these
estimated ITEs and select the optimal treatment timestamp to as-
sign an effective treatment.
3.2 Marked Temporal Point Process
The marked temporal point process is a highly effective framework
for capturing the underlying mechanisms that govern the observed
patterns of random events over time [7]. By considering the tempo-
ral dependencies among events, we can develop models that explic-
itly account for the influence of past events on the timing of future
events. More formally, a marked temporal point process represents
a random process characterized by a sequence of discrete events,
each associated with a specific timing, denoted as ùë°, and a marker,
denoted as ùëì. In this paper, we assign the marker of an event (both
treatment and outcome) as its associated features. In this paper, the
marker ùëìcan be regarded same as feature ùëìin section 3.1.
By considering the historical sequence of events, we can explic-
itly characterize the marked temporal point process using the con-
ditional intensity function ùúÜ(ùëì , ùë°|ùêª)that the next event will hap-
pen at time ùë°with marker ùëìwhere ùêª=(ùëã,ùëá)is the historical
sequence of events and corresponding timestamp before ùë°. The in-
tensity function ùúÜ(ùëì , ùë°|ùêª)means the instantaneous probability of
the event occurring at time ùë°with marker ùëì[5]. Based on the in-
tensity function, we can derive the probability density function for
theùëó-th event, which occurs at time ùë°ùëówith marker ùëìùëó:
ùëù(ùëìùëó, ùë°ùëó|ùêªùëó)=ùúÜ(ùëìùëó, ùë°ùëó|ùêªùëó)ùëíùë•ùëù(‚àí‚à´ùë°ùëó
ùë°ùëó‚àí1ùúÜ(ùëìùëó, ùë°ùëó|ùêªùëó)ùëëùë°) (2)
In practical scenarios, to alleviate the complexities associated with
jointly and explicitly modeling both the timing and marker infor-
mation, several studies [5, 7] will factorize the intensity function
ùúÜ(ùëì , ùë°|ùêª)toùúÜ(ùë°|ùêª)ùëù(ùëì|ùêª).
4 METHOD
In this section, we present our proposed TPPUM and provide an
overview of its architecture. As depicted in Figure 3, given a se-
quence of previous events, the model first encodes both treatment
events and outcome events jointly to obtain their representation ùúô
which includes the sequential relations among these events. Sub-
sequently, we leverage the representation ùúôto model the intensity
function ùúÜ(ùë°|ùêª)and the marker‚Äôs probability ùëù(ùëì|ùêª)by neural net-
work. The intensity function will be further used to predict the tim-
ing of the next outcome event. For features of the next outcome
event, we construct an outcome predictor to predict them. During
the training process, we introduce adversarial learning techniques
to ensure that the embedding representation ùúôstrikes a balance
between being predictive of outcomes and not being predictive of
treatments. Finally, we can utilize the estimated intensity function
and marker‚Äôs probability to predict the timing and marker of the
next event.
4.1 Balancing Representation Encoding
In order to formulate the process of treatment and outcome events
as a unified marked temporal point process, we need to capture the
complex dependencies within the historical event sequences basedon the sequence encoder. Specifically, we first design two separate
mapping functions because of the inherent differences between the
features of treatment and outcome events. These functions are re-
sponsible for mapping the timing and features of events (ùëì , ùë°)into
the embedding(f,t). Then we feed them into the sequence encoder
as depicted in Figure 3 to generate the representation ùúô. To ensure
unbiased estimation, it is crucial to obtain the balancing representa-
tion ùúôin a manner that is invariant to treatments. We will provide
a detailed explanation of how we achieve the balancing encoding
in Section 4.4.
4.2 Point Process Learning
As discussed in Section 2.3, we model the marked temporal point
process (MTPP) by learning the intensity function ùúÜ(ùë°|ùêª)and mark-
ers‚Äô probability ùëù(ùëì|ùêª)based on balancing representation ùúôsepa-
rately. MTPP stands out for its ability in modeling events within
continuous timelines, which is instrumental in accurately captur-
ing the stochastic nature of event timings along with the under-
lying intensity function. This capability is particularly beneficial
for our application, which aims not only to determine the most
appropriate treatment options but also to identify the optimal tim-
ing for presenting these recommendations to players. The unique
ability of MTPP to model time accurately provides flexibility in
making treatment decisions about when to offer treatments and
what treatments bring in the future, which is particularly critical
in addressing the challenges presented by the irregular timing of
treatment and outcome events observed in online marketing.
4.2.1 Intensity Learning. For the intensity function ùúÜ(ùë°|ùêª), previ-
ous studies [29, 30] have demonstrated the effectiveness of a multi-
layer perceptron (MLP) in modeling intensity functions. Building
upon these findings, we employ an MLP architecture in this paper
to explicitly learn the intensity function. In addition, to avoid the
complex calculation of the integral involved in the intensity func-
tion, we choose to directly fit the integral of the intensity with
neural networks. By obtaining the gradient of the fitted integral
with respect to the time, we can effectively estimate the intensity
function. The process can be formulated as follows:
ùêºùë°=‚à´ùë°
ùë°‚àíùúÜ(ùë°|ùêª)‚Üê ùúé(ùë§2(ùúé(ùë§1[ùúô;(ùë°‚àíùë°‚àí)]+ùëè1))+ùëè2)
ùúÜ(ùë°|ùêª)=ùëëùêºùë°
ùëë
ùë°(3)
where ùë§1, ùë§2, ùëè1, ùëè2are trainable parameters of MLP and ùúéis ac-
tivation function set as Elu. ùë°‚àímeans the last event‚Äôs timestamp
before the current event. Note that we concatenate ùúôwith the time
interval ùë°‚àíùë°‚àíto feed into MLP because definite integral‚à´ùë°
ùë°‚àíùúÜ(ùë°|ùêª)
involves the accumulation from the previous event to the current
event in time.
4.2.2 Marker Learning. For the marker‚Äôs probability, a straightfor-
ward solution is to assume the markers‚Äô distribution as Gaussian
distribution and apply a neural network to fit the parameters of a
Gaussian distribution. However, the marker of both treatment and
outcome events is not guaranteed to conform to Gaussian distri-
bution. Thus we apply representation learning to derive markers‚Äô

mulated as:
ùëíùëë=ùúé(ùë§4(ùúé(ùë§3ùúô+ùëè3))+ùëè4) (4)
where ùëíùëëmeans the representation of markers.
4.3 Marker Prediction
By building an outcome predictor ùëÇ(ùúô, ùúÜ, ùëí ùëë), the prediction of mark-
ers of the next outcome event can be formulated as follows:
ÀÜùëì=ùëÇ(ùúô, ùúÜ(ùë°|ùêª), ùëíùëë) (5)
where ÀÜùëì‚ààùëÖùëëùëìmeans the predicted markers of the next outcome
event. Since we focus on the ITE estimation, we only need to use
the outcome ÀÜùë¶included in ÀÜùëìwhich will be elaborated in section
4.5.
4.4 Training
4.4.1 Point Process Training. Based on Equation (2), the log-likelihood
of the marked event (ùëì , ùë°)and point process loss can be formulated
as follows:

which will be elaborated in Section 4.3.2.
4.4.2 Adversarial Training. As discussed in Section 1, the history
of events contains the time-varying confounders that bias the treat-
ment assignment in the observational data. Merely minimizing theloss function during model training could result in biased uplift pre-
dictions. To tackle this issue, we integrate the domain adversarial
technique into the training process with the aim of acquiring a bal-
ancing representation denoted ùúô. The objective is to eliminate the
future treatment information from ùúô, ensuring that the probability
of receiving any specific treatment remains the same for any two
users with different historical events. Formally, it can be expressed
asùëù(ùëé|ùêª0)=ùëù(ùëé|ùêª1),‚àÄùëé‚ààùë°ùëüùëíùëéùë°ùëöùëíùëõùë°ùëúùëùùë°ùëñùëúùëõùë† . Specifically, the ad-
versarial training involves the min-max game:
ùëöùëñùëõ ùúôùëöùëéùë• ÀÜùëùEùêªùëôùëúùëîÀÜùëù(ùëé|ùúô(ùêª)) (7)
where ùúôrepresents the representation of historical sequence ùêªand
ÀÜùëù(ùëé|ùúô(ùêª)is the prediction of treatment given representation ùúô. Ac-
cording to [4, 30], the solution ùúôensures ùëù(ùúô(ùêª)|ùëé1)=ùëù(ùúô(ùêª)|ùëé2)
for any ùëé1, ùëé2if it reaches Nash balanced.
In practice, the adversarial training approach aims to simulta-
neously minimize the outcome loss and maximize the treatment
loss. To achieve this, we introduce an outcome predictor denoted
asùëÇ(ùúô, ùúÜ, ùëí ùëë). Additionally, we construct a treatment classifier de-
noted as ùê∂(ùúô). Furthermore, we leverage the Gradient Reversal
Layer (GRL) [9] between the balancing representation and the treat-
ment predictor to reverse the sign of the gradient. GRL could facil-
itate adversarial training during backpropagation. The treatment
loss and outcome loss are defined as follows:
ùêøùëé=ùëëùëé‚àë
ùëó=1I[ùëé=ùëéùëó]ùëôùëúùëî(ùê∂(ùê∫ùëÖùêø(ùúô)))

ùëñ=1ùêøùë¶‚àíùõºùêøùëé(8)
where ùõºis a hyper-parameter for domain adversarial and ùëÅis the
number of samples in the dataset. Thereby, the time-varying con-
founding bias will be removed from balancing representation. Fi-
nally, we train the model with the summarization of the loss func-
tion including ùêøùëùandùêøùëèùëéùëôùëéùëõùëêùëí .

Inference
During the evaluation stage in offline experiments, to estimate the
uplift about the next outcome event given current treatment event
ÀÜùëé, we follow a two-step process. Firstly, we predict the potential
outcomes ÀÜùë¶(ÀÜùëé)and ÀÜùë¶(0)based on the sequence of historical events
ùêª, considering the presence or absence of the current treatment
event. To estimate the counterfactual outcomes, we conduct this in
two scenarios. If the factual treatment option is treated, we remove
the last treatment event and construct the counterfactual historical
sequence ùêªùëêùëì. If the factual treatment option is untreated, we add a
simulated treatment event to construct ùêªùëêùëì. Its features are consis-
tent with the last factual treatment event and its occurrence time
is set to 24 hours after the last event. The counterfactual outcome
ÀÜùë¶(0)orÀÜùë¶(ÀÜùëé)is predicted given ùêªùëêùëìSubsequently, we calculate the
uplift as the difference between these predicted outcomes, denoted
asùúè(ÀÜùëé)=ÀÜùë¶(ÀÜùëé)‚àíÀÜùë¶(0).
On the other hand, in real-world applications, the accurate tim-
ing of the next outcome event is not always knowable, that is, we
cannot directly predict the outcome as described in Equation 4. To
address this limitation, we propose to predict the expected out-
come within a specific time window, which can be formulated as
follows:
ùê∏(ÀÜùë¶)=‚à´ùë°+ùëä
ùë°ùúÜ(ùë°|ùêª)ùëÇ(ùúô, ùúÜ(ùë°|ùêª))ùëëùë° (9)
where ùëäis a hyper-parameter means the length of the time win-
dow. Similarly, we can obtain uplift ùúè(ÀÜùëé)by calculating the differ-
ence expected outcome ùê∏(ÀÜùë¶(ÀÜùëé))andùê∏(ÀÜùë¶(0)).
5 EXPERIMENTS
5.1 Experimental Settings
5.1.1 Baselines. The study of uplift modeling over time applied
to temporal event sequences remains unexplored in previous re-
search efforts. To address this research gap, we carefully select a
set of methods that demonstrate proficiency in estimating treat-
ment effects based on event sequences over time, including CRN
[4], DCRN [2], and CT [19].
‚Ä¢CRN: CRN uses adversarial training to construct treatment
invariant representation, which aims to address the bias from
time-varying confounders.
‚Ä¢DCRN: DCRN disentangles the representation of event se-
quences into three latent factors to allow better time-varying
confounder modeling.
‚Ä¢CT: CT designs the encoder based on the Transformer and
cross-attention network which can model more complex and
long-range time-varying confounders.Since DCRN is only applied to binary treatment scenarios, to eval-
uate it in multi-treatment scenarios, we make some extendence.
Specifically, the origin binary-setting discrepancy measure in the
loss function involves the calculation ùëëùëñùë†ùëê(Oùëé=0
ùë°,Oùëé=1
ùë°), we extend
it to the multi-treatment scenario by calculating the distance be-
tween two of the multiple Oùëé
ùë°and add them together. Furthermore,
in order to enable the baselines to leverage temporal information,
we have incorporated the time gap from the previous event as an
additional input for each time step of the baselines.
5.1.2 Datasets. We conduct the experiments on both the synthetic
and real-world data. The statistics of real-world data are presented
in Table 1. The generation of synthetic datasets will be described
in the Appendix in detail. The datasets include:
‚Ä¢GAME: This is real-world industrial data collected from an
online game. It includes bundle recommendation logs and
users‚Äô in-shop purchase logs. Bundle recommendations are
treated as the events triggering treatment, while user pur-
chases in the shop are considered as the outcome events.
‚Ä¢Synthetic GAME: Motivated by [30], we create a simula-
tion of an online game recommendation scenario. The fea-
ture is the same as used in the ‚ÄùGAME‚Äù dataset while the
distribution is more balanced. Events in the simulation were
modeled using a Hawkes process.
‚Ä¢Hawkes-Tumor: Followed by [2, 4, 19], we generated Tu-
mor data based on a state-of-the-art biomedical model [10]
to simulate the effects of tumor cancer treatments over time.
Furthermore, to enhance the consistency of the data with
event sequences, the outcome event was simulated as the
observation event on tumor growth based on the Hawkes
process.
5.1.3 Data Preparation. For GAME datasets, the treatment assign-
ment is selective with high selection bias due to the recommenda-
tion strategy, and we use these data as the training set. We also
choose another set of users whose treatment assignments are un-
der randomized controlled trials (RCT) and we use them as the test
set. For Synthetic GAME datasets, we generated event sequences of
8,000 users for training and another 1,000 users for validation and
testing respectively. In this dataset, the feature sets in the GAME
for recommendation and purchase events are the same. Consequently,
we utilized a single embedding layer to transform these two event
types. We choose the prediction of shop revenue to evaluate the
prediction performance. In the case of Hawkes-Tumor, we select
the time-varying coefficient in ùõæ‚àà {0,1,3,5,7,10}. For each ùõæ,
we first simulated 10,000 patients‚Äô treatment trajectories and cor-
responding tumor size data for training, and 1000 patients‚Äô data
for validation and testing respectively. To enhance this data with
time information, we extended the outcome event by introducing
observational events linked to tumor size. Subsequently, we sam-
pled timestamps using the Hawkes process to construct an out-
come event sequence. The outcome values (tumor size) and treat-
ment were determined based on previous and subsequent know-
able events in the sequence. We will elaborate the process in the
Appendix.
5.1.4 Metrics. In line with the experimental setup adopted in CRN [4],
for the synthetic dataset, we employ two evaluation metrics, namely
6252Temporal Uplift Modeling for Online Marketing KDD ‚Äô24, August 25‚Äì29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Precision in Estimation of
Heterogeneous Effect (pEHE) [1], to assess the performance of mod-
els on outcome and uplift predictions. We begin by predicting the
outcome value and uplift for each user‚Äôs outcome event. Subse-
quently, we calculate the RMSE by comparing the predicted out-
come values with the true outcome values. Similarly, we compute
pEHE by comparing the predicted uplift values with the true up-
lift values. For the real-world dataset, the unobservability of the
counterfactual outcome prevents us from accessing the true uplift.
Consequently, we evaluate the uplift ranking performance using
a widely adopted metric in uplift modeling, namely the area un-
der the Qini curve (QINI). Higher Qini indicates the better perfor-
mance of the model in the uplift task. It should be noticed that al-
though RMSE can be calculated without counterfactual outcomes
and measures the prediction of factual outcomes in real-world datasets,
it does not provide insights into the effectiveness of uplift model-
ing, particularly in data with inherent selection bias. This limita-
tion arises because RMSE fails to account for how outcomes vary
across different treatment options at the individual level. Conse-
quently, few studies employ RMSE in real-world datasets.
5.1.5 Implementation Details. We implement our model in PyTorch
1.10.1. We use an Adam optimizer and set the number of epochs to
100. During validation, we use RMSE as the evaluation metric for
searching the best hyper-parameters. To ensure the robustness and
reliability of our evaluations, we conducted each experiment five
times and computed the average results.

gree of bias coefficient ùõæ. A higher ùõævalue indicates a greater
presence of bias within the dataset.
5.2 Performance Evaluation
Because the Hawkes Tumor dataset has 6 subsets with different
bias coefficients ùúÜ, we depict the comparison results on the Hawkes
Tumor dataset in Figure 3 for direct visualization and show results
on the GAME and synthetic GAME datasets in Table 2. In real-
world scenarios, we are often limited to observing only one poten-
tial outcome. However, using synthetic data offers a distinct advan-
tage by providing access to counterfactual outcomes. This unique
capability empowers us to explicitly evaluate the predictions of
counterfactual outcomes, enabling a comprehensive assessment of
models. Note that the RMSE in Figure 3 is normalized by the maxi-
mum tumor volume 1150. From the results in Figure 3, we can have
the following observations:Table 2: The results of the comparison methods on Synthetic
GAME dataset and real-world GAME dataset. The best per-
formance on each dataset is highlighted with bold font.

performs poorly among all baselines in most cases. It
may be attributed to the complicated architecture of its attention-
based encoder. Especially in Synthetic GAME, The time-dependent
confounding introduced by complex, feature-laden treatments
and treatment sequences leads to a higher risk of overfitting
for CT.
‚Ä¢Our TPPUM consistently outperforms all baselines on two
Synthetic datasets in most cases. Especially when bias coef-
ficient ùõæ=10, TPPUM improves by 34.57%on RMSE. While
CRN and DCRN also employ RNN for encoding event se-
quences within the counterfactual framework, TPPUM sur-
passes them by adopting a distinctive approach that treats
users‚Äô event sequences as uniform marked point processes.
This unique methodology effectively alleviates the challenges
associated with the distribution of continuous-time events
in complex scenarios of online marketing. Furthermore, our
model excels in enhancing predictions of the next events
on the timeline, resulting from its incorporation of intensity
function and markers‚Äô distribution representations. This aug-
mentation provides a distinct advantage compared to rely-
ing solely on the neural network-based predictor.
For the real-world GAME dataset, the Qini score measures the
ranking performance according to predicted uplift and is applied in
areas where ground truth uplift is unknown. As shown in Table 2,
our proposed TPPUM surpasses the best baselines by 8.8470% ,17.3335%
and 7.8947% on RMSE, pEHE and Qini respectively. Similar to the
performance in Synthetic data, CT still suffers from its complicated
encoder and achieves the worst performance. Our TPPUM con-
sistently outperforms other baselines in the GAME dataset. This
achievement stems from the model‚Äôs ability to efficiently capture
the dynamics of users‚Äô events along the timeline through point pro-
cess modeling. The results of previous experiments validate the sig-
nificant effectiveness of TPPUM in the uplift task.
5.3 Ablation Study
Moreover, we conduct ablation studies of our TPPUM to analyze
the importance of each part. We consider the following variants of
TPPUM.
‚Ä¢TPPUM w/o T: A model variant that removes adversarial
balancing representation learning.
6253KDD‚Äô24, August 25‚Äì29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Xin Zhang, et al.
‚Ä¢TPPUM w/o I: A model variant that removes intensity learn-
ing from outcome prediction.
The results are shown in Figure 3 and Table 2. Specifically, when
removing adversarial training to conduct balancing encoding of
event sequences, the model performance has a decline. It is mainly
due to the bias from time-varying confounders that confuse the
model on the treatment effect. A surprising phenomenon is that
even after removing the balancing encoding, TPPUM w/o T still
outperforms baselines in the synthetic GAME dataset. We specu-
late that the reason is a relatively lower treatment bias in the Syn-
thetic GAME dataset compared to other datasets and thus the vari-
ant could retain a great performance via point process learning.
When the model removes the intensity from point process learn-
ing and only preserves the marker for outcome prediction, it will
also bring performance degradation. This validates the effective-
ness of intensity learning, i.e., the estimated intensity can provide
a mathematical characterization of the distribution of future event
occurrences, which is crucial for counterfactual outcome predic-
tion.
6 ONLINE DEPLOYMENT
We applied our proposed TPPUM in one of the most popular games1
released by NetEase Games2for providing online marketing service
by recommending discounted bundles to users. Figure 4 presents
a graphical process of the application. There are two types of user
purchase events: one involves users purchasing the recommended
discounted bundle at a reduced price, while the other involves users
making purchases at the original price in the in-game shop. The
latter can be considered as user-initiated purchases resulting from
spontaneous demand. User interaction with the application is di-
vided into four parts. Firstly, during the gameplay, users may trig-
ger bundle treatment due to various predefined conditions with
an approximate frequency of 30 times per day (Step 1). The strat-
egy will determine whether to make an intervention (Step 2) and
then decide the contents of the discounted bundle (Step 3). The
bundle consists of multiple item IDs and their corresponding item
quantities, and the discount is determined by manual rules. Note
that bundle treatments are limited to an average of 3~4 opportuni-
ties per day, not every user-triggered event will result in a recom-
mendation. This necessitates the need for decision-making regard-
ing the timing of interventions. Then user will receive a pop-up
window and have 30 minutes to decide whether to make a pur-
chase. Undoubtedly, the recommendation of discounted bundles
(i.e., treatment) will influence user spending in the in-game shop
(i.e., outcomes) through substitution effects and demand stimula-
tion effects. Therefore, for this online marketing problem, we need
to dynamically select the optimal treatment and timing based on
real-time user context to maximize the total Gross Merchandise
Volume (GMV) from bundle sales and shop transactions. This relies
on accurately estimating the counterfactual uplift of treatments.
During a two-week online A/B testing, we conducted a compar-
ative analysis of Transformer [27], CRN [4], and TPPUM. Trans-
former is the existing baseline without uplift prediction. It was

previously employed in live deployment, with a primary focus on
maximizing revenue in gift bundle scenarios. On the other hand,
CRN represents a widely-used causal inference algorithm for se-
quential treatment but is limited to discrete time series and 1-step
outcome prediction. To enable compatibility with CRN, we defined
a time step as three hours and consolidated multiple treatments oc-
curring within the same time step. In the uplift inference phase of
CRN, the objective was formulated to maximize the revenue from
the current time step‚Äôs treatment, combined with the outcome rev-
enue (i.e., the in-game shop). The uplift inference process of TP-
PUM has been described in Section 4.5. We set the time window
ùëäto be 24 hours. The TPPUM network‚Äôs single inference time
is 100-150 milliseconds with a GPU device and 300-400 millisec-
onds with a CPU device. As depicted in Figure 5, the results from
a 14-day A/B test indicate that, compared to the baseline scenario
of only optimizing the bundle, TPPUM suffered a certain loss in
GMV within the bundle scenario. This loss, however, was compen-
sated by a growth in the overall GMV of bundle plus shop (3.6%).
On the other hand, CRN adopted a more aggressive strategy. How-
ever, a higher loss in bundle GMV (-8.9%) did not lead to a higher
shop GMV, resulting in a decrease in the overall GMV of bundle
plus shop by 1.8%. On Sundays (the 6th and the 13th day), TPPUM
achieved significant growth in both bundle and shop compared to
other baselines by providing bundles with only smaller discounts.
This demonstrates that TPPUM accurately estimated the uplift of
discount bundle sequence on users‚Äô purchase behavior in in-game
6254Temporal Uplift Modeling for Online Marketing KDD ‚Äô24, August 25‚Äì29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
shop, thus enabling the selection of the best treatment and recom-
mendation timing, ultimately leading to an increase in overall user
purchases in both scenarios.
7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, to address the task of uplift estimation in complex
marketing scenarios, where users receive multiple interventions
over time, we propose a temporal point process-based uplift mod-
eling network, named TPPUM. By modeling the historical events
sequence as a marked temporal point process, we estimate the
future intensity and the markers‚Äô based on balancing representa-
tion. Here, the model could evaluate the treatment effect on in-
dividual users by event prediction. We deployed the model into
a real-world online marketing application with a significant im-
provement. The combination of causal inference and more sophis-
ticated time-series point process methods will be one of the future
research directions.

SYNTHETIC DATASET GENERATION
In the experiment, we use two synthetic datasets including the syn-
thetic GAME dataset and the Hawkes-Tumor dataset. In this sec-
tion, we introduce how to generate these two datasets based on the
Hawkes process.
A.1 Synthetic GAME
In the generation of Synthetic GAME, motivated by [30] that uses
hidden vectors to represent users and news and simulate the se-
quence of users by modeling Hawkes process. On the basis of this
idea, we first randomly initialize the embeddings of users ùë¢and
items ùëñand the parameters of various functions and then define the
intensity function of the gift bundle recommendation event and in-
shop purchase event as:
ùúÜùëî(ùëìùëî, ùë°ùëî|ùêª)=ùë¢ùëìùëîùëñùëì ùë°(ùëìùëî)+‚àë
(ùëìùëô,ùë°ùëô)‚ààùêªùëíùë°ùëô‚àíùë°ùëìùë£ùëéùëôùë¢ùëí(ùëìùëîùëñùëì ùë°(ùëìùëô))
ùúÜùë†(ùëìùë†, ùë°ùë†|ùêª)=ùë¢ùëìùë†‚Ñéùëúùëù(ùëìùë†)+‚àë
(ùëìùëô,ùë°ùëô)‚ààùêªùëíùë°ùëô‚àíùë°ùëìùë£ùëéùëôùë¢ùëí(ùëìùë†‚Ñéùëúùëù(ùëìùëô‚àóùëôùëéùëèùëíùëô))
(10)
where ùëìùëî, ùëìùë†are features of gift bundle recommendation and in-
shop purchase events including items‚Äô embedding, number of items
and discount. ùêªdenotes the historical events including both gift
bundle recommendations and in-shop purchases. ùëôùëéùëèùëíùëô indicates
if items are purchased. ùëìùëîùëñùëì ùë°()and ùëìùë†‚Ñéùëúùëù()transform the event‚Äôs
features to the representation of values of items. ùëìùë£ùëéùëôùë¢ùëí()ensures
items‚Äô value in history events are measurable in Hawkes process.
Additionally, unlike in-shop purchase events, the results of gift
bundle recommendations are classified as bought and not bought.
We extra define the probability of recommended gifts bought by
users as:
ùëùùëî(ùëìùëî|ùêª)=ùë†ùëñùëîùëöùëúùëñùëë(ùë¢ùëìùë£ùëéùëôùë¢ùëí(ùëìùëî)+1
ùêø‚àë
(ùëìùëô,
ùë°ùëô)‚ààùêª(ùëìùë£ùëéùëôùë¢ùëí(ùëìùëô))+ùëõùëúùëñùë†ùëí
(11)
The process is described in Algorithm 1.
A.2 Hawkes-Tumor
In the generation of Hawkes-Tumor, we first simulate patients‚Äô
data following [4]. For ùëô-th time step ùë°ùëô, a patient has the corre-
sponding tumor size ùë¶ùëô, treatments ùëéùëôand counterfactual tumor
ùë¶ùëêùëì
ùëôsize with other treatment options. Then we define the outcome
event as the observation of tumor size. The intensity function of the
outcome event can be defined as:
ùúÜùëú(ùë°|ùêª)=ùêºùëèùëéùë†ùëí+‚àë
ùë°ùëô‚ààùêªùõº(ùëíùõΩ(ùë°ùëô‚àíùë°))) (12)
where ùêºùëèùëéùë†ùëí is a randomly generate base intensity and ùõº, ùõΩ are
hyper-parameters. The process is described in Algorithm 2.
