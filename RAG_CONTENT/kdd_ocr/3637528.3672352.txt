Abstract
Online controlled experiments play a crucial role in enabling data-
driven decisions across a wide range of companies. Variance re-
duction is an effective technique to improve the sensitivity of ex-
periments, achieving higher statistical power while using fewer
samples and shorter experimental periods. However, typical vari-
ance reduction methods (e.g., regression-adjusted estimators) are
built upon the intuitional assumption of Gaussian distributions and
cannot properly characterize the real business metrics with heavy-
tailed distributions. Furthermore, outliers diminish the correlation
between pre-experiment covariates and outcome metrics, greatly
limiting the effectiveness of variance reduction.
In this paper, we develop a novel framework that integrates the
Student‚Äôsùë°-distribution with machine learning tools to fit heavy-
tailed metrics and construct a robust average treatment effect es-
timator in online controlled experiments, which we call STATE.
By adopting a variational EM method to optimize the loglikehood
function, we can infer a robust solution that greatly eliminates the

1 Introduction
Online controlled experiments (also known as A/B tests) are the
most widely adopted method for measuring causal effects, and

play a crucial role in enabling data-driven decisions across a wide
range of companies, including Facebook [ 3,13], Airbnb [ 8,10],
Google [ 14], Microsoft [ 9] and LinkedIn [ 15,26]. These experiments
are critical for businesses, as even small differences detected in key
metrics can have significant implications for the total revenue [ 9].
For example, a strategy that increases one user‚Äôs revenue by $0.1
can result in millions of dollars in the total revenue for ten million
users.
In the typical settings of controlled experiments, online traffic
is randomly partitioned into two groups: a treatment group and a
control group. They keep almost the same configuration except that
the treatment group receives an additional intervention (e.g., a new
production version or a promotion email). The average treatment
effect (ATE) measures the causal effect of a treatment or interven-
tion, but its groundtruth is unknown. Thanks to the central limit
theorem, the difference-in-means estimator (DIM) produces an un-
biased estimation of ATE, which is calculated by the difference
between the treatment and control group outcomes.
Although DIM offers unbiased estimates, it still suffers from
high variance, further leading to poor sensitivity and low statisti-
cal power. For online businesses, the sensitivity of experiments is
particularly important. With thousands of experiments run each
year, any benefits of increased sensitivity will be amplified due to
economies of scale. On the other hand, the improvement in sensi-
tivity allows experiments to be run on a smaller user population or
for shorter durations while achieving the same statistical power. It
is significant for improving the product feedback cycle and agility.
In mathematics, variance reduction techniques are used to ob-
tain higher precision for the metric of interest and have been in-
troduced to online controlled experiments recently. For examples,
CUPED [ 9] utilizes pre-experiment covariates to reduce metric vari-
ability between the treatment and control groups, constructing an
unbiased estimator with lower variance. However, the effectiveness
is limited by the linear assumption and the correlation between
the covariates and outcome metrics. Hence, to develop a nonlinear
multi-covariate proxy that is highly correlated with the outcome
metric, several machine learning (ML) based estimators have been
explored [ 2,13,15,24,25]. CUPAC [ 23] and MLRATE [ 13] are two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) estimators in this class, both of which are
based on the regression-adjusted method. To tackle the optimal-
ity, Yin [ 15] has demonstrated that if ML predicators converge to
the conditional mean function, the asymptotic variance of ATE
estimators can reach the semi-parametric variance lower bound.
Notably, the discussion on optimality is conducted under the
assumption that the regression residuals follow a Gaussian distri-
bution. However the business metrics of interest are often heavy-
tailed (e.g., watch time on video sites, user Gross Merchandise Vol-
ume(GMV) on e-commerce platforms, the amount of live broadcast
rewards, etc.). The observations for these metrics usually contain
some outliers (observations far away from the bulk of the probabil-
ity density). The significant impact of outliers on the squared loss
may lead to bias and high variance in the ATE estimates. As shown
in Fig. 1, the residuals of user GMV on the Meituan food delivery
platform exhibit a heavy-tailed distribution due to the presence of
users with extremely high-priced orders. In the Gaussian distribu-
tion, the probability of observations falling beyond six standarddeviations should be extremely small (less than 0.0000002%). How-
ever, it is obvious that a larger portion of the observations exceeds
six standard deviation in Fig. 1. Therefore, the Gaussian distribution
does not properly characterize heavy-tailed metrics.

sample count. The X-axis represents the residuals between
the real value and the model predicted value, where the ex-
tremely large values are clipped to the upper bound.
To address this problem, we introduce the Student‚Äôs ùë°-distribution
to variance reduction. The Gaussian distribution is a special case of
theùë°-distribution, corresponding to the situation where the degree
of freedom tend to infinity. As the degree of freedom decreases,
theùë°-distribution has heavier tails, giving non-zero probability to
observations that fall outside the bulk of the density. This char-
acteristic endows the ùë°-distribution with an important property
called robustness. As is shown in Fig. 1, the GMV metric can be
better characterized when the regression residuals are modeled as
a generalized ùë°-distribution.
In this paper, we mainly focus on the variance reduction of
ATE estimation of heavy-tailed metrics, and propose an easy-to-
implement robust ATE estimator, called STATE. Specifically, our
work has the following key contributions.
‚Ä¢We integrate the machine learning regression adjustment
method with the Student‚Äôs ùë°-distribution to estimate ATE for
count metrics and derive a variational EM framework to infer
parameters. The estimation procedure takes full advantage
of both the powerful fitting ability of machine learning tools
and the robustness of the ùë°-distribution to outliers, thereby
significantly reducing the variance of ATE estimation in
online controlled experiments.
‚Ä¢We extend this method to ratio metrics, which are more
complex but less investigated. We introduce linear transfor-
mation for ratio metrics while preserve unbiased estimation
and consistent variance, under which regression-adjusted
methods and the Student‚Äôs ùë°-distribution can be introduced
to reduce variance and improve sensitivity.

real business data on the Meituan food delivery platform to

verify the effectiveness of our method in this paper. Exten-
sive experimental results demonstrate that when the met-
rics follow Gaussian distribution, the STATE method per-
forms equivalently to the state-of-the-art estimators (CU-
PAC/MLRATE). When the metric is a heavy-tailed distri-
bution, our method can reduce the variance by about 50%
compared to the CUPAC and MLRATE. This indicates that we
can achieve the same statistical power in online controlled
experiments with only half of the observations, or half the
experimental duration.
2 Setup and Related Work
2.1 Setup
Letùëãbe the pre-experiment covariates, ùëábe the binary treat-
ment variable, and ùëå,ùëç be two outcome variables. In an online
controlled experiment, suppose that there are ùëÅsamples denoted
by(ùëãùëñ,ùëáùëñ,ùëåùëñ,ùëçùëñ), which are drawn independently from an identical
distribution. The treatment ùëá‚àà{0,1}is assigned randomly and
independently of the covariates ùëã, whereùëáùëñ=1represents that the
ùëñ-th sample receives the treatment. Denote the number of samples
withùëáùëñ=1andùëáùëñ=0byùëÅùë°andùëÅùëê, repectively. Following the
Rubin Causal Model (RCM) [ 21], letùëåùëñ(1),ùëçùëñ(1),ùëåùëñ(0),ùëçùëñ(0)be the
corresponding potential outcome when the sample is assigned with
the treatment or not.
The count metrics are defined as the sample means (e.g.,√ç
ùëáùëñ=1ùëåùëñ
ùëÅùë°),
whose analysis unit is exactly the randomization unit in experi-
ments. The average treatment effect (ATE) for count metrics is
ùúèùëê=ùê∏[ùëåùëñ(1)]‚àíùê∏[ùëåùëñ(0)].
The common difference-in-mean (DIM) estimator is taken as
Œîùëå=√ç
ùëáùëñ=1ùëåùëñ
ùëÅùë°‚àí√ç
ùëáùëñ=0ùëåùëñ
ùëÅùëê. (1)
According to the central limit theorem, it gives an unbiased estima-
tion ofùúèùëêwith the variance ùê∑[Œîùëå]=ùúé2
ùë°/ùëÅùë°+ùúé2ùëê/ùëÅùëê, whereùúé2
ùë°,ùúé2ùëê
are the variance of samples in the treatment group and control
group respectively.
The ratio metrics are usually regarded as the ratio of two count
metrics, e.g.,√ç
ùëáùëñ=1ùëåùëñ√ç
ùëáùëñ=1ùëçùëñ. For ratio metrics, ATE is defined as
ùúèùëü=ùê∏[ùëåùëñ(1)]
ùê∏[ùëçùëñ(1)]‚àíùê∏[ùëåùëñ(0)]
ùê∏[ùëçùëñ(0)].
The corresponding DIM estimator is
ŒîùëÖ=√ç
ùëáùëñ=1ùëåùëñ√ç
ùëáùëñ=1ùëçùëñ‚àí√ç
ùëáùëñ=0ùëåùëñ√ç
ùëáùëñ=0ùëçùëñ. (2)
Notice that DIM is not an unbiased estimator because
ùê∏[ŒîùëÖ]‚â†ùúèùëü.
Fortunately, it gives a consistent estimation for ùúèùëüaccording to the
delta method [7].
2.2 Related Work
Variance reduction is a key technology and a longstanding chal-
lenge to improve the sensitivity of online control experiments. The
original literatures mainly discuss the univariate linear adjustment
method [ 9,12,17,27]. For instance, the CUPED [ 9] estimator, whichis widely applied in industry, utilizes relevant covariate from the
pre-experiment period to reduce the variability of the outcome met-
ric, and shows that the higher correlation between covariate and
outcome, the better the performance of variance reduction. Alter-
natively, an equivalent technique to CUPED is the linear regression
method,ùëåùëñ=ùëé0+ùëé1ùëáùëñ+ùëé2ùëãùëñ+ùúñùëñ, which assumes the outcome is a
linear combination of the treatment effect and the covariate term.
To overcome the limitations of the linear model, researchers
have explored multivariate adjustment methods [ 2,13,15,23‚Äì25]
by introducing the cross-fitting technique [ 6,28] and ‚Äúagnostic‚Äù
regression [ 12,17]. Typically, they utilize many covariates in a ma-
chine learning(ML) model ùëîpredictingùëåfromùëãto develop a proxy
variableùëî(ùëã). Subsequently, estimate the ATE in a linear regression
modelùëåùëñ=ùëé0+ùëé1ùëáùëñ+ùëé2ùëî(ùëãùëñ)+ùúñùëñ. Since the proxy incorporates
more prior information about the outcome, it generates further
variance reduction gains.
However, the regression-adjusted methods assume that the resid-
ualùúñfollows a Gaussian distribution, which is not applicable to
the heavy-tailed metrics in online businesses. If outliers are not
properly dealt with, they may lead to bias and high variance in
parameter estimation.
Furthermore, the majority of variance reduction methods focus
on count metrics. In fact, ratio metrics are equally important in prac-
tice, and are more complex but less investigated. Existing solutions
for ratio metric are mostly extensions to those of count metrics.
For examples, researchers utilize the delta method to extend the
CUPED estimator to the variance reduction of ratio metrics. The
study conducted by [ 15] focuses on ratio metrics by separately
minimizing the variances of the numerator and denominator, but
disregards their correlation. A novel work proposed in [ 4] is the
consistent transformation, which transforms ratio metrics into user-
level linear metrics. However, it is based on a strong hypothesis
where the denominator in ratio metrics is extremely large and can
be approximatively taken as a constant.
In this paper, we develop more efficient estimators for count met-
rics and ratio metrics respectively. For count metrics, we propose a
robust estimator called STATE by modeling the regression residual
as a Student‚Äôs ùë°-distribution which was put forth and adopted as a ro-
bust building block, for clustering [ 20,22] and robust projections[ 1].
The heavy-tailed nature of the ùë°-distribution makes it much less sen-
sitive to outliers compared to the Gaussian distribution, resulting in
a substantial reduction in the variance of the ATE estimate. For ratio
metrics, we adopt the main idea of the transformation method [ 4]
while relaxing its assumptions, and introduce STATE method for
ratio metrics to decrease the negative influence of outliers.
3 Robust Estimation for Count Metrics with
STATE
3.1 Robust Modeling
Following the framework of typical regression adjustment tech-
niques, our proposed ATE estimation procedure can be summarized
in two stages: machine learning stage and linear regression stage.
Machine learning stage: utilize machine learning tools ùëîto cap-
ture the relationship between the outcome metric ùëåand the covari-
atesùëã. Then, we can obtain a proxy variable ÀÜùëåùëñ[13,23] composed
6382KDD ‚Äô24, August 25‚Äì29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Hao Zhou et al.
of ML predictions ùëî(ùë•ùëñ). Notably, we employ the cross-fitting tech-
nique [ 6,28] here to ensure that the proxy ÀÜùëåùëñand treatment ùëáùëñare
independent.
Linear regression stage: include the proxy ÀÜùëåùëñas a regressor in
the linear regression step. The ATE estimation is the estimate of ùëé1.
ùëåùëñ=ùëé0+ùëé1ùëáùëñ+ùëé2ÀÜùëåùëñ+ùúñùëñ (3)
for simplicity, we denote the Eq. (3)asùëåùëñ=ùëéùëáùë•ùëñ+ùúñùëñ, where
ùëé=(ùëé0,ùëé1,ùëé2)ùëá, andùë•ùëñ=(1,ùëáùëñ,ÀÜùëåùëñ)ùëá.
To capture the structure of the typical observations while deal-
ing with outliers automatically, we model the residuals using the
Student‚Äôsùë°-distribution instead of the Gaussian distribution, here.

lution of a Gaussian distribution with a Gamma distribution placed
on its precisions by introducing a latent variable ùúÇùëñ.

3.4 Computational Complexity
Compared to the CUPAC and MLRATE estimators, STATE incurs
extra computational costs, primarily due to the implementation of
the EM algorithm. Specifically, in each iteration, calculating the
posterior distribution parameters {ùúâùëñ,ùúÅùëñ}ùëõ
ùëñ=1and model parameters
ùúÉ={ùëéùëá,ùúé2,ùë£}each takesùëÇ(ùëÅ)operations. Consequently, the
overall computational complexity of EM algorithm amounts to
ùëÇ(ùêæùëÅ), whereùêædenotes the number of iterations. According to
the empirical experience on the Meituan experimental platform,
the EM procedure typically requires 30 to 60 seconds to process
500,000 observations.
4 Consistent Transformation of Ratio Metrics
The ratio metrics are also common in the industry, which can be
regarded as the ratio of two count metrics. For example, the click-
through rate is a ratio metric, which is a ratio of the click number
and the pageview number. Addressing the variance reduction of
ratio metrics is more complex but much less investigated in existing
works. In this section, we will introduce consistent transformation
so that STATE can be utilized to reduce variance of ratio metrics.
Following the notations in Sec. 2.1, let ùëåùë°,ùëåùëê,ùëçùë°,ùëçùëêbe the corre-
sponding count metrics, i.e.,
ùëåùë°=√ç
ùëáùëñ=1ùëåùëñ
ùëÅùë°,ùëåùëê=√ç
ùëáùëñ=0ùëåùëñ
ùëÅùëê,ùëçùë°=√ç
ùëáùëñ=1ùëçùëñ
ùëÅùë°,ùëçùëê=√ç
ùëáùëñ=0ùëçùëñ
ùëÅùëê.
LetùëÖùë°andùëÖùëêbe the ratio metrics of the treatment group and the
control group respectively, i.e.,
ùëÖùë°=√ç
ùëáùëñ=1ùëåùëñ√ç
ùëáùëñ=1ùëçùëñ=ùëåùë°
ùëçùë°, ùëÖùëê=√ç
ùëáùëñ=0ùëåùëñ√ç
ùëáùëñ=0ùëçùëñ=ùëåùëê
ùëçùëê.According to the delta method [ 7], the variance of ratio metrics can
be approximately computed by
ùê∑ùëÖùë°=1
[ùê∏ùëçùë°]2ùê∑ùëåùë°+[ùê∏ùëåùë°]2

=ùê∑[ùëåùë°‚àíùõºùë°ùëçùë°]
[ùê∏ùëçùë°]2,
whereùõºùë°=ùê∏ùëåùë°/ùê∏ùëçùë°. Therefore, we have
ùê∑[ŒîùëÖ]=ùê∑[ùëÖùë°‚àíùëÖùëê]
=ùê∑ùëÖùë°+ùê∑ùëÖùëê
=ùê∑[ùëåùë°‚àíùõºùë°ùëçùë°]
[ùê∏ùëçùë°]2+ùê∑[ùëåùëê‚àíùõºùëêùëçùëê]
[ùê∏ùëçùëê]2,
whereùõºùëê=ùê∏ùëåùëê/ùê∏ùëçùëêand the second equality holds due to ùëÖùë°‚ä•ùëÖùëê.
Since the analysis unit in ratio metrics does not match the ran-
domization unit, the common regression-adjusted method and ro-
bust estimation cannot directly perform variance reduction for ratio
metrics [ 15]. The work [ 4] transformed ratio metrics ùëÖùë°=ùëåùë°/ùëçùë°
to linear metrics ùêøùë°=ùëåùë°‚àíùúÖùëçùë°, whereùúÖ=(1‚àíùúÇ)ùëÖùë°+ùúÇùëÖùëê. After
such linear transformation, regression adjustment can be applied
for variance reduction of Œîùêø=ùêøùë°‚àíùêøùëê, and the significance level of
ŒîùëÖcan be obtained by performing student t test for Œîùêø. However,
there are two crucial defects in this work. Firstly, it is showed that
Œîùêø=((1‚àíùúÇ)ùëçùëê+ùúÇùëçùë°)ŒîùëÖ. The coefficient(1‚àíùúÇ)ùëçùëê+ùúÇùëçùë°is not
a constant and thus the significance level of Œîùêøis not equivalent
to that of ŒîùëÖ. Secondly, the analysis for the variance of Œîùêøin this
work is based on the hypothesis where the parameter ùúÖis taken as
a constant, but it actually consists of random variables ùëÖùë°andùëÖùëê.
In this section, we follow the main idea in [ 4] (transforming
ratio metrics to linear metrics), but mitigate the above two defects
simultaneously. Specifically, we construct a new linear metric ŒîùëÉ
and let Œîùëà=ŒîùëÉ
ùê∏ùëçùë°ùê∏ùëçùëê, which preserves both unbiased estimation
and consistent variance, i.e.,
Property 1. Unbiased estimation: ùê∏[Œîùëà]=ùúèùëü,
Property 2. Consistent variance: ùê∑[Œîùëà]‚âàùê∑[ŒîùëÖ],
whereùúèùëü=ùê∏[ùëåùëñ(1)]
ùê∏[ùëçùëñ(1)]‚àíùê∏[ùëåùëñ(0)]
ùê∏[ùëçùëñ(0)]is ATE of ratio metrics. Since ùê∏ùëçùë°ùê∏ùëçùëê
is a constant, Property 1 guarantees that the significance level of
ŒîùëÉis equivalent to that of ùúèùëü. Although the value of ùê∏ùëçùë°ùê∏ùëçùëêis
unknown in practice, we can obtain the significance level of ùúèùëüby
making hypothesis testing for ŒîùëÉ. Based on Property 2, performing
regression adjustment for ŒîùëÉwill result in a consistent estimator of
Œîùëàwith smaller variance than ŒîùëÖ. Furthermore, robust estimation
can be introduced and eliminate the influence of the atypical and
outlying observations.
Construction of ŒîùëÉ.For each sample, construct the new label
asùëÉùëñ=ùúÖ1ùëåùëñ‚àíùúÖ2ùëçùëñ. Hence, we have ùëÉùë°=√ç
ùëáùëñ=1ùëÉùëñ
ùëÅùë°=ùúÖ1ùëåùë°‚àíùúÖ2ùëçùë°,

According to the delta method, the variance of Œîùëàcan be rewritten

5 Experimental Evaluation
In this section, we construct large-scale experiments to demonstrate
the effectiveness of STATE using both simulated data and real user
data from the Meituan food delivery platform. Firstly, we validate
the performance of various methods in reducing the variance of
count metrics and ratio metrics in simulation data. For complete-
ness, we also investigate the impact of the proportion of outliers in
the data set on STATE. Secondly, to show the magnitude of vari-
ance reduction that can be achieved in practice, we perform a series
of A/A tests on key metrics of interest for Meituan food delivery
business. Finally, we discuss limitations of the STATE estimator.5.1 Experimental Setup
Simulation data. The generating process is almost the same as [ 13].
Denote each sample by (ùëãùëñ,ùëáùëñ,ùëåùëñ,ùëçùëñ). The covariates ùëãùëñis dis-
tributed asùëãùëñ‚àºN(ùë¢,ùêº5√ó5), whereùë¢is generated from a uniform
distribution ùëà(0,10). The outcome variables ùëåùëñandùëçùëñare con-
structed byùëåùëñ=ùëè(ùëãùëñ)+ùëáùëñ‚àóùúèùë¶(ùëãùëñ)+ùúñùëñandùëçùëñ=ùëê(ùëãùëñ)+ùëáùëñ‚àóùúèùëß(ùëãùëñ)+ùúÇùëñ
respectively, where ùúñùëñandùúÇùëñare the error terms distributed as
ùúñùëñ‚àºN( 0,252),ùúÇùëñ‚àºN( 0,102). Letùëè(ùëãùëñ)andùëê(ùëãùëñ)be nonlinear
functions with the forms(
ùëè(ùëãùëñ)=10 sin(ùúãùëãùëñ1ùëãùëñ2)+6ùëã2
ùëñ3+10|ùëãùëñ4|+5|ùëãùëñ5|+50,
ùëê(ùëãùëñ)=10 sin(ùúãùëãùëñ4)ùëãùëñ5+15(ùëãùëñ2+ùëãùëñ3)2+5|ùëãùëñ1|+30.
The treatment effect is also given by a nonlinear form as
(
ùúèùë¶(ùëãùëñ)=ùëãùëñ1ùëãùëñ3+log(1+ùëíùëãùëñ2),
ùúèùëß(ùëãùëñ)=ùëã2
ùëñ2+3 log(1+ùëíùëãùëñ4+|ùëãùëñ5|).
Additionally, in order to validate the performance of our STATE
estimator in dealing with heavy-tailed metrics, we also add a certain
proportion of outliers to the simulation data set. The outliers are
randomly generated from two uniform distributions ùëà(ùëå+4ùúéùë¶,ùëå+
20ùúéùë¶)andùëà(ùëç+4ùúéùëß,ùëç+20ùúéùëß), whereùúéùë¶andùúéùëßare the standard
deviation of ùëåùëñandùëçùëñrespectively.
We generate 200K samples in total and perform 1000 simulation
experiments. In each simulation, we randomly choose 20K samples
and divide them equally into the treatment group and the control
group according to the treatment indicator ùëáùëñwhich follows ùëáùëñ‚àº
Bernoulli(0.5). Finally, we compare the variance of different ATE
estimators in all the simulations.
Real user data. The real user data is collected from Meituan food
delivery platform, which contains over 2.3 million samples and
58 covariates. Each sample records all the transaction information
for a user during an experiment in this platform. To show the
effectiveness of the STATE estimator, we select two count metrics,
the count of orders per user (orders in short) and GMV per user,
and a ratio metric, the average price per order (AvgOrdPrice). Here,
GMV refers to the total price paid by each user on the food delivery
platform during the trial period. The average price per order is
calculated by dividing the sum of GMV of all users by the total
number of orders of all users.
For each metric, we perform A/A tests by selecting 200k users
randomly and assigning the treatment indicator ùëáùëñ‚àºBernoulli(0.5)
for each user. Similarly, the A/A test is also repeated 1000 times.
Notice that the A/A test is a controlled experiment where treatment
is identical to control, hence the ground truth of ATE is 0.
Benchmark. For both count and ratio metrics, multiple methods for
variance reduction are implemented and taken as the benchmarks.
‚Ä¢Count metrics
‚ÄìDIM. The difference-in-mean estimator that computes
ATE by Eq. (1) for count metrics.
‚ÄìCUPED. The state-of-the-art linear method proposed in [ 9],
which reduces variance of count metrics by utilizing the
pre-experiment covariates and gives an unbiased estima-
tion of ATE.
‚ÄìCUPAC. Similar to CUPED, but replace the pre-experiment
covariates with a proxy highly correlated with the out-
come variable [23].

‚ÄìSTATE. The robust regression-adjusted estimator for ratio

Evaluation Metrics. We compare various variance reduction tech-
niques on two primary evaluation metrics: bias and variance. Con-
sistent with previous studies[ 13,15], we assess the bias by utilizing
the empirical coverage rate of the 95% confidence intervals (CI).
The closer the empirical coverage rate is to the nominal cover-
age rate(95%), the smaller the bias of the estimator. On the other
hand, for the variance metric, the smaller the value, the shorter the
confidence interval and the higher the efficiency of the estimator.
‚Ä¢Empirical coverage. The empirical coverage represents the
proportion of 1000 simulations in which the 95% confidence
interval covers the ground truth.
‚Ä¢Variance. The variance of ATE estimates across 1000 simula-
tion experiments.
5.2 Simulation Experiment
In this section, we utilize simulation experiments to validate the
effectiveness of the algorithms proposed in this paper. First of all,
Table 1, 2 and Fig. 2 show the simulation results for count metrics
and ratio metrics on the dataset with 0.5% outliers. Furthermore,
we investigate the impact of the proportion of outliers on vari-
ous variance reduction techniques. "Var.Red%" displays the vari-
ance reduction gains for each method compared to DIM estimator.
"Emp.Cov%" displays the empirical coverage of the 95% CIs.

Emp.Cov% 95.1 94.3 94.6 94.8
Var.Red% 0 6.7 55.7 90.1
5.2.1 Count Metrics.
As shown in Table 1, the empirical coverage of all count metric
estimators closely approximates the nominal coverage (95%), indi-
cating that the biases associated with these estimators are minimal.Fig. 2(a) depicts the probability density of ATE estimates, reveal-
ing that STATE‚Äôs ATE distribution is markedly more compact, with
its variance being substantially reduced compared to that of other
methods. Specifically, the CUPED method reduces the variance
by 28.7% compared to the DIM estimator; CUPAC and MLRATE
perform similarly and deliver additional gains relative to CUPED.
It indicates that the proxy variable constructed by the ML model
has a superior correlation with the outcome than a single covariate.
In contrast, the performance of the STATE estimator is remarkable,
achieving an over 80% variance reduction compared to the DIM
estimator and significantly enhancing the precision of ATE estima-
tion. Considering both the empirical coverage rate and estimator
variance, STATE clearly emerges as the preferred ATE estimator.
5.2.2 Ratio Metrics.
Fig. 2(b) and Table 2 present the detailed experimental results of
variance reduction for ratio metrics in simulation data. As is shown
by Table 2, the empirical coverage of all the estimators are close
to the nominal coverage, in which STATE achieves the best per-
formance on variance reduction. Specifically, CUPED only reduces
6.7% of variance compared to DIM duo to the weak correlation
between the pre-experiment covariates and the ratio metric. CTRM
performs much better, which achieves over 55.7% variance reduc-
tion compared with DIM. However, the effectiveness of CTRM is
also limited by the correlation between the ML-based predictors
and the outcome metrics, which is easily influenced by big outliers.
As a robust estimator, STATE can significantly decrease the neg-
ative effects for variance caused by outliers, which contributes to
over 90.1% variance reduction relative to DIM.
5.2.3 Factors Affecting STATE Effectiveness.
Now let‚Äôs look at the factors that affect the performance of STATE.
Here, we discuss the problem from a general setting to specific
settings by constructing a Gaussian distribution dataset and adding
different proportions of outliers from 0 to 1%. Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b)
display the results of empirical coverage and variance reduction
respectively.
From the Fig. 3(b), we can see that when the dataset does not
contain outliers, more precisely, the metrics follow a Gaussian distri-
bution, STATE, CUPAC, and MLRATE perform similarly in variance
reduction. As the proportion of outliers increases, STATE and base-
line methods exhibit drastically different performance. The reason
is that the degree of variance reduction of typical methods such as
CUPED, CUPAC and MLRATE depends on the correlation between
the constructed covariates or proxy variables and business metrics.

Figure 3: Impact of proportions of outliers
However, with the existence of outliers, correlation learning be-
comes increasingly difficult. The result is that the performance of
these typical techniques deteriorates gradually, degrading to the
variance scale of the DIM method. The STATE estimator we pro-
posed is designed to address such challenges by modeling the noise
as a Student‚Äôs ùë°-distribution. Because of the excellent robustness
of the T estimate, the rate of variance increase of STATE is signifi-
cantly slower than the DIM method with the increase of outliers.
Consequently, the more pronounced the heavy tail phenomenon of
business metrics, the more apparent the advantage of the STATE
method in variance reduction.
5.3 Empirical Results
In this section, we perform two real experiments on the Meituan
food delivery platform, analyzing the count metrics and ratio met-
rics, respectively. Here, we focus on the A/A tests, not the A/B
tests running in production. This is because the true effect of the
A/B tests is unknown, which makes it impossible to evaluate theempirical coverage rate of the confidence interval. Since the aver-
age treatment effect (ATE) in online experiments is typically small
and unlikely to significantly change the relationship between the
outcomes and covariates, the reduction in variance in A/B tests
should be very similar to that in A/A tests.

5.3.1 Count metrics.
On the food delivery platform, business metrics with a heavy-
tailed distribution are quiet common. This is typically caused by

users‚Äô accidental consumption behavior. For example, a user orders
takeaway to treat friends to dinner, the consumption price of her
order may be a extremely large value relative to her historical
consumption pattern. These sample points that fall on the tail (also
known as outliers) are not affected by treatment, but has great
impact on the sensitivity of measuring ATE.
To get a better sense of the magnitudes of variance reduction
that the STATE method might achieve in practice, we select two
key count metrics: orders per user and GMV per user, both of which
have heavy-tail distributions. For each metric, we construct A/A
tests. Table 3 and Fig. 4 show the empirical results. It indicates
that the STATE performs substantially better than the CUPED,
CUPAC and MLRATE estimators on both orders metric and GMV
metric. On average, the STATE estimator reduces the variance of
the order metric and GMV metric by 70.5% and 80.7% respectively
compared to the DIM method, whereas the analogous figures for the
state-of-the-art methods are about 54.6% and 44.4%. It demonstrates
that STATE can indeed considerably improve the sensitivity of
real business metrics, which is of great significance for increasing
business profits and reducing the cost of experimental time.
Furthermore, we compare STATE method with the typical win-
sorization [ 11] method and Huber regression [ 5] for dealing with
heavy-tailed metrics. Table 4 and 5 display the results of Winsoriza-
tion at different thresholds(99% and 99.9% quantiles of the observa-
tions). It is observed that estimation is sensitive to the threshold.
A lower threshold results in more observations beyond threshold
being restrained, which consequently yields a reduced variance in
parameter estimation. However, there is a concomitant decline in
the empirical coverage rate, suggesting an incremental increase in
bias. Consequently, employing the Winsorization process necessi-
tates a meticulous balance between the impact of bias and variance.
As shown in Table 3 and 4, the variance of the parameters estimated
by the Huber regression method is slightly smaller than that of
the CUPAC and MLRATE methods (without winsorization). This is
because Huber regression transforms the mean square loss function
of extreme observations into a linear form, thereby partially reduc-
ing the impact of outliers. However, the results also show that the
robustness of the Huber regression method is limited, exhibiting a
considerable disparity when compared to the STATE method.
5.3.2 Ratio metrics.
Fig. 4(c) and Table 6 present the results for ratio metric named
AvgOrdPrice in real user data, which is calculated by dividing the
sum of GMV of all users by the total number of orders. As is shown
by Table 6, the empirical coverage of all the estimators converges
to 95%, and STATE still performs the best because of the strong
capacity of resisting disturbance for outliers that exactly exists in
real data. In summary, the variance reduction of STATE is about91.6% relative to DIM, relative to CUPED is 91.0%, relative to CTRM
is 89.3%.
5.4 Limitations
In the preceding discussions, STATE has achieved notable success
in the application of variance reduction for both count metrics
and ratio metrics. Now let‚Äôs discuss the applicability of the STATE
method. Inspired by section 5.2.3, we find the effectiveness of the
STATE method varies from metric to metric, depending on whether
the distribution of the metric has a heavy tail. When metric follows
a Gaussian distribution, the STATE method is comparable with the
state-of-the-art methods, but introduces extra computational cost.
If the metric exhibits a heavy tail distribution, the STATE method
demonstrates a strong advantage.
6 Conclusion
Variance reduction is the common technology to improve the sensi-
tivity in online controlled experiments, which contributes to smaller
user population and shorter experimental period. However, typical
methods cannot characterize the heavy-tailed distributions in real
business metrics, whose efficiency is greatly limited by the outlying
observations. In this paper, we proposed a machine-learning-based
regression adjustment method with Student‚Äôs ùë°-distributed errors
to reduce the impact of outliers in variance reduction for count
metrics. Furthermore, we transform ratio metrics into a linear com-
bination but preserve unbiased estimation and consistent variance,
and apply the above method to the variance reduction of ratio
metrics. Both synthetic and real data demonstrate a significant
decrease in variance for both count and ratio metrics compared
to state-of-the-art methods. It benefits from our robust estimator
that is stronger to resist disturbance of outliers. We recommend to
use the method especially in the experiments where the treatment
effect is not very significant. In this case, the influence of outliers
is relative larger but can be effectively mitigated by our method.
As the method significantly improves the robustness of con-
trolled experiment results, we would like to expand it to the esti-
mation of individual treatment effects (ITE) in future works, which
also suffers from the negative effects of outliers.
