ABSTRACT
Nowadays, while most machine learning research on customer
journey optimization has focused on short-term success metrics
such as click-through rates and optimal ad placement, there has
been little consideration given to developing a coherent system for
end-to-end customer journey optimization. Such a system would
encompass all aspects of the customer experience, from presenting
the right product value to the right users, to understanding a user’s
likelihood of conversion and long-term value to the platform, as well
as their propensity for cross-selling and risk of churning. Currently,
models and algorithms for customer journey optimization are often
developed in isolation, leading to inefficiencies in modeling and data
pipelines. Furthermore, the customer is often viewed as a collection
of different entities by different organizational departments (such as
marketing, sales, and finance), which can lead to additional friction
in the customer experience. This workshop seeks to bridge the gap
between academic researchers and industrial practitioners who are
interested in building holistic solutions for end-to-end customer
journey optimization. In addition, with the rising popularity of
generative AI and LLM, we want to use this venue to exchange ideas
regarding their applications in different stages of customer journey,
and how the new technologies could help businesses achieve their
KPIs.

1 INTRODUCTION
For the holistic/long term success of a customer on a platform -
the key is to understand the levers that can help make customers
more successful on the platform in the long term by estimating
customers’ growth and retention patterns, lifetime value, interest
to buy new products, propensity to churn, etc. Also, it is critical
to not only predict success/propensities/lifetime but also be able
to take the customer to a more successful path on the platform.
Throughout the user journey and life cycle, there are interesting
opportunities for customer optimization.
•Broad Audience Brand and Product Awareness:
–What is the best channel to invest for brand awareness?
–What are long-term effects of brand tactics?
–What value does brand and product awareness bring to
the platform?
•First is new user Acquisition:
–Which user group is worth targeting via marketing and
directing to purchase flow?
–Which ads creative and serving channel would generate
the most likely conversions and customer value across
multiple products?
–How do we optimize bidding strategy to maximize scale
at an efficiency guard-rail such as LTV/CAC? How to
optimize bidding strategy to maximize profitability?
•New User Onboarding:
–How do we leverage LLM to personalize the onboarding
experience in a cost effective manner?
–How do we make the onboarding flow as smooth as possi-
ble?
–How do we identify and fix new user pain points?
–How do we leverage messages and paid levers such as pro-
motions intelligently to move users through the funnel?
•Mature User Experience:

–How do we provide the best product experience to users -
product design, recommendation algorithm, search algo-
rithm, pricing strategy, incentives, segmentation?
–What’s the best way to communicate with our customers?
How to send emails / push notifications to the right audi-
ence at the right time with a proper frequency?
•Churn Prevention and Win-back:
–How do we prevent user churn?
–How do we downsell or cross sell to prevent churn?
–How do we win back churned users?
The goal of the workshop is to provide a forum for industrial
practitioners to share practical experiences and real-world chal-
lenges, while academic researchers can popularize state-of-art re-
search. Collaborative discussions and knowledge sharing between
academia and industry need be fostered. Although machine learning
approaches have been widely experimented and adopted across or-
ganizations to solve various independent problems, time has come
to look at these optimizations holistically, remove redundancies
and put the customer in the front and center. With this goal, We
invite submissions of papers describing ML and data science solu-
tions for customer journey optimization. These include solutions
in the space of sales, marketing, go-to-market, monetization data
science, with emphasis on building holistic solutions for new user
acquisition and onboarding, user retention and long term success,
churn prevention, upsell, cross-sell, pricing optimization, to name
a few. From a machine learning/AI perspective, this translates into
interesting problems in the area of
•Semi-supervised and multi-task learning frameworks/algorithms
to handle complex prediction and optimization scenarios.
•Deep learning networks to model end-end customer life
cycle.
•Embeddings and representation learning for customers and
their related entities.
•Reinforcement learning to iteratively optimize personalized
policies for maximizing user experience.
•MAB to select the optimal design and content dynamically
through explore-and-exploit.
•Propensity scoring to target the customers who are ready to
buy from you.
•Uplift modeling to predict the effect of intervention on user
behavior.
•LTV prediction to get a measurement of customers who are
more likely to be successful.
•Causal inference: Understand LTV changing events
•Churn prediction to predict which users are likely to churn
and design interventions accordingly
