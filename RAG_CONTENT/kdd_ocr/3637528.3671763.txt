Abstract
Anoutstanding fact (OF) is a striking claim by which some entities
stand out from their peers on some attribute. OFs serve data journal-
ism, fact checking, and recommendation. However, one could jump
to conclusions by selecting truthful OFs while intentionally or inad-
vertently ignoring lateral contexts and data that render them less
striking. This jumping conclusion bias from unstable OFs may dis-
orient the public, including voters and consumers, raising concerns
about fairness and transparency in political and business compe-
tition. It is thus ethically imperative for several stakeholders to
measure the robustness of OFs with respect to lateral contexts and
data. Unfortunately, a capacity for such inspection of OFs mined
from knowledge graphs (KGs) is missing. In this paper, we propose
a methodology that inspects the robustness of OFs in KGs by per-
turbation analysis. We define (1) entity perturbation, which detects
outlying contexts by perturbing context entities in the OF; and
(2) data perturbation, which considers plausible data that render
an OF less striking. We compute the expected strikingness scores of
OFs over perturbation relevance distributions and assess an OF as ro-
bust if its measured strikingness does not deviate significantly from
the expected. We devise a suite of exact and sampling algorithms for
perturbation analysis on large KGs. Extensive experiments reveal
that our methodology accurately and efficiently detects frail OFs
generated by existing mining approaches on KGs. We also show
the effectiveness of our approaches through case and user studies.

1 Introduction
The discovery of outstanding facts (OFs) is central to a wide range
of application domains, including data journalism [ 8,11,25], fact
checking [ 2,20–24], and recommendation [ 31,55,58,59]. An OF
is a striking statement that an attribute of one or a few entities
stands out among their peer entities. For instance, the news media
often use OFs as leads to draft news stories and attract audiences:
“Kamala Harris is the first woman to hold the position of Vice President
of the United States” [39]. This statement reveals an OF regarding
gender (attribute ) over all politicians (peer entities ) who have held
the position of US vice president. Manual discovery of OFs can be
tedious and time-consuming, requiring extensive human effort to
sift through vast amounts of data. As such, there have been many
studies on automatic OF mining [5, 10, 27, 50, 55, 58].
Despite the traction of OFs in engaging with a diversity of au-
diences, from journalists in the first place to citizens as voters or
consumers, their striking and captivating nature also entails the
risk that they may induce misinformation by misleading people
tojump to conclusions [28], i.e., crafting rushed interpretations
and making biased decisions [ 2,30,52]. For example, in sales cam-
paigns, rare product attributes may be framed as OFs by strategi-
cally placing products in specific contexts, potentially misinforming
customers [ 12]. Such OF-induced misinformation may violate legis-
lation; in the UK, for instance, it is classified as misleading action and
omission, a trading practice that violates the Consumer Protection
from Unfair Trading Regulations (CPRs) [ 36]. Likewise, advances
in data journalism come with the perils of misinformation; whilst
media scholars have long shown the power of media in shaping
public opinion [ 9], legal scholars have been debating the legal im-
plications of disinformation as a fundamental rights violation [ 43].
To address the perils of OF-induced misinformation in particular,
prior studies conduct perturbation analysis , i.e., assess OFs using
a context-aware robustness measure while perturbing numerical
parameters [ 52], group-by attributes [ 30], and time intervals [ 2] in

the query that defines the OF context. However, existing robustness
measures and perturbation analysis methods overlook two types
of hasty generalizations: (1) context entity generalization and (2)
limited data generalization.
Context Entity Generalization. The cause of gender parity in
academia engenders extensive and controversial discourse within on-
line communities and academic circles [ 32,35]. To seize public atten-
tion, one may generate eye-catching OFs using existing OF discovery
methods [ 55,58]: for instance, the American Council on Education
(ACE), a prominent US higher education association, boasts a diverse
membership comprising numerous accredited colleges and univer-
sities. Notably, among the individuals employed by ACE member
institutions, the male demographic constitutes 31%.
This fact might mislead the public to generalize about a perceived
disparity of male faculty members in US universities. However,
considering other associations, such as the American Association
of State Colleges and Universities, the male percentage rises to 50%.
In fact, the aggregate male percentage among US academics is 66%.
We conclude that ACE is an untypical context entity that deliberately
or inadvertently provokes generalizations about the gender gap.
Limited Data Generalization. Seed investing in startups generates
returns from the capital market once a company is publicly listed.
Reddit, a US social media site, has filed for its initial public offering
(IPO) [ 14]. An OF generated by [ 55,58] on Wikidata yields Uber as
theonly success case of an IPO backed by Reddit’s investors.
The noted OF regarding Reddit’s investors could undermine
confidence in Reddit’s IPO due to an apparent lack of investor ex-
perience in IPO cases. However, start-up enterprises often progress
through multiple funding rounds, rendering such a generalization
dubious, as Reddit has the potential to attract more investors in the
future. Remarkably, Sequoia Capital invested in Reddit during its
2017 Series C funding round [ 6], a fact undocumented in Wikidata
at the time of writing, and has also invested in several publicly
traded companies, including Apple, Airbnb, and Nvidia.
Perturbation Analysis of OFs. To mitigate such potential rami-
fications, we propose a novel perturbation analysis methodology
that evaluates OF robustness. We focus on OFs mined from knowl-
edge graphs (KGs) [ 45,47,55,58], as there is currently no method
to assess their robustness, while the richness of facts available in
large KGs, such as DBpedia [ 29], Freebase [ 4], and Wikidata [ 44],
allows semantically relevant perturbations to curb both context
entity and limited data generalizations. We define (1) entity pertur-
bation, which evaluates the strikingness of an OF by substituting
the context entity with a similar entity from the KG (e.g., replacing
“ACE” with a similar association), and (2) data perturbation, which
introduces a plausible edge into the KG to evaluate the continued
validity of the OF claim (e.g., including another investor, Sequoia
Capital, to Reddit).
Moreover, we calculate an OF’s expected strikingness over a
perturbation relevance distribution (PRD) that assigns weights to(entity or data) perturbations by their relevance to the OF. An OF
whose strikingness is significantly higher than the expected value
derived from the respective PRD is less robust than others and
should be inspected by domain experts. Our methodology can be
seamlessly integrated into the overall OF mining process, as the
dashed-box component in Figure 1 illustrates. Using our method-
ology, stakeholders such as data journalists, fact-checkers, civil
society organizations, and other interested parties can cross-check,
evaluate, and verify the robustness of OFs on which they intend to
base decisions. We summarize our main contributions as follows:
•We formalize the perturbation analysis of OFs from KGs by entity
and data perturbation. To our best knowledge, this is the first
attempt to measure the robustness of OFs extracted from KGs.
•We devise efficient exact algorithms for entity and data perturba-
tion analysis. We further propose sampling-based approximation
algorithms that scale to large perturbation spaces.
•We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approaches.
The results demonstrate that our analysis discovers frail OFs
generated by existing OF mining approaches [ 55]. Furthermore,
our approximation algorithms complete the perturbation analysis
within five minutes for over 90%of OFs, with a mean estimation
error around 2.7%and 1.3%for entity and data perturbation,
respectively. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our system
with a crowdsourced user study.
2 Background
A knowledge graph (KG) is denoted as G(V,E,L), whereVandE
represent the sets of node and edge instances, respectively. An
edge instance 𝑒∈E connects two node instances 𝑢,𝑣∈V. The
functionLmaps each node or edge instance 𝑣or𝑒to its typeL(𝑣)
orL(𝑒). We define a node variable ˜𝑣∈{𝑣,L(𝑣)}to be either a
node instance 𝑣or a node typeL(𝑣).N(𝑣,L(𝑒))andN(𝑉,L(𝑒))
represent the neighbors of node 𝑣and node set 𝑉via edge typeL(𝑒),
respectively.N(𝑣)andN(𝑉)are the neighbors of node 𝑣and node
set𝑉without the edge type constraint. For ease of presentation,
we simply useG(V,E)orGto refer to the KG.
We study OFs discovered by path queries, as path queries can be
easily and intuitively translated into natural language claims [ 55].
Nonetheless, our perturbation analysis can be extended to support
general KG queries. Formally, we define path queries as follows:
Definition 2.1 (Path Query). A path query is a sequence of node
variables and edge types. We use 𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝐸0,˜𝑣1,..., ˜𝑣𝑘−1,𝐸𝑘−1,˜𝑣𝑘), or
simply𝑃(˜𝑣0,˜𝑣𝑘), to denote a 𝑘-hop path query, where 𝐸𝑖is the edge
type of the𝑖thedge and𝑖∈{0,...,𝑘−1}.𝐸−1
𝑖represents the syntactic
reverse edge type of 𝐸𝑖, i.e., for an edge 𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣)whereL(𝑒)=𝐸𝑖,
we denote byL(𝑒′)=𝐸−1
𝑖the type of its reverse edge 𝑒′=(𝑣,𝑢).
Definition 2.2 (Matching Instance). Amatching instance to a path
query𝑃(˜𝑣0,˜𝑣𝑘)is a sequence of node and edge instances in G
denoted by𝑝(𝑣0,𝑒0,𝑣1,...,𝑣𝑘−1,𝑒𝑘−1,𝑣𝑘)or𝑝(𝑣0,𝑣𝑘)satisfying:
•∀𝑖∈{0,...,𝑘},L(𝑣𝑖)=˜𝑣𝑖, where ˜𝑣𝑖is a node typeL(𝑣);
•∀𝑖∈{0,...,𝑘},𝑣𝑖=˜𝑣𝑖, where ˜𝑣𝑖is a node instance 𝑣; and
•∀𝑖∈{0,...,𝑘−1},𝑒𝑖=(𝑣𝑖,𝑣𝑖+1)∈E andL(𝑒𝑖)=𝐸𝑖.
We use𝑝⊲𝑃to represent that path 𝑝is a matching instance of
path query𝑃. For each node variable ˜𝑣𝑖in path query 𝑃, we denote

correspond to ˜𝑣𝑖in𝑃) as𝑉𝑖⊆V for all𝑖∈{0,...,𝑘}.
Most existing studies [ 55,58] discover attribute-value pairs (e.g.,
Gender-Female ) in OFs by defining peer entities. To generate diver-
sified OFs, e.g., news stories in different contexts, they acquire peer
entities from context path queries by specifying a node constraint
as context information. Formally:
Definition 2.3 (Peer Entities). Given a target attributeAand a
path query𝑃(˜𝑣0,˜𝑣𝑘=𝑐)where𝑐is acontext entity, an instance 𝑣0
is apeer entity of𝑐under𝑃andAif∃𝑝(𝑣0,𝑐)⊲𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐)and𝑣0has
the target attribute A. We denote by 𝑉0the set of peer entities of 𝑐
under a path query 𝑃and attributeA.
Example 2.4. Consider the path query in Figure 2 and the target
attribute Gender. The query 𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝐸0,˜𝑣1,𝐸1,‘American Council on
Education’)uses the ACE as a context entity for OF discovery,
where𝐸0=‘Employee Of’ and𝐸1=‘Member Of’ . Under query 𝑃,
set𝑉1contains all universities with ACE membership, while the
set of peer entities 𝑉0includes all people who have worked with at
least one of these universities and have the Gender attribute.
Definition 2.5 (Candidate OF). A candidate OF is a triplet 𝑄=
(A,X,𝑃), whereA,Xand𝑃denote the following:
•X is avalue in the domain of attributeA; and
•𝑃is a path query 𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐)that implicitly defines peer entities
of the context entity 𝑐under attributeA.
The valueXin a candidate OF is considered striking if it stands
out among the values of the same attribute Ain the peer entity set
defined by𝑃. Specifically, we adopt the OF strikingness measure, i.e.,
the measure used by existing OF discovery approaches [ 51,55,58]
to rank the candidate OFs and identify the most striking ones.
Definition 2.6 (Strikingness Measure). Given a candidate OF 𝑄=
(A,X,𝑃),𝐹(A,X,𝑉0)denotes the frequency of valueXfor at-
tributeAamong peer entities in 𝑉0. The strikingness of 𝑄is:
I(𝑄)=∑︁
X′∈X𝐹(A,X′,𝑉0),
whereX={X′|𝐹(A,X′,𝑉0)>𝐹(A,X,𝑉0)}, i.e., the set of val-
ues𝑋′whose frequency for attribute Ais higher than that of X
among the peer entities. Note that if X=∅, theI(𝑄)=0.
Example 2.7. Figure 2 presents a candidate OF regarding the gen-
der gap among US university employees. As detailed in Example 2.4,
the peer entity set 𝑉0includes all people who have the attribute

Gender and have worked with an ACE member. The frequency of
appearance of the attribute-value pair Gender-Male in𝑉0is 0.31.
Given that the sum of frequencies for Gender values higher than
that of Male (i.e., in this case, for value Female ) is 0.69, by Defi-
nition 2.6, the OF’s strikingness score for the attribute-value pair
Gender-Male is 0.69. In simple terms, there are fewer male employees
among ACE universities, with a strikingness of 0.69.
We emphasize that OF discovery is independent of the challenge
we address in this paper. Our task is rather to help assess whether
a given OF is robust, as the workflow in Figure 1 depicts.
3 Perturbation Model
In this section, we first introduce the two perturbation types we
examine and define their respective perturbation spaces. Then, we
formalize the perturbation relevance distribution in these perturba-
tion spaces, which we use to assess the robustness of OFs.
3.1 Perturbation Space
We introduce two types of perturbation: entity perturbation and
data perturbation. An entity perturbation assesses the robustness
of an OF-generating query by changing its context entity. Formally,
Definition 3.1 (Entity Perturbation Space). Anentity perturba-
tion𝑄′of an OF𝑄=(A,X,𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐))replaces the context entity
path constraint 𝑐with another entity 𝑐′∈V such that:
•∃𝑝(𝑣0,𝑐′)⊲𝑃′=𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐′); and
•𝑣0has the same value Xon attributeAas the OF𝑄.
We denote the perturbed OF by 𝑄′=(A,X,𝑃′). The entity pertur-
bation space of𝑄is denoted asQand contains all possible substitute
OFs𝑄′for𝑄with different context entities 𝑐′.
Intuitively, a valid entity perturbation changes the context entity
path constraint 𝑐to𝑐′such that the perturbed peer entities still
contain the attribute-value pair (A,X)of the original OF.
Example 3.2. Figure 3 shows two examples of entity pertur-
bation for the OF in Figure 2. When we replace the context en-
tity ‘American Council on Education’ in the original OF with the
‘American Association of State Colleges and Universities’ (AASCU),
the matching instances for the resulting path query differ signifi-
cantly. The peer entity set now includes faculty members in other
universities, e.g., the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh, bringing
the strikingness of the Gender-Male pair down to 0.506 (from 0.69
in the original OF). The Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU),
a consortium of US universities, is another possible entity pertur-
bation. With ORAU as the context entity, the strikingness of “male
employees” drops even lower, to 0, since no other Gender value has
higher frequency than Male in the respective 𝑉0.

Figure 4: An example of data perturbation.
A data perturbation adds a plausible edge to the KG that may
render an OF less striking. While many plausible edges may be
added to the KG, most would not affect the OF at hand. We only
consider admissible data perturbations, i.e., edges whose addition
results in a different peer entity set for path query 𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐):
Definition 3.3 (Data Perturbation Space). Anadmissible data per-
turbation𝑄′of an OF𝑄=(A,X,𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐))adds an edge 𝑒′=(𝑢,𝑣)
to the KGGsuch that𝑉′
0≠𝑉0, where𝑉′
0is the new peer entity set
of the original path query 𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐)after adding 𝑒′toG.
For a perturbation to be admissible, the node variable corre-
sponding to 𝑢in the path query 𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐)should be a node type.
Example 3.4. Figure 4 illustrates two admissible data perturba-
tions under the Reddit OF mentioned in Section 1. The first adds a
plausible edge 𝑒=(‘Pinduoduo’ ,‘Tencent’) for𝐸0. Consequently,
Pinduoduo is added to the peer entity set 𝑉0, rendering the Is_listed-
True pair less striking in the updated 𝑉0since Pinduoduo has already
been publicly listed on NASDAQ in July 2018. Another plausible
edge𝑒′=(‘Y Combinator’ ,‘Reddit’) is also an admissible pertur-
bation, for𝐸1this time. Recovering 𝑒′reveals more publicly listed
companies invested by Y Combinator, including Airbnb, CoinBase,
Twillo, PagerDuty, and Rackspace Technology.
3.2 Perturbation Relevance Distribution
Naturally, some perturbations are more relevant to an OF than
others. For instance, if one values the attributes of the association,
ORAU presents a compelling alternative to ACE in Example 2.4
since both associations welcome non-state-supported universities.
Conversely, if one values members’ constitution, AASCU emerges
as a convincing substitute since Montclair State University (under
ACE) is also affiliated with AASCU. Similarly, among the data pertur-
bations(‘Pinduoduo’ ,‘Tencent’) and(‘Y Combinator’ ,‘Reddit’) in
Example 3.4, the perturbation more relevant to the Reddit OF in
the KG would be more convincing. To formalize the relevance of
entity and data perturbations, we introduce relevance distributions.
Entity Perturbation Relevance. For a relevant entity perturba-
tion, the context entity 𝑐′in the perturbed OF 𝑄′should be semanti-
cally relevant to the context entity 𝑐in the original OF 𝑄. Given an
OF𝑄produced by path query 𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐), we model the relevance of an
entity perturbation 𝑄′∈Qfrom𝑐to𝑐′as the node similarity score
between𝑐and𝑐′. The choice of similarity function is orthogonal
to our method and any measure applicable to KGs [ 33,38] can be
used. Here, we opt for the Jaccard distance S(𝑐,𝑐′)between the
neighbor sets of 𝑐and𝑐′, that is, betweenN(𝑐)andN(𝑐′).Data Perturbation Relevance. For a data perturbation to be rele-
vant to an OF 𝑄, the added edges should be (i ) semantically related
to𝑄and (ii ) plausibly existing now or in the near future.
To address both desiderata, we propose an efficiently computed
function, head-tail relevance. Conceptually, head relevance measures
the semantic relevance of an added edge 𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣)to OF𝑄through
the similarity of 𝑒to edges in the matching path instances of 𝑄,
in particular, the similarity of 𝑢to the neighbors of 𝑣that appear
in the matching node set 𝑉of the node type of 𝑢. Nevertheless,
head relevance alone may spawn relevant yet implausible edges. To
account for the plausibility of edge 𝑒, we augment the function with
tail relevance, which measures the similarity between 𝑢’s neighbors
of type𝐸and the tail node 𝑣.
Given an admissible data perturbation 𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣)for edge type 𝐸
of OF𝑄, we formally define the head-tail relevance as:
S(𝑒)= ∑︁
𝑢′∈N(𝑣,𝐸−1)∩𝑉S(𝑢,𝑢′)!
|                           {z                           }
head relevance ∑︁
𝑣′∈N(𝑢,𝐸)S(𝑣,𝑣′)!
|                    {z                    }
tail relevance
To accommodate space constraints, we present an example that
illustrates the rationale by which we define the head-tail relevance
in Appendix A.
Discussion. Existing link prediction methods can suggest plausible
edges in a KG [ 3,7,53,56]; such methods may provide orthogonal
validation to strengthen the perturbations identified by our methods.
However, these methods aim to predict any edge in a graph as an
end in itself; contrariwise, we are interested in suggesting plausible
edges with respect to an OF 𝑄for the larger objective of building a
distribution over them, as we explain next.
Based on the above concepts, we now formally define the per-
turbation relevance distribution (PRD) for an OF 𝑄:
Definition 3.5 (Perturbation Relevance Distribution (PRD)). Given
an OF𝑄, we denote asD(𝑄)the PRD for entity/data perturbation.
The probability mass function of D(𝑄)is proportional to the cor-
responding perturbation relevance function, i.e., PD(·)∝S(𝑐,𝑐′)
for entity perturbation and PD(·)∝S(𝑒)for data perturbation.
Deviation Measure. Intuitively, an OF is not robust if many highly
relevant perturbations thereof have substantially smaller striking-
ness scores. In effect, we may compute the mean scores under both
PRDs of entity and data perturbations, and if the strikingness score
of an OF𝑄substantially deviates from the means, we regard 𝑄as
a less robust claim. We thus define the deviation measure of𝑄as:
Δ(𝑄)=E𝑄′∼D[I(𝑄)−I(𝑄′)]
E𝑄′∼D[I(𝑄′)](1)
for a PRDDdefined on𝑄, in a manner resembling robustness
scores used in other contexts [ 30]. In addition, as a counterar-
gument to OF𝑄, we return the perturbation 𝑄′that maximizes
(𝐼(𝑄)−𝐼(𝑄′))·PD(𝑄′).I(𝑄)−I(𝑄′)measures the extent to
which a perturbation 𝑄′deviates from the original fact in terms of
strikingness, while the weight for each perturbation is determined
by the PRDD.
Before presenting our algorithms for perturbation analysis, we
summarize the frequently used notation in Table 1.

Exact Algorithm. Given an OF 𝑄(A,X,𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐)), the exact entity
perturbation algorithm runs in two stages to produce the deviation
measure for 𝑄, as outlined in Algorithm 1.
ForwardPass (Lines 1–3): At this stage, we aim to find the perturba-
tion spaceQfor the given OF. Recall that Qis the set of all feasible
substitutes of the context entity 𝑐in the given query 𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐)of
length𝑘. We replace the original context entity 𝑐with a node vari-
able ˜𝑣𝑘. Then, according to Definition 3.1, we utilize the attribute-
value pair(A,X)in the given OF 𝑄to retrieve the nodes ˜𝑣0that
match the query 𝑃(˜𝑣0,˜𝑣𝑘)and form a candidate set 𝐶0with them.
Thereafter, at each level 𝑖, we find all neighbors of nodes in set 𝐶𝑖−1
via edge type 𝐸𝑖−1to form set 𝑉𝑖. The set𝐶𝑘we eventually de-
rive at level 𝑘constitutes the perturbation space Q. We call this
stage “ForwardPass” as it is performed progressively from level 0
to level𝑘.
BackwardPass (Lines 4–15): To evaluate the deviation measure of
the given OF 𝑄, we need to enumerate all nodes in the perturbation
spaceQ=𝐶𝑘. For each alternative 𝑐′∈𝐶𝑘, we replace the context
entity𝑐in the given query 𝑃by𝑐′and represent the perturbed
query as𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐′). Then, starting from 𝑐′, we find the peer entity
set𝑉′
0for𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐′)by performing the reverse operation of For-
wardPass from 𝑐′to˜𝑣0. Hence, this stage is called “BackwardPass”.
Thereafter, we calculate the strikingness score I(𝑄′)for each per-
turbed OF𝑄′and the associated relevance 𝑆(𝑐,𝑐′). The expectedstrikingness score under the entity PRD is the normalized weighted
sum ofI(𝑄′)following(𝑐,𝑐′)in the spaceQ.
The time complexity of the ForwardPass stage is upper bounded
by𝑂(Í
𝑖|𝐸𝑖|), where|𝐸𝑖|is the number of edges of type 𝐸𝑖in the
path query. Thus, the complexity of the exact algorithm is domi-
nated by the BackwardPass stage, i.e., upper bounded by 𝑂(|Q|·Í
𝑖|𝐸𝑖|·𝐽), where|Q|is the size of the entity perturbation space
and𝐽is the average time to evaluate S(𝑐,𝑐′). In practice, the cost
of𝐽is low using efficient set intersections between the neighbor
lists of𝑐and𝑐′.
Sampling-based Approximation. The exact algorithm enumer-
ates all possible entity perturbations to compute E𝑄′∼D. This enu-
meration is expensive, especially when the entity perturbation
spaceQis large. Therefore, we propose a sampling strategy to get
the point estimation ˆE𝑄′∼D. Given an OF (A,X,𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐)), we use
the same ForwardPass process as the exact algorithm to obtain the
perturbation space. We then sample a node 𝑐′as the perturbation
according to the relevance distribution PD. For each sample, we
evaluate the strikingness of the associated OF. The mean of 𝑛sam-
ples is a point estimator ˆE𝑄′∼D. The confidence interval (CI) for the
point estimate is defined as [ˆE𝑄′∼D−𝜖,ˆE𝑄′∼D+𝜖]. Since all sam-
ples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with finite
variance, the half width 𝜖is𝑂(√︁
𝜎2/𝑛)by the Central Limit Theo-
rem, where 𝜎2is the population variance. Further, E𝑄′∼D∈[0,1]
sinceI(𝑄)∈[ 0,1], hence the upper bound for the population vari-
ance𝜎2is1/4. In effect, the half width 𝜖is bounded by the sample
size𝑛. Thus,𝜖converges at a rate of 𝑂(1/√𝑛)with increasing 𝑛.
5 Data Perturbation Algorithms
A simple strategy for data perturbation is to consider any pos-
sible combination 𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣)∉Eand check whether it satisfies
Definition 3.3. However, since this strategy treats both 𝑢and𝑣as
free variables, the search space can be prohibitively large on real-
world KGs with millions of nodes. Thus, we first propose methods
to effectively prune the search space. Then, we develop efficient
exact and sampling algorithms based on the pruned search space.
Admissibility-based Reduction. By Definition 3.3, the peer en-
tity set𝑉′
0resulting from an admissible data perturbation should
be different from the original peer entity set 𝑉0. Therefore, each
admissible data perturbation should add at least onenew peer en-
tity to𝑉0. It follows that an edge 𝑒′=(𝑢,𝑣)for an admissible data
perturbation should have a node 𝑢that partially matches the path
query associated with the OF. We define the notion of a partial
matching node as follows:
Definition 5.1 (Partial Matching Node). Given an OF 𝑄=(A,X,
𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐)), a node𝑢is apartial match at level𝑖∈{0,...,𝑘−1}if:
•𝑢∉𝑉𝑖and∃𝑝(𝑣0,...,𝑢)⊲𝑃′=𝑃(˜𝑣0,˜𝑣𝑖); and
•𝑣0∉𝑉0, where𝑣0has attributeA.
Here,𝑃′is a part of𝑃from level 0to level𝑖. We denote the set of
partial matching nodes at level 𝑖as𝑉𝑖.
Lemma 5.2. An edge𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣)is an admissible data perturbation
for edge type 𝐸𝑖of an OF𝑄=(A,X,𝑃)only if𝑢∈𝑉𝑖and for
a partial matching node 𝑣∈𝑉𝑖where𝑖∈{1,...,𝑘}, there exists
𝑢∈𝑉𝑖−1such that𝑣∈N(𝑢,𝐸𝑖−1).
3543KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Hanhua Xiao et al.
Proof. First, the necessary condition for an admissible data
perturbation holds by Definition 3.3 and 5.1. Second, since 𝑣∈𝑉𝑖,
∃𝑝(𝑣0,...,𝑢,𝑣)⊲𝑃(˜𝑣0,˜𝑣𝑖), where𝑣0∉𝑉0and𝑣0has attribute
A. Thus,𝑝(𝑣0,...,𝑢)⊲𝑃(˜𝑣0,˜𝑣𝑖−1)and𝑢is a match for ˜𝑣𝑖−1. It
suffices to prove that 𝑢∉𝑉𝑖−1. If𝑢∈𝑉𝑖−1, then one can find a path
instance𝑝(𝑣0,...,𝑢,...,𝑐)⊲𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐), which contradicts that 𝑣0∉𝑉0.
Hence, we conclude that 𝑢∈𝑉𝑖−1. □
By Lemma 5.2, we can reduce the search space for data perturba-
tions to the partial matching set. Also, any partial matching node
at level𝑖is linked to a partial matching node at level 𝑖−1via
edge type𝐸𝑖−1. Hence, we compute the partial matching sets as
follows: we initialize 𝑉0as the nodes with attribute Athat are not
in𝑉0, i.e.,𝑉0=VA−𝑉0and, at each subsequent level 𝑖>0, we
obtain𝑉𝑖=N(𝑉𝑖−1,𝐸𝑖−1)−𝑉𝑖.
Relevance-based Reduction. Admissibility-based reduction guar-
antees that each perturbation from the new search space is ad-
missible. However, if the relevance of a data perturbation is 0, the
perturbation does not contribute to the final deviation measure.
Therefore, we define relevant perturbations as:
Definition 5.3 (Relevant Data Perturbation). An edge𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣)
is arelevant data perturbation at level𝑖if𝑒is an admissible data
perturbation andS(𝑒)>0.
Lemma 5.4. An admissible perturbation 𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣)is relevant for
edge type𝐸𝑖of an OF𝑄=(A,X,𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐))only if𝑣∈𝑉𝑖+1.
Proof. For an admissible perturbation 𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣)of type𝐸𝑖to
be head-relevant, there must exist a matching instance 𝑝(𝑣0,...,𝑢,
𝑣,...,𝑐)⊲𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐)after adding 𝑒, which implies that ∃𝑝(𝑣,...,𝑐)⊲
𝑃(˜𝑣𝑖+1,𝑐). Note that if∃𝑢′∈N(𝑣,𝐸−1
𝑖)∩𝑉𝑖, we can build a path
instance𝑝∗by concatenating three path instances, 𝑝1(𝑣0,...,𝑢′)⊕
𝑝2(𝑢′,𝐸𝑖,𝑣)⊕𝑝3(𝑣,...,𝑐). Ergo,𝑝∗⊲𝑃and thus𝑣∈𝑉𝑖+1; otherwise,
the head relevance would be 0. □
To check whether a perturbation 𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣)is relevant, we need
to calculate ifS(𝑒)>0, which involves finding cycles of length 6
that contain 𝑢and𝑣, a computationally expensive task [ 19,40].
In addition, there are a large number of node pairs to check for
relevant data perturbation, even for a single level. To enable efficient
pruning without cycle enumeration, we decompose the relevance
of a data perturbation into head and tail relevance as follows:
Definition 5.5 (Relevant Matching Set 𝑉∗
𝑖).𝑢∈𝑉𝑖ishead-relevant
if there exists 𝑟∈𝑉𝑖+1and𝑛∈N(𝑟,𝐸−1
𝑖)∩𝑉𝑖withS(𝑢,𝑛)>0.
𝑢∈𝑉𝑖istail-relevant if there exists 𝑟′∈𝑉𝑖+1and𝑛∈N(𝑢,𝐸𝑖)
withS(𝑛,𝑟′)>0. A relevant matching set 𝑉∗
𝑖for level𝑖contains
all head- and tail-relevant nodes.
Remark. Even though 𝑢∈𝑉∗
𝑖is not a sufficient condition for a
relevant data perturbation 𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣)at level𝑖, it reduces the search
space from|𝑉𝑖|·|L( ˜𝑣𝑖+1)|to|𝑉∗
𝑖|·|𝑉𝑖+1|, where|L(˜𝑣𝑖+1)|is the
number of node instances with the same type as the node variable
˜𝑣𝑖+1. This leads to significant computation savings, as we show
experimentally in Section 6. Putting everything together, we obtain
the following theorem for pruning the search space.
Theorem 5.6. An edge𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣)is an admissible and relevant
data perturbation at level 𝑖of an OF𝑄only if𝑢∈𝑉∗
𝑖and𝑣∈𝑉𝑖+1.

Algorithm for Data Perturbation Space Reduction. Apart from
reducing the search space, 𝑉∗
𝑖can be efficiently computed from the
matching node sets 𝑉𝑖,𝑉𝑖+1and the partial matching set 𝑉𝑖, in linear
time. Algorithm 2 illustrates the combined process for admissibility-
and relevance-based reduction. For a given level 𝑖with edge type 𝐸𝑖,
we compute three sets, namely e𝑉𝑖(Lines 2–5), d𝑉𝑖+1(Lines 6–9)
and𝑉∗
𝑖(Lines 10–14). Figure 5 depicts the relationship among e𝑉𝑖,
d𝑉𝑖+1and𝑉∗
𝑖.e𝑉𝑖denotes the set of head-relevant nodes, which are
computed from the partial matching set 𝑉𝑖. Directly computing
the relevant matching set 𝑉∗
𝑖frome𝑉𝑖is expensive, as it requires
enumerating 3-hop paths between nodes from e𝑉𝑖to𝑉𝑖+1. Hence, we
compute the intermediate set d𝑉𝑖+1, which is obtained by first finding
neighbors of e𝑉𝑖via edge type 𝐸𝑖, i.e.,N(e𝑉𝑖,𝐸𝑖), and including a
node𝑢∈N(e𝑉𝑖,𝐸𝑖)tod𝑉𝑖+1if𝑢shares at least a common neighbor
with the nodes in 𝑉𝑖+1. As such, any node 𝑢∈d𝑉𝑖+1serves as a
bridge between e𝑉𝑖and𝑉𝑖+1to find tail-relevant nodes. Finally, if a
node𝑢∈e𝑉𝑖connects to another node 𝑛∈d𝑉𝑖+1via edge type 𝐸𝑖,𝑢
is added to𝑉∗
𝑖as it is both head- and tail-relevant.

Producing𝑉∗
𝑖only requires a constant number of linear scans
on the neighbors of the matching set 𝑉𝑖and the partial matching

is𝑂(Í
𝑖|E(𝑉𝑖)|), since we can incrementally compute 𝑉𝑖+1from𝑉𝑖.
To support efficient edge look-ups in Lines 4 and 8, we build a hash
table onN(𝑉𝑖)for each𝑖={0,...,𝑘}in𝑂(Í

d𝑉𝑖+1and𝑉∗

is𝑂Í

reduction yields a time complexity of 𝑂Í

Exact Algorithm. The exact algorithm for data perturbation also
executes in two stages, as shown in Algorithm 3. In the first stage
3544How to Avoid Jumping to Conclusions: Measuring the Robustness of Outstanding Facts in Knowledge Graphs KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
(Lines 1–4), we obtain the perturbation space by the efficient space
reduction just described. In the second stage (Lines 5–20), we eval-
uate all possible data perturbations of 𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣)where𝑢∈𝑉∗
𝑖,𝑣∈
𝑉𝑖+1at all levels. We calculate the head relevance Sℎin Lines 9–11,
followed by computing the tail relevance S𝑡in Lines 12–14 when
the head relevance is greater than 0. If the perturbation is relevant,
i.e.,S(𝑒)>0, we evaluate its strikingness measure in Lines 16–20.
We execute a BackwardPass similar to the one in Algorithm 1 to get
the perturbed peer entity set 𝑉′
0. Since only 𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣)is augmented
to the KG, we run BackwardPass for 𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑢)from level𝑖<𝑘(in-
stead of𝑃(˜𝑣0,𝑐)from level𝑘) to get the additional peer entities
when considering 𝑒. After enumerating the data perturbation space,
we normalize the weighted sum of I(𝑄′)and apply Equation 1 to
compute the deviation measure Δ(𝑄)in Lines 21–22.

The complexity of the first stage is 𝑂(Í
𝑖(|E(𝑉𝑖)|+|E(𝑉𝑖)|)). In
the second stage, at each level 𝑖, the number of potentially relevant
data perturbations is |𝑉∗
𝑖|·|𝑉𝑖+1|. For each such perturbation, the
time to compute the head and tail relevance is 𝑂(|𝐸𝑖|·𝐽), where𝐽
is the average time to evaluate S(𝑐,𝑐′). The BackwardPass and
strikingness evaluation take 𝑂(Í
𝑗<𝑖|𝐸𝑗|)time. To perform this
process at all levels, the exact algorithm runs in 𝑂(Í
𝑖(|𝑉∗
𝑖|·|𝑉𝑖+1|)·Í
𝑗<𝑖|𝐸𝑗|·|𝐸𝑖|·𝐽)time.
Sampling-based Approximation. Unlike entity perturbation
where the perturbation space is bounded by the number of nodes
in the KG in the worst case, the data perturbation space has a qua-
dratic complexity of 𝑂(Í
𝑖|𝑉∗
𝑖|·|𝑉𝑖+1|). Thus, it is often prohibitive
to obtain the PRD for data perturbation explicitly. We devise a
sampling strategy to estimate the data PRD on the fly. We first ran-
domly sample a level 𝑖for the𝑘-hop query𝑃of the OF𝑄(A,X,𝑃).
For each sampled level 𝑖, we randomly sample 𝑢from𝑉∗
𝑖and𝑣
from𝑉𝑖+1. Seen as a plausible edge 𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣), the sampled node
pair has a probability PU(𝑒)=1
𝑘·|𝑉∗
𝑖|·|𝑉𝑖+1|under our sampling dis-
tributionUto evaluate the data PRD D. We then execute Lines 7–
20 in Algorithm 3 to compute the head-tail relevance S(𝑒)andthe strikingness of the perturbed OF, I(𝑄′). Since PD(𝑒)∝S(𝑒)
by a normalizing constant 𝑐=Í
𝑒S(𝑒), we employ importance
sampling to estimate E𝑄′∼Dby taking𝑛samples underUas
𝜇𝑛=Í𝑛
𝑗=1I(𝑄′
𝑗)𝑤(𝑒𝑗)Í𝑛
𝑗=1𝑤(𝑒𝑗), where𝑤(𝑒)=S(𝑒)/PU(𝑒). Since all sam-
ples are i.i.d., 𝜇𝑛converges to E𝑄′∼Dwith probability 1[17]; the
convergence rate is again 𝑂(1/√𝑛), as mentioned in Section 4.
6 Experiments
In this section, we evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our
framework. First, we present the experimental setup.
Knowledge Graph (KG) and Outstanding Facts (OFs). We use
the Wikidata KG [ 44] as our data source here, while Appendix D
also includes experiments on DBpedia [ 29]. We extract a subgraph
from the Wikidata dump [ 48] with 17.8M entities and 63.4M edges
featuring human-related knowledge. Following existing studies that
mine OFs related to celebrities [ 55,58], we select 100 celebrities, the
top 70 from “The Celebrity 100” [ 13] and the top 30 from “Forbes
Billionaires” [ 15]. We divide them into three groups, Art,Sports,
andBusiness, based on their profile information. We extract OFs
for these celebrities using FMiner [ 55], the only state-of-the-art
method that can scale to large KGs. To extract an OF for a celebrity
group, we input a randomly selected celebrity as the “target” into
FMiner. We assess the scalability of our perturbation analysis by
varying the path query length 𝑘from 2 to 4. Note that longer path
queries are rare in practice, as they are difficult to interpret in
natural language [ 55]. For each group and path length setting, we
mine 50 OFs with a strikingness score of at least 0.8.
Default Sampling Setting. Given that the sizes of the entity and
data perturbation spaces can be directly obtained, we set the sample
size𝑛for the sampling-based algorithms to 𝑛=𝑟𝑁, where𝑟is the
sampling rate and 𝑁is the size of the respective perturbation space.
By default, we set 𝑟=5%for both perturbation regimes.
Hardware Configuration. We conduct all experiments on a Linux
server with a 48-core CPU@3.45GHz and 256GB memory. All algo-
rithms are implemented1using C++ with -O3 optimization.
6.1 Empirical Study on Entity Perturbation
Efficiency. We execute the exact and sampling algorithms for all
OFs under the default setting ( 𝑟=5%). Figure 6 presents the ratio of
OFs on which the perturbation analysis is completed in 5 minutes.
The sampling algorithm processes almost all OFs in 5 minutes. The
exact algorithm performs well in certain scenarios, e.g., 𝑘=3for
Art,𝑘=4for Art and Sports. As elaborated in Section 4, a larger
perturbation space implies a longer execution time. Table 2 indi-
cates the average size of the entity perturbation space for different
celebrity groups and path lengths. Notably, longer paths often lead
to a smaller entity perturbation space, as they impose more con-
straints on matching instances, rendering OFs with longer paths
easier to analyze. For example, both exact and sampling algorithms
perform well on the Sports group for 𝑘=4, where the size of the
perturbation space is only 13%of that for𝑘=2. We also observe
that the perturbation space of the Business group is the largest
since the Business OFs contain more “general” edge types (e.g.,
1Code and data are available at https://github.com/xhh232018/RobustFacts.

position held) with numerous edge instances in the associated path
queries. As a result, the exact method completes the perturbation
analysis for only half of the Business OFs. Nevertheless, even in
that challenging setting, the sampling algorithm still analyzes over
90% of the OFs within 5 minutes. Appendix D presents (in Fig-
ure 16) the completion ratios for 1-minute and 3-minute time limits,
demonstrating similar trends.
Error Analysis. For a given OF 𝑄, we use|Δ∗(𝑄)−Δ(𝑄)|to
measure the error of the sampling algorithm, where Δ∗(𝑄)is the
estimation of the true deviation measure Δ(𝑄). To evaluate the con-
vergence speed, we vary the sampling rate 𝑟, testing three different
values: 1%,5%, and 10%. To measure the error, we must focus on
those OFs where the exact algorithm completes the perturbation
analysis within 5 minutes. We run the sampling algorithm ten times
for each of these OFs and report the mean error per celebrity group
and path length. Figure 7a presents the error distribution of 3-hop
OFs, while Appendix D provides further results. With increasing
sample size, (i)the variance of the error decreases and (ii)the error
converges to a small range (2.7% on average) for all celebrity groups.
This result follows the convergence analysis in Section 4.

OF Robustness. To scrutinize the problem further, Figure 7b de-
picts deviation values Δ(𝑄)for all mined OFs where the exact
algorithm terminates within 5 minutes. Notably, under entity per-
turbation, the strikingness scores of most OFs deviate marginally
from the score expected by the entity PRD, with an average devi-
ation of 6.8%. However, some OFs exhibit high deviation. Recall
that FMiner [ 55] mined the original OFs orthogonally to our work.
Figure 7b leads to two critical conclusions. First, the low average de-
viation of the OFs suggests the reliability of the miner. Meanwhile,outlier OFs with very high deviation evince that OF mining may
fumble, thus a rigorous perturbation analysis, as we propose, is
vital to assess the robustness of mined OFs before publicizing them.
Appendix B presents a case study on an OF about NBA players.
6.2 Empirical Study on Data Perturbation
Effectiveness of Perturbation Space Reduction. To assess the
effectiveness of our space reduction techniques, we report the sizes
of the perturbation spaces originally (‘Ori’), after admissibility-
based reduction (‘Adm’), and eventually after relevance-based re-
duction (‘Adm+Rel’) in Figure 8. Admissibility-based reduction
prunes over 50% of the edges in the original space (note that the
intra-bar partitions are in log scale) and relevance-based reduction
further prunes over 99% of the surviving edges on average; these
results attest to the effectiveness of our space reduction approach.

Efficiency. Figure 9 shows the ratio of OFs where data perturbation
analysis ends within 5 minutes. The sampling algorithm processes
over 90% of the OFs within 5 minutes. Unlike entity perturbation
(cf. Figure 6), the completion ratio drops as 𝑘grows, because longer
paths imply larger search space in data perturbation. In Appendix D,
we try 1-minute and 3-minute cutoffs, with aligned findings.

Error Analysis. As in Section 6.1, we select OFs where the exact
algorithm completes the perturbation analysis in 5 minutes. Fig-
ure 10a presents the approximation error for each celebrity group
for 3-hop OFs. We defer further results to Appendix D. The estima-
tion converges as we increase the sampling rate. When 𝑟=10%,
the error is <1% in most cases. Generally, the error is smaller than
entity perturbation because adding an edge to the KG alters the peer
entity set much less drastically than matching a different path query.
The smaller extent of perturbation naturally implies a smaller error.
OF Robustness. We present the deviation values for OFs under
data perturbation in Figure 10b. The values are generally smaller
than entity perturbation because data perturbation is less invasive
to the peer entity set, as explained in the previous paragraph. The

average deviation under data perturbation is 2.6%. Nonetheless, we
also detect OFs that exhibit large deviation and sensitivity to data
perturbation, seen as outliers in Figure 10b. To further showcase
our method, Appendix C analyzes an OF about US politics.
6.3 Crowdsourced User Study
While existing works on perturbation analysis rely primarily on
case studies to demonstrate their efficacy [ 2,30,52], we believe it
is valuable to complement case studies with users’ perspectives
for additional insight. To this end, we recruited 600 crowdsourced
participants from the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to validate
the effectiveness of our system for both types of perturbation.
We conduct an ablation analysis for the effectiveness of deviation
measures and counterarguments in assessing the robustness of OFs
(Appendix B details how deviation measures and counterarguments
are used in our case studies). We use 20 OFs with deviation values
ranging from 0.4%to48%. Each participant receives an OF and one
of the following: (1) the OF alone; (2) the OF and the corresponding
counterargument; or (3) the OF, the counterargument, and the
deviation value with an explanation of what the deviation means.
Given the information provided, participants are asked to rate their
agreement with a generalized statement on a scale from 1 (not likely)
to 10 (absolutely likely). Each setting is rated by 10 participants.
(a) Setting 1
 (b) Setting 2
 (c) Setting 3
Figure 11: Crowdsourced user study.
Figure 11 shows scatter plots with linear regression lines, which
show the average rating by participants of their agreement with the
generalized fact under each setting (10 responses for each point).
We verify statistical significance by the t-test for correlation. The
presentation of only an OF to participants (Setting 1) yields a pos-
itive correlation between the deviation measure and the average
rating (p-value 0.0005), implying a tendency to jump to conclusions
from a striking OF. When the OF comes with a counterargument
(Setting 2), the regression line slope falls (p-value 0.4643), yet the
decline is not statistically significant, indicating that the counterar-
gument alone does not suffice to hinder bias. Finally, when both a
counterargument and a deviation measure escort the OF (Setting 3),a negative correlation emerges between the rating and deviation
measure (p-value 0.0048). The statistically significant shift from
positive to negative correlation underscores the effectiveness of our
approach in enhancing users’ understanding of the context, thereby
preventing jumping to conclusions. Due to space limitations, we
refer to the technical report [ 54] for details on statistical hypothesis
testing.
7 Related Work
OF Mining. Early OF mining focused on top- 𝑘[10] and skyline
queries [ 5]. With advances in computational journalism and busi-
ness intelligence, OF mining within data subsets gained traction.
Some studies find a local subspace as the context that makes a tar-
get data point outstanding [ 50,57], while others identify streaks in
temporal data [ 11,27,37,51]. Such approaches work primarily on
relational databases, often on a single table, by defining constraints
to select context data. OF mining in KGs [ 58] finds OFs of a target
entity based on attribute rarity vs. peer entities defined by a graph
pattern. FMiner [ 55] introduces context entities to extract more
relevant OFs. Contrariwise, our work measures the robustness of
the given OFs mined from KGs.
Perturbation Analysis. Perturbation analysis is commonly used
in uncertain data management and mining [ 1,26]. Wu et al . [52]
applied it to computational fact-checking; they convert facts into
parameterized SQL queries and formulate the optimization prob-
lem of finding the parameter settings that yield the weakest results
under parameter sensitivity constraints. Asudeh et al . [2] propose
a method that perturbs data points to check whether trend facts
in temporal data remain valid. Lin et al . [30] propose perturbation
analysis with OLAP operations. Although our perturbation anal-
ysis shares the spirit of prior studies, previous methods focus on
relational data and are inapplicable to our setting.
8 Conclusion
We crafted a methodology to measure the robustness of outstanding
facts mined from knowledge graphs by perturbing entities and data.
We designed exact and approximate algorithms for both types of
perturbation, along with a novel strategy to effectively reduce the
data perturbation space and hence the computational cost. Experi-
ments on the Wikidata KG validate the efficiency of our proposals
and their effectiveness in mitigating the jumping conclusion bias. In
the future, we aim to expand perturbation analysis to KG aggrega-
tion queries [ 8,46] and study the robustness of other configurations,
such as stable matchings with a fairness objective [ 18,41,42,49].

A Head and Tail Relevance Rationale
In Figure 12, edge 𝑒=(‘Alibaba Group’ ,‘Reddit’) is a probable data
perturbation for the Reddit OF based on head relevance; both Al-
ibaba Group and Tencent are Chinese Internet conglomerates and
share common attributes in the KG, such as country, stock exchange,
and invested companies. However, retail companies Alibaba has
invested in, such as Farfetch, Sun Art Retail, and Fanatics, are less
relevant to Reddit, suggesting that Alibaba is unlikely to invest in
Reddit. Tail relevance addresses the discrepancy by downgrading
the relevance score. In Figure 13, taking tail relevance into account,
𝑒′=(‘Sequoia Capital’ ,‘Reddit’) emerges as a more suitable data
perturbation. Among Sequoia Capital’s backed companies in the KG,
there are several US social networking platforms like Instagram and
LinkedIn, that share services with Reddit. Additionally, both Reddit
and Google are partners of the Entertainment Consumers Associ-
ation and members of the Internet Association. This background
suggests Sequoia Capital’s investment in Reddit. Introducing 𝑒′
to the KG incorporates businesses that have received investments
from Sequoia Capital into the peer entity set, contradicting the
original OF. For instance, Nvidia is publicly listed.

B Case Study for Entity Perturbation
OFs are frequently used as evidence to bolster generalizations in
social platform discussions. An intriguing subject that arises on
Reddit is whether small-market teams prefer to draft international
players [ 34]. One could argue that no such preference exists, based
on the generalization of the following OF: Memphis Grizzlies, with
the29thmarket size among a total of 30 NBA teams [ 16], have
only drafted 6 foreign players, with a strikingness of 𝐼(𝑄)=0.91.
Figure 14 shows the associated path query. Through our entity
perturbation analysis, we derive an expected strikingness score
ofE𝑄′∼D=0.78, which is substantially lower than 0.91, with
deviation measured at Δ(𝑄)=16%. Furthermore, we return a coun-
terargument to the OF by identifying the perturbation 𝑄′thatmaximizes(𝐼(𝑄)−𝐼(𝑄′))·PD(𝑄′), whereDis the PRD for entity
perturbation. The counterargument is a relevant but less striking
perturbation than the original OF. Specifically, it suggests San Anto-
nio as the context entity to replace Memphis. San Antonio is related
to Memphis since both belong to the southwest NBA division and
are small-market teams (San Antonio ranking 20thamong NBA
teams). However, the San Antonio Spurs have drafted 25 foreign
players, a fact that brings the strikingness down to 0.72, revealing
that the original OF is not robust under entity perturbation.

C Case Study for Data Perturbation
To study a case on gender parity, we consider an OF on Janet Yellen,
the current US Secretary of the Treasury, who also held the chair of
the Federal Reserve in 2014–2018. According to the Wikidata KG,
among all politicians who have held any of Yellen’s posts, Yellen
is the only woman vs. 91 men. The strikingness score of this OF
is𝐼(𝑄)=0.99. Figure 15 depicts the associated path query. This
uniqueness could spawn a radical generalization about the gender
gap in US politics. Still, by data perturbation, the expected strik-
ingness is only E𝑄′∼D=0.91(down from 0.99) with associated
deviation Δ(𝑄)=8.8%, which is large by data perturbation stan-
dards. Indeed, our methodology suggests a data perturbation (edge
addition) that turns out to be valid in reality but missing from the
KG and refutes the original OF: Yellen also held the chair of the
Council of Economic Advisers, which adds three more women to
her peer entity set, namely Laura Tyson, Christina Romer, and
Cecilia Rouse. The addition brings strikingness down to 0.95. Our
methodology identified this data perturbation as highly relevant to

D Supplemental Experiments
Runtime Analysis for Wikidata OFs. Figures 16 and 17 show
the ratio of OFs where the entity and data perturbation analysis
completes within 1 and 3 minutes, respectively. Similarly, we con-
clude that the completion ratio decreases for a larger 𝑘in data
perturbation, which is consistent with the analysis in Section 6.
Error Analysis for Wikidata OFs. Figures 18–19 show the error
distribution per group under different path lengths for entity and
data perturbation, respectively. As in Section 6, the error variance
falls as the sample size grows and the error converges for all groups.
Experiments on DBpedia. To showcase the generality of our
method to any knowledge base, we gather a knowledge graph
of 5.2M entities and 26M edges from DBpedia [ 29], which has less
people-related information than Wikidata [ 44] (17.8M entities and

Figure 20, we present the distribution of OF deviation values per
group, under entity and data perturbation. The results are similar
to those of Figures 7b and 10b in the main paper. While most OFs
marginally deviate from their expected score, each group includes
a few outliers. Deviation values are lower under data perturbation
than under entity perturbation, as the former is less invasive to the
peer entity set, consistent with our findings on Wikidata.
