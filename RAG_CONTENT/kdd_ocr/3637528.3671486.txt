ABSTRACT
Building personalized recommender systems is especially impor-
tant due to the vast amount of user-generated textual content,
which offers deep insights into user preferences. The recent ad-
vancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
impacted research areas, mainly in Natural Language Processing
and Knowledge Discovery, giving these models the ability to handle
complex tasks and learn context.
This workshop is designed to bridge the research gap in the
use of generative models and user-generated text for personalized
systems. We aim to fully leverage generative models to develop
AI systems that are not only accurate but also focused on meeting
individual user needs. Building upon the momentum of previous
successful forums, this workshop seeks to engage a diverse audi-
ence from academia and industry, fostering a dialogue that incor-
porates fresh insights and anticipates over 50 attendees, including
key stakeholders in the field.

In today’s data-driven era, an abundance of user information is at
our disposal—ranging from historical articles, user reviews, and
textual feedback, to comprehensive survey responses. This multi-
faceted data serves as a rich reservoir of insights, painting a de-
tailed picture of user preferences and behaviors. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Generative AI stand at the forefront, revolution-
izing the way we harness and interpret this data. These advanced
technologies not only enable us to delve deep into the realm of
personalization but also significantly elevate the efficacy of recom-
mender systems Generative AI is expected to transcend traditional
boundaries by employing these models to craft personalized content
summaries that resonate with individual users, thereby enriching
their engagement and experience. Furthermore, these models offer
a unique capability to elucidate the rationale behind each recom-
mendation, fostering transparency and trust in automated systems.
However, research around developing personalized models and sys-
tems using these models on user-specific content is under-explored
and fairly new. Highlighting the workshop’s relevance and the ex-
ceptional opportunity it presents for groundbreaking discussions,
we are proud to feature a lineup of confirmed eminent speakers,
including industry and academic luminaries such as Ed Chi from
Google DeepMind, Dietmar Jannach from the University of Kla-
genfurt, Craig Macdonald from the University of Glasgow, and
Xiao-Ming Wu from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, with
Dawen Liang from Netflix and Suzan Verberne from Leiden Univer-
sity also invited. Their participation underscores the importance
and the interdisciplinary nature of the topics at hand.
This workshop focuses on the development and application of
Generative AI in order to develop personalized models with a wide
range of applications, not exclusive to only e-commerce platforms
but in any industry or academic setting. Research discussion about
using text and Generative AI models for personalized systems and
recommendation has remained fragmented across many workshops
and conferences, and there is a strong need for bringing together
researchers and practitioners working on these problems for a ro-
bust discussion and sharing of ideas. SIGKDD will remain one of

the top venues that is able to help with bringing scientists from
academia and industry and from different interests (whether it is
NLP and Generative AI or Recommender Systems or using Knowl-
edge discovery for personalization and user modeling) together.
We will welcome papers that leverage generative models with
a goal of recommendation and personalization on several topics
including but not limited to:
•Generative AI for contextual and sequential modeling in
recommender systems
•Personalized generative retrieval and recommendation mod-
els
•Instruction-tuned recommender systems
•LLM-driven personalized dialogue systems
•Personalized text and image generation
•Privacy in personalized generative AI systems
•Fairness, explainability, and transparency in LLM-driven
personalized and recommender systems
•Efficiency and scalability of LLM-driven personalization and
recommendation systems
•Evaluation of LLM-driven personalization and recommenda-
tion systems
2 WHY SIGKDD
Our proposed workshop focuses on the development and applica-
tion of personalized and recommender systems using generative
AI using text consumed and generated by users. We find KDD to
be a relevant venue for this workshop for a multitude of reasons.
First, modeling user behavior and mining user preferences to build
a variety of personalized systems (e.g. recommenders) has been a
focus for KDD and Knowledge Discovery in general. Further, the
topics of interest of this workshop coincide with relevant areas of
interest for KDD. Moreover, this workshop highlights the impor-
tance of leveraging generative AI for harnessing user-generated
text, which is currently under-represented at KDD and this work-
shop aims to bridge that gap. Lastly, KDD has a strong presence of
scholars and researchers from both industry and academia, making
it a suitable venue to encourages submissions from both industry
and academia, with an opportunity to focus on incorporating gener-
ative AI with personalization and recommendation system research
and applications.
