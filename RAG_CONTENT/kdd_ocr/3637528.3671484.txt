Abstract
In recent years, two-sided marketplaces have emerged as viable
business models in many real-world applications. In particular, we
have moved from the social network paradigm to a network with
two distinct types of participants representing the supply and de-
mand of a specific good. Examples of industries include but are
not limited to accommodation (Airbnb, Booking.com), video con-
tent (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok), ridesharing (Uber, Lyft), online
shops (Etsy, Ebay, Facebook Marketplace), music (Spotify, Ama-
zon), app stores (Apple App Store, Google App Store) or job sites
(LinkedIn). The traditional research in most of these industries
focused on satisfying the demand. OTAs would sell hotel accom-
modation, TV networks would broadcast their own content, or taxi
companies would own their own vehicle fleet. In modern examples
like Airbnb, YouTube, Instagram, or Uber, the platforms operate by
outsourcing the service they provide to their users, whether they
are hosts, content creators or drivers, and have to develop their
models considering their needs and goals.

1 Introduction
The two-sided marketplaces are almost entirely data-driven. Ma-
chine learning powered methods and algorithms are essential in
every aspect of two-sided marketplaces. This workshop aims to
bring practitioners of two-sided marketplaces together and discuss

https://doi.org/10.1145/3637528.3671484the evolution of content ranking, recommendation systems, and
data mining when solving for producers and consumers on these
platforms. Additionally, the workshop will cover Generative AI
applications in these platforms and how they are changing the
ecosystem.
2 Motivation
KDD has been emerging as a venue for researchers and practition-
ers to discuss topics and exchange ideas on two-sided marketplaces
in recent years, not only through the main conference but also with
well attended “KDD 2022 Workshop on Decision Intelligence and
Analytics for Online Marketplaces: Jobs, Ridesharing, Retail, and
Beyond” and “KDD 2020 Tutorial: Advances in Recommender Sys-
tems From Multi-stakeholder Marketplaces to Automated RecSys”.
This year, the topic is especially timely with the rise of Generative
AI and its dramatic impact on both the supply and demand sides
of the marketplace, which fundamentally change the ecosystem
in a way that is still poorly understood. Therefore, we think the
KDD conference would be a perfect venue for our workshop as the
attendees are a blend of industry practitioners and academic re-
searchers whose work is very related to the topics of our workshop.
We strongly believe our workshop will be well attended and expect
an audience of 100+ people.
3 Workshop Topics
The topics of this workshop include, but are not limited to, the
following:
•Search in two-sided marketplaces
•Recommendation Systems in two-sided marketplaces
•Generative AI applications in two-sided marketplaces
•Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications in two-
sided marketplaces
•Growth and Monetization for two-sided marketplaces
•Marketing Strategies
•Dynamic Pricing and Price Recommendations
•Fraud and fake-content Detection
•Privacy
•Lessons learned from deploying real-world systems
