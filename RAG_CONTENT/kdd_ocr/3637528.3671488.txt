Abstract
This workshop aims to explore the intersection of Generative AI
with the rich tapestry of financial data types, seeking to uncover
new methodologies and techniques that can enhance predictive
analytics, fraud detection, and customer insights across the sector.
By harnessing these advancements in AI, we can pave the way to
not only understand customer behavior but also anticipate their
needs more effectively, leading to superior customer outcomes
and more personalized services. Our objective is to shed light on
the challenges and opportunities presented by the diverse data
formats in finance. We aim to bridge the gap between the dominance
of traditional models for tabular data analysis and the emerging
potential of Generative AI to revolutionize the treatment of time
series, click streams, and other unstructured data forms.

1 Introduction
The financial sector is a complex ecosystem where data flows in
myriad forms, from structured tabular datasets to an arbitrarily
complex blend of images, audio, time-series. While tabular data has
traditionally been the backbone of financial analysis, with models
like XGBoost leading the field, the advent of Generative AI and
Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the approach
to handling more complex data types. We seek to highlight new
methodologies and techniques that can enhance predictive ana-
lytics, fraud detection and customer insights across the sector. By
harnessing these advancements in AI, we can pave the way to not
only understand customer behavior but also anticipate their needs
more effectively, leading to superior customer outcomes and more
personalized services.
Our objective is to shed light on the opportunities presented
by the diverse data formats in finance. We aim to bridge the gap
between the dominance of traditional models for tabular data anal-
ysis and the emerging potential of Generative AI to revolutionize
the treatment of multimodal data. The workshop will serve as a
platform for discussing how AI can be leveraged to provide compre-
hensive insights into finance problems transcending the limitations
of current models.
This event will be the seventh in a sequence of finance related
workshops we have organized at KDD. The first workshop was
held at KDD 2017, the second workshop at KDD 2019, the third
workshop at KDD 2020, the fourth workshop at KDD 2021, the fifth
workshop at KDD 2022 and the sixth workshop at KDD 2023.
The target audience includes researchers and practitioners from
both academia and the financial industry as well as executives,
product managers and government regulators.
