ABSTRACT
Time series classification and regression are rapidly evolving fields
that find areas of application in all domains of machine learning
and data science. This hands on tutorial will provide an accessible
overview of the recent research in these fields, using code examples
to introduce the process of implementing and evaluating an esti-
mator. We will show how to easily reproduce published results and
how to compare a new algorithm to state-of-the-art. Finally, we
will work through real world examples from the field of Electroen-
cephalogram (EEG) classification and regression. EEG machine
learning tasks arise in medicine, brain-computer interface research
and psychology. We use these problems to how to compare algo-
rithms on problems from a single domain and how to deal with
data with different characteristics, such as missing values, unequal
length and high dimensionality. The latest advances in the fields of
time series classification and regression are all available through
theaeon toolkit, an open source, scikit-learn compatible frame-
work for time series machine learning which we use to provide our
code examples.

1 TUTORIAL OUTLINE
In the first part of the tutorial, we present an overview of recent
time series research into classification and regression, including
an introduction to the aeon time series machine learning toolkit
which we will use to demonstrate methods. This will provide a
broad overview of the research landscape and the open source
implementations in the aeon toolkit. At each stage, we will pro-
vide interactive coding examples demonstrating key methods for
prediction and exploratory analysis. In the second part, we will
then use Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification and regres-
sion as a use case to demonstrate how to tackle real world time
series classification and regression problems, including building
and evaluating predictive models. We will demonstrate some of the
strengths and weaknesses in terms of scalability and interpretability
of highlighted approaches.
Time series classification (TSC) [ 1,13] involves fitting a model
from a continuous, ordered sequence of real valued observations (a
time series) to a discrete response variable. Time series extrinsic
regression (TSER) [ 5,6,15] predicts a continuous response vari-
able. Time series can be univariate (a single variable observed at
each time point) or multivariate (multiple variables observed at
each time point). TSC and TSER problems come from various do-
mains, including medical signals such as electrocardiogram and
EEG; Human activity recognition and other motion data; spectro-
grams; audio; electricity usage; and many more with industrial and
scientific applications. In the tutorial, we will highlight how we
learn from time series data using the latest techniques for both
classification [ 3,4,7–9,12–14] and regression [ 6,10,11], and why
these techniques are preferable to more traditional machine learn-
ing approaches. We group algorithms by the representation used
to differentiate between series. For each category of algorithms we
provide an overview of recent research, give hands-on examples of

how they are implemented and compare performance of published
algorithms on the UCR archive [2].
All hands-on examples will use the open source aeon toolkit1.
aeon is ascikit-learn compatible toolkit for time series machine
learning tasks such as forecasting, classification, regression, clus-
tering, segmentation and anomaly detection. It provides a broad
library of efficiently implemented time series algorithms, includ-
ing the latest advances, and it interfaces with other time series
packages to provide a single framework for algorithm comparison.
For ease of use, aeon has a unified interface for estimators with
standardised methods and base functionality for both its classifiers
and regressors. To avoid repetition and redundant information,
when providing examples for different algorithm types we also
cover relevant functionality available in the aeon toolkit alongside
it, such as model selection and visualisation. Throughout the topic
we also aim to cover how our framework can be extended to include
new estimators, and how to benchmark the time series algorithms
shown using the tools available.
