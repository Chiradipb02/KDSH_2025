ABSTRACT
Uncertainty reasoning and quantification play a critical role in de-
cision making across various domains, prompting increased atten-
tion from both academia and industry. As real-world applications
become more complex and data-driven, effectively handling un-
certainty becomes paramount for accurate and reliable decision
making. This workshop focuses on the critical topics of uncer-
tainty reasoning and quantification in decision making. It provides
a platform for experts and researchers from diverse backgrounds
to exchange ideas on cutting-edge techniques and challenges in
this field. The interdisciplinary nature of uncertainty reasoning and
quantification, spanning artificial intelligence, machine learning,
statistics, risk analysis, and decision science, will be explored. The
workshop aims to address the need for robust and interpretable
methods for modeling and quantifying uncertainty, fostering rea-
soning decision-making in various domains. Participants will have
the opportunity to share research findings and practical experi-
ences, promoting collaboration and advancing decision-making
practices under uncertainty.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have received tremendous atten-
tion and achieved great success in various applications, such as
image and video analysis, natural language processing, recommen-
dation systems, and drug discovery. However, inherent uncertain-
ties derived from different root causes have been serious hurdles
for DNNs to find robust and trustworthy solutions for real-world
problems [ 1–4]. A lack of consideration of such uncertainties may
lead to unnecessary risk. A deep learning-based medical assistant
may misdiagnose cancer as a benign tumor. Uncertainty has be-
come increasingly important, and it has been attracting attention
from academia and industry due to its increased popularity in real-
world applications with uncertain concerns. It also emphasizes
decision-making problems, such as autonomous driving and diag-
nosis systems. Therefore, the wave of research at the intersection
of uncertainty reasoning and quantification in data mining and
machine learning has also influenced other fields of science, includ-
ing computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement
learning, and social science.
2 RELEVANCE TO SIGKDD
ACM SIGKDD conference is the premier international forum for
knowledge discovery and data mining researchers and practitioners
from academia, industry, and government to share their research
findings, results, and experiences. The organizers and invited PC
members of this workshop have a wealth of experience and a strong
interest in uncertainty reasoning and quantification and they come
from different backgrounds in academia, industry, and government.
Knowledge discovery and data mining are core uncertainty rea-
soning and quantification topics, with significant implications in
uncertainty reasoning and quantification, but have not yet received
significant attention from the uncertainty reasoning and quan-
tification community at SIGKDD. This workshop will provide a
great opportunity for all SIGKDD attendees to exchange ideas and
thoughts on opportunities, challenges, and techniques in uncer-
tainty reasoning and quantification and it will build a bridge of
communication for people with different backgrounds and promote
the future development of uncertainty reasoning and quantification
in decision making.

4 INVITED KEYNOTE SPEAKER
We are proposing to have 3 keynote speakers.
•Eyke Hüllermeier (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München).
Dr. Eyke Hüllermeier is a full Professor at the Institute of
Informatics at LMU Munich, Germany, where he holds the
Chair of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. He
received his PhD in Computer Science from Paderborn Uni-
versity in 1997, and a Habilitation degree in 2002. His re-
search interests are centered around methods and theoret-
ical foundations of artificial intelligence, with a particular
focus on machine learning, preference modeling, and rea-
soning under uncertainty. He has published more than 400
