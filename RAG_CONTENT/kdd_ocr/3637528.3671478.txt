ABSTRACT
Machine learning applications are rapidly adopted by industry
leaders in any field. The growth of investment in AI-driven solu-
tions,including the emerging field of General AI (GenAI), has cre-
ated new challenges in managing Data Science and ML resources,
people and projects as a whole. The discipline of managing applied
machine learning teams, requires a healthy mix between agile prod-
uct development tool-set and a long term research oriented mindset.
The abilities of investing in deep research while at the same time
connecting the outcomes to significant business results create a
large knowledge based on management methods and best practices
in the field. The Third KDD Workshop on Applied Machine Learn-
ing Management brings together applied research managers from
various fields to share methodologies and case-studies on man-
agement of ML teams, products, and projects, achieving business
impact with advanced AI-methods.

1 WORKSHOP
The workshop focuses on main aspects of a successful ML resource
management: project lifecycle, people management, product devel-
opment, ML quality and excellence and the exploration of evolving
landscape of General AI applications. We focus on a combination
of soft skills applications along with data-driven and empirical
approaches to efficiently resolve ML management challenges.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3637528.3671478The ML projects life-cycle management include research re-
sources allocation and collaboration with product development. We
solicit presenting real case-studies and working model proposals.
The people management aspects include the unique properties of
ML talents and the specific challenges in building AI organisations,
fostering research culture and growing research driven individuals
in a business driven environment. Finally, the ML excellence topic
include aspects of high-quality ML models and working processes,
together with tooling and best practices to ensure them.

3 PREVIOUS EDITIONS
The first edition of The Workshop on Applied Machine Learn-
ing Management [ 2] was held at KDD’22, Washington DC. The
workshop had about 150 in-person participants (out of 220 pre-
registered), who took an active part in the talks, roundtable dis-
cussions and the social event afterhours. The workshop included
2 keynote talks which had gain a lot of attention from industry-
oriented participants. The program consisted of 5 contributed talks
and 6 roundtable sessions, selected out of total 22 submissions, by
total of 43 authors from all over the world. The second edition was
held at KDD’23, Long Beach, CA [ 1],included 2 keynote talks, 5

KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Dmitri Goldenberg et al.
contributed talks and 5 round-table discussions (out of 19 submis-
sions), with an evening social event, attracting more than 200 of
the conference participants during the day.
The covered topics focused on:
•Machine Learning Research Phase Tracking
•Stakeholder and Team Management in Data Science
•Comparing Model Development Practices in B2B vs B2C
•Successfully Introducing ML to New Organizations
•Building New ML Teams and organizations
•Scrum in Machine Learning
•Generative AI product development
•Centralized vs Embedded models for ML teams

4 INTENDED AUDIENCE
The key target audience for this workshop are ML leaders, in differ-
ent industries and academia, ranging from small teams to depart-
ment and company leaders. Moreover, the workshop can provide
unique insights to any ML practitioner about the processes of man-
aging applied research and share knowledge and ideas between
different organisations. While hosted at an academic venue, the
applied nature of the workshop allows to apply data-driven ap-
proaches on the art of machine learning management.
5 RELEVANCE TO THE COMMUNITY
The topics of Machine Learning, AI and Data Science leadership
are widely discussed in key venues and dedicated events. In re-
cent years the management of applied ML research attracted more
professional focus, which created special interest groups and data-
driven approaches to resolve management challenges. We observe
more papers focusing not only on ML solutions themselves but
also on the meta aspects of project life-cycles, development pro-
cesses, machine learning excellence and democratisation of reusable
components. These aspects, alongside ML talent management con-
siderations, have a growing interest for a dedicated workshop. Last
year participation, alongside with multiple positive feedback give us
a better understanding of the growing interest in those topics, and
how crucial is to include such workshops in data science venues.
