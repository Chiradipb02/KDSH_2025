Abstract
Evaluating the degree of reproduction of
copyright-protected content by language mod-
els (LMs) is of significant interest to the AI
and legal communities. Although both literal
and non-literal similarities are considered by
courts when assessing the degree of reproduc-
tion, prior research has focused only on lit-
eral similarities. To bridge this gap, we in-
troduce COPYBENCH , a benchmark designed
to measure both literal and non-literal copy-
ing in LM generations. Using copyrighted
fiction books as text sources, we provide au-
tomatic evaluation protocols to assess literal
and non-literal copying, balanced against the
model utility in terms of the ability to recall
facts from the copyrighted works and generate
fluent completions. We find that, although lit-
eral copying is relatively rare, two types of non-
literal copying—event copying and character
copying—occur even in models as small as 7B
parameters. Larger models demonstrate signifi-
cantly more copying, with literal copying rates
increasing from 0.2% to 10.5% and non-literal
copying from 2.3% to 5.9% when comparing
Llama3-8B and 70B models, respectively. We
further evaluate the effectiveness of current
strategies for mitigating copying and show that
(1) training-time alignment can reduce literal
copying but may increase non-literal copying,
and (2) current inference-time mitigation meth-
ods primarily reduce literal but not non-literal
copying.
1 Introduction
The extent to which language models (LMs) gener-
ate text that closely resembles copyright-protected
material is of significant interest to the AI, con-
tent creation, and legal communities (Meeus et al.,
2024; Henderson et al., 2023; Ippolito et al., 2023;
Carlini et al., 2023). While previous research often

focused on literal copying (e.g., verbatim reproduc-
tion) to assess similarity to copyrighted text, real-
world relevance typically involves more nuanced
similarities, such as stories with identical plots and
characters to those in copyrighted fictional books
but which are not word-for-word identical (Hender-
son et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023b). These nuanced
analyses are usually performed manually by ex-
perts, making it challenging to scale with the rapid
development of new models and increasing legal
concerns.
To bridge the gap, we introduce COPYBENCH ,
a new benchmark and automatic evaluation proto-
cols designed to assess reproduction of copyright-
protected text by LMs (Figure 1). We evaluate two
categories of copying: literal andnon-literal copy-
ing. Literal copying assesses the extent to which
a model can reproduce copyright-protected con-
tent exactly as it appears in the source material. In

contrast, non-literal copying evaluates whether a
model generates outputs that, despite differing in
surface form (e.g., through paraphrasing), exhibit
a high degree of overlap in content. To the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first that evalu-
ates non-literal reproduction of copyrighted works
in language model generation. In order to study
the trade-offs between the unintended copying and
the desired utilities of LMs, we also quantify two
aspects of desired utilities: fact recall , i.e., an-
swering questions about book content, and fluency .
Our benchmark therefore allows for the evaluation
of levels of copyright work reproduction, overall
model utility, and any associated trade-offs. We
curate a dataset using a list of popular copyright-
protected fictions, sourced from the famous Cliffs-
Notes study guides,1which provide human-written
plot summary for each book.
We evaluate a range of the state-of-the-art LMs
onCOPYBENCH , including open-weight models
and proprietary models, consisting of three model
families, namely Llama2 (Touvron et al., 2023)
family, Llama3 (AI@Meta, 2024) family, Mis-
tral (Jiang et al., 2023, 2024) family, GPT-3.5-
Turbo, and GPT-4-Turbo.
Our evaluation reveals that, while extensive lit-
eral copying is relatively rare in some models
with relative small size, all models exhibit mean-
ingful levels of non-literal copying (Figure 2-a).
Moreover, large models demonstrate a significantly
higher level of copying. For example, in literal,
event, and character copying, the rates for Llama3
models increase from 0.2% to 10.5%, from 2.3% to
6.9%, from 4.5% to 15.6% when comparing the 8B
and 70B models, respectively. Larger models also
1https://www.cliffsnotes.com/demonstrate higher utility, such as an increase in
F1 score of the fact recall for Llama3 from 18.6 to
40.0, highlighting a clear connection between min-
imizing the reproduction of copyrighted work and
maximizing overall utility (Figure 2-b). In propri-
etary models, the transition from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4
interestingly reduces literal copying but increases
non-literal copying.
Additionally, our datasets are designed to bench-
mark methods for potentially reducing copying be-
havior, broadly categorized into training methods
(instruction tuning and chat alignment) and infer-
ence methods (e.g., MemFree decoding; Ippolito
et al. 2023). We find that different instruction-
tuning methods have varying levels of effective-
ness. Specifically, Llama2-Chat (Touvron et al.,
2023) and Llama3-Instruct (AI@Meta, 2024) sig-
nificantly reduce copying behavior, though the
mechanism remains unclear due to the use of
closed-source data. In contrast, the open-source
model Tulu2 (Ivison et al., 2023), which is based on
Llama2 and further trained with fully open-sourced
instruction tuning and preference data, shows a
weaker reduction, indicating the need for open ef-
forts in further research. Regarding inference meth-
ods, MemFree decoding, which avoids n-gram
copying from copyright-protected data when deter-
mining the next token, successfully reduces literal
copying but does not reduce non-literal copying
(Figure 2-c). These results highlight an urgent need
to study effective mitigation approaches that can
alleviate both literal and non-literal reproduction of
copyrighted contents while preserving utility. To
foster community efforts, we open source our data
and code.
22 Background
In this section, we review copyright law and rele-
vant court cases on copyright infringement (Sec-
tion 2.1), as well as prior work in AI on benchmark-
ing and mitigating copyright risks (Section 2.2).
We highlight the gap between real-world legal risks
and the current research aimed at addressing poten-
tial copyright issues.
Copyright issues can be associated with each
component of the generative-AI supply chain (Lee
et al., 2023b), including data collection (Min
et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Chang et al.,
2023; Karamolegkou et al., 2023), model train-
ing (Vyas et al., 2023), and generation and deploy-
ment (Meeus et al., 2024; Ippolito et al., 2023).
Our work focuses on the infringement risks in LM-
generated content, although other stages may also
present infringement risks even if the outputs do
not infringe.
2.1 Legal Framework of Copyright
U.S. Copyright Law. United States copyright
law prohibits the reproduction of a substantial
amount of the author’s original expression from
a copyrighted work, a test usually described as sub-
stantial similarity (Lee et al., 2023b; Henderson
et al., 2023). In addition, the fair-use doctrine al-
lows some limited uses without permission from
the copyright owner, even when there is substantial
similarity.
Literal and Non-Literal Copying. The test for
copyright infringement has always included both
literal and non-literal copying. As a canonical copy-
right case from 1930 that is still universally fol-
lowed today explained:
It is of course essential . . . that the
[copy]right cannot be limited literally
to the text, else a plagiarist would es-
cape by immaterial variations. That has
never been the law . . . Upon any work
. . . a great number of patterns of increas-
ing generality will fit equally well, as
more and more of the incident is left
out(Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.,
1930).
Literal copying—extensive and verbatim copying
without significant alteration—is more likely to be
infringing (Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Na-
tion Enterprises, 1985). Yet, non-literal copying
of an author’s style or the use of similar plots andcharacters can also infringe (Dr. Seuss Enterprises,
L.P. v. ComicMix LLC, 2020; Paramount Pictures
Corp. v. Axanar Productions, Inc., 2017). On the
other hand, altering the original work with new ex-
pression to change its meaning or message is more
likely to be a non-infringing transformative fair use
(Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.). In addition,
facts and ideas are generally not copyrightable, and
the allowable scope of copying from a primarily
factual work is greater (Feist Publications, Inc. v.
Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc., 1991). There-
fore, it is generally beneficial for AI systems to
learn and utilize facts in LM outputs.
Non-literal Copying Analysis. It is generally ac-
cepted that the heart of determination lies in the
extent of similarity between the two works (Re-
bikoff, 2001; Henderson et al., 2023). In a famous
article, legal scholar Zechariah Chaffee identified
“the sequence of events and the development of the
interplay of the characters” as “the pattern of the
work” that is subject to protection (Chafee, 1945).
As one court described it, “the essence of a novel
or any other story for that matter, is the plot, plan,
arrangement, characters and dialogue therein con-
tained” (Bartels, 1965). Inspired by these analy-
ses, we evaluate non-literal copying by identifying
the production of events and characters in creative-
writing outputs of language models.
2.2 Evaluating and Mitigating Copyright
Risks in LMs
Benchmarking. Most research on LM copyright
evaluation has focused on literal copying, i.e.,
analyzing model outputs for near-exact overlaps
with copyrighted snippets (Henderson et al., 2023;
Meeus et al., 2024; Ippolito et al., 2023; Carlini
et al., 2023). However, to bridge the gap to real-
world practices, it is necessary to study higher-level
semantic similarities.
Lee et al. (2023a) evaluate the replication of
paraphrases and ideas in language model output
through the lens of plagiarism rather than copyright
infringement. But plagiarism is primarily an ethi-
cal academic rule about giving proper attribution
for the use of other people’s ideas, while copyright
infringement is a legal rule against using an au-
thor’s particular expression of ideas (Green, 2002;
Cyphert, 2023). Paraphrasing facts from a source
might constitute plagiarism but not copyright in-
fringement; copying long passages with proper at-
tribution might be copyright infringement but not
3plagiarism. The two require different analyses and
benchmarks.
Lu et al. (2024) and He et al. (2024) explored
semantic similarities in image generation, empha-
sizing the replication of symbols, content, and style
in image generation. Our work, in contrast, focuses
on text outputs from LMs.
Concurrently with our work, Wei et al. (2024)
and Liu et al. (2024) also study copyright risks in
LM generation. However, their focus is primarily
on benchmarking literal copying and its mitigation
methods, whereas our work explores non-literal
copying as well.
Mitigation. Mitigating copyright risk can be ad-
dressed both during training and inference. Train-
ing techniques involve data filtering (Min et al.,
2023; Golatkar et al., 2024) and specially designed
training algorithms (Li et al., 2022; Mireshghallah
et al., 2023), unlearning (Eldan and Russinovich,
2023), and alignment techniques (Henderson et al.,
2023), which often require significant computa-
tional resources. Inference-time methods designed
to prevent near-identical overlap between the gen-
erated output and copyright-protected content in-
clude output filtering (Ziegler, 2021) and decoding
methods (Ippolito et al., 2023; Ginart et al., 2022;
Flemings et al., 2024). Previous methods are often
evaluated solely on their ability to reduce literal
copying, with little exploration of their effective-
ness in mitigating non-literal copying. The ques-
tion of how well these methods balance copyright
risks and utility remains open.
2.3 Memorization and Extraction in LMs
The root cause of copying behaviour is the mem-
orization of training data in LMs, and then its re-
gurgitation in a provided context i.e. in response to
given prompts (Biderman et al., 2024; Carlini et al.,
2021; Nasr et al., 2023). Recent work studying
memorization has profiled patterns, such the impact
that the number of gradient updates, batch size, the
length of a sample, and the size of the model have
on its memorization (Huang et al., 2024; Prashanth
et al., 2024; Duan et al., 2024; Mireshghallah et al.,
2022). These works however, only study memo-
rization in the original context that the data point
appeared in, in the training corpus. They also fo-
cus on base models and not instruction-tuned ones.
Closely related to ours are Schwarzschild et al.
(2024); Kassem et al. (2024), which take an adver-
sarial approach, by optimizing prompts for the sakeof maximizing extraction. These works also look
into instruction tuned models and reveal higher
levels of memorization through prompt optmiza-
tion. Although our work is related to memorization
and extraction literature, the goals and assumptions
are slightly different: we are targeting copyrighted
material, and assessing risk with respect to the sur-
rounding legal framework. Extraction attacks are
primarily focused on retrieving training data, re-
gardless of its legality.
3 C OPYBENCH : Evaluating
Reproduction of Copyrighted Text
We introduce COPYBENCH , a benchmark that pro-
vides automatic evaluation of the reproduction of
popular copyright-protected fictions as well as the
utility of the model. In particular, we evaluate two
types of reproduction: literal andnon-literal copy-
ing. To the best of our knowledge, our work is
the first that evaluates non-literal reproduction of
copyrighted work in LMs.
3.1 Overview
Copying Evaluation. We consider two types
of similarity between the LM output and text
sources Figure 1. Literal copying occurs when
a model’s output contains near-identical portions
of the text source. In contrast, non-literal copying
occurs when a model’s outputs are similar to the
text source at a higher level of abstraction, even
if they are not word-for-word identical. This is
to evaluate the extent to which a generated story
is original when the language model is prompted
to write an original story. Although whether the
story is original or not is highly context dependent,
in this paper, we consider the similarity in events
and characters of a story, inspired by prior work in
copyright protection of literary work (Henderson
et al., 2023).
Utility Evaluation. We also analyze utility to
understand its correlation with copying reduction.
This involves fact recall , which evaluates whether
the model correctly recalls facts derived from the
source text, and the fluency of the text generated
by the model.
3.2 Source Text Collection
Our evaluation pipeline can be applied to various
sources of copyrighted works. In COPYBENCH , we
focus on fiction books (Meeus et al., 2024; Chang

et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023). For literal copy-
ing, we randomly sampled snippets from popular
copyright-protected fiction. To minimize copyright
risks, we choose not to additionally release the ac-
tual texts of these copyrighted books. Instead, we
created our dataset using existing datasets and in-
cluded 16 books from BookMIA (Shi et al., 2023),
which are likely in ChatGPT’s training data as sug-
gested by Chang et al. (2023).
For non-literal copying, we identify 118 fictions
in CliffsNotes study guide, where each novel is
associated with a human-written summary.2Fol-
lowing Chang et al. (2023), we exclude non-fiction
books and books whose copyrights have expired
(published prior to 1923), only leaving text sources
that are copyrighted at the time of writing this pa-
per.
3.3 Evaluation Tasks and Metrics
Literal Copying. We follow the evaluation of
literal copying in prior work (Carlini et al., 2023;
Henderson et al., 2023; Meeus et al., 2024). We
construct prompts to ask an LM to complete a pas-
sage given the first 200 words of the source text.
We then compute the ROUGE-L score (Lin, 2004)
between the generated output and the next 50 words
of the source text, which considers the longest com-
mon subsequence between the generation and the
source text. A higher ROUGE-L score indicates a
higher degree of reproduction. Following Huang
et al. (2023), we report the proportion of cases
where the ROUGE-L score is greater than a thresh-
2We used different sources for literal and non-literal copy-
ing because exact snippets are not available in CliffsNotes and
summaries are not available in BookMIA.

old, which is selected to be 0.8 in our study.3
Non-literal Copying. We measure non-literal
copying in the context of creative writing to evalu-
ate the extent to which a generated story is original
with respect to events andcharacters , following
prior court cases. We extract a list of key events and
character names from the CliffsNotes summary of
the book (see Section A.3 for details). We prompt
LMs to generate an original story given the begin-
ning of a story from one of the events in the list.
We extract key events from the source text by
prompting GPT-4 to identify twenty significant
events from a human-written summary. To deter-
mine Event Overlap, we iterate through all events
in the list, employing Flan-T5-XL (Chung et al.,
2024) to assess whether each reference event is
mentioned in the model-generated story (see Sec-
tion A.1 for details). We report the proportion of
instances where event overlap exceeds a threshold
of 5 events.
We extract character’s names (including first
name, last name and aliases) from the summary
3We also considered a semantic similarity based on RET-
Sim (Zhang et al., 2023) and found it highly correlate with
ROUGE-L. We therefore report results with ROUGE-L only.
5because matching characters solely by their full
names often leads to many misses. Character Over-
lap is identified through exact matches of character
names. If any name of a character is recalled, the
character is considered recalled. To prevent ex-
cessive non-literal copying, we exclude characters
whose names appear in the prompt. We report the
proportion of instances where character overlap ex-
ceeds a threshold. For characters, the threshold is
set at 3. For comparison, the average number of
characters in the reference list across books in our
dataset is 9.0.
To demonstrate the evaluation of non-literal
copying, we present an example in Figure 3 with
two stories generated by Llama3-70B and GPT-4-
turbo. The first story appears to reproduce plots
from the Harry Potter book, with three overlapping
events and five overlapping characters identified.
Conversely, the second story is more distinct from
the Harry Potter book, with no overlapping events
or characters identified.
Fact Recall. We evaluate fact recall by the
model’s accuracy in answering questions related to
the source text. Previous research has utilized lan-
guage models to synthesize question-answer pairs
from provided documents, demonstrating high ac-
curacy (Lewis et al., 2021; Namboori et al., 2024).
We construct a QA dataset by prompting GPT-4 to
generate question-answer pairs given the snippet
of the source text. At evaluation, we prompt the
model to answer the question with a short phrase,
and compute the F1 score between the output and
the answer, following Rajpurkar et al. (2016). We
rescale the F1 score to a range of 0-100 for clarity.
Fluency. We evaluate the fluency of the text gen-
erated by the model for the literal and non-literal
copying evaluation. We adopt a five-scale flu-
ency evaluation pipeline based on language model
evaluator, as model-based fluency metrics have
shown to highly align with human evaluations (Liu
et al., 2023; Sottana et al., 2023). Given our need
for large-scale evaluation, we have chosen the
Prometheus-v2 model (Kim et al., 2024) as our
evaluator. This model has demonstrated a high de-
gree of correlation with both GPT-4 and human
evaluations.
Prompt Design. For the literal and non-literal
copying tasks, we use three different prompt tem-
plates for each case to reduce bias introduced by
the prompt. In the fact recall task, the prompt in-structs the model to generate a short answer. To
facilitate a fair comparison between base models
and instruction-tuned models, we incorporate an
instruction and in-context learning demonstrations
into our prompts. Refer to Section A.2 for more
details.
3.4 Human Verification of Automatic
Evaluation
To verify that the automatic metrics align with hu-
man understanding of event and character reproduc-
tion, we conduct a human annotation on a subset
of test cases. We provide the annotators with the
generated story along with a list of events and char-
acters, asking them to identify which of these are
present in the story. Each event or character is
treated as a binary classification problem (included
or not), allowing us to compute accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1 score, as shown in Table 3. The F1
score for event overlap is 0.76, comparable to state-
of-the-art methods on other attribution datasets (Li
et al., 2024b), indicating good performance. The
F1 score for character overlap is 0.96, approaching
the perfect score of 1.0. These human annotation
results demonstrate high accuracy for the automatic
metric.
4 Evaluating Base LMs on C OPYBENCH
We evaluate widely-used pre-trained LMs on
COPYBENCH , and measure the degree of literal,
non-literal copying and fact recall on a list of
copyright-protected fiction books. We aim to un-
derstand how these memorization aspects are cor-
related with each other, and how the scale of the
LMs affect those different aspects.
4.1 Experimental Details
We evaluate a range of open-weight, pre-trained
base models of varying sizes and families: Mistral
7B (Jiang et al., 2023) Mixtral 8x7B (Jiang et al.,
2024), Llama2 7B, 13B, and 70B (Touvron et al.,
2023), and Llama3 8B, 70B (AI@Meta, 2024). We
also evaluate two proprietary models: GPT-4-Turbo
(gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09 ) and GPT-3.5-Turbo
(gpt-35-turbo-0125 ). Proprietary models may
be subject to copyright protection methods and are
not directly comparable to white-box base models,
but we include them for reference.

for reference. Models with fewer than 13 billion parameters can reproduce events and characters, but near-exact
literal copying is rare. For white-box language models, utility increases with model size. However, this also leads to
more frequent instances of both literal and non-literal copying.

no literal copying when the ROUGE-L threshold
is set above 0.8. In contrast, larger models, such
as the Llama3-70B, show a higher proportion of
cases where they can reproduce text from fiction
almost exactly. We observe a skewed distribution
of the ROUGE-L score, as shown in Figure 4. Most
cases exhibit low similarity, while a few cases show
significantly high similarity. This observation mo-
tivates us to report the proportion of cases above a
threshold rather than the average score.
Non-literal Copying. Even among LMs with
near-zero literal copying, we observe a non-
negligible amount of non-literal copying. While
previous studies argue that smaller LMs, such as
those with 7 billion parameters, do not exhibit sig-
nificant copying (Carlini et al., 2023), our results
indicate that even these relatively small models gen-
erate non-literal copying. For example, the Llama3-
8B model shows a 0.1% literal copying score but a
4.5% character copying score. Notably, both event
and character copying scores increase as the model
size grows. Specifically, in the Llama3 model, the
proportion of event copying and character copyingabove the threshold rises from 2.3% to 6.9% and
from 4.5% to 10.3%, respectively, when compar-
ing models from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.
These results suggest that relying solely on literal
copying metrics may overlook potential reproduc-
tions of copyrighted work. Therefore, we should
carefully monitor non-literal copying as well.
Utility. As the model size increases, both fact
recall and fluency improve. The fact recall score
shows a strong correlation with both literal and
non-literal copying scores (Figure 2, Table 2). This
suggests that when a language model memorizes
more factual knowledge from a book, it tends to
reproduce the content in either a literal or non-
literal form. This motivates us to explore ways to
reduce copying while preserving the utility of the
language models (Section 5).
Results of Proprietary LMs. Compared to the
white-box base LMs shown in Table 2, the pro-
prietary models GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have better
trade-offs between reducing copying and improv-
ing model utility. Interestingly, the transition from
GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 significantly reduces literal copy-
ing but increases non-literal copying.
5 Effects of Mitigation Methods
5.1 Training-time Mitigation
Training-time mitigation includes dataset isola-
tion (Min et al., 2023), differential privacy pre-
training (Vyas et al., 2023), post-pretraining align-
ment (Ouyang et al., 2022), and more. In this work,

Table 4: Results of instruction-tuned models on COPYBENCH . Instruction-tuning can reduce copying behavior,
though its effectiveness varies among models. Current open-source instruction-tuned models (e.g., Llama2-Tulu)

we focus on existing model checkpoints trained
with alignment techniques. While the effects of
alignment techniques on downstream tasks and hu-
man preferences are well-studied (Ouyang et al.,
2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023), their
impact on reducing copying behavior remains un-
derexplored. We use COPYBENCH to evaluate var-
ious instruction-tuned LMs.
Models. We evaluate nine instruction-tuned
LMs on baseline models: Llama2-13B,
Llama2-70B (Touvron et al., 2023), Llama3-
70B (AI@Meta, 2024), and Mixtral-8x7B (Jiang
et al., 2024). Some instruction-tuned models
were tuned on proprietary data: Llama2-13B-
Chat, Llama2-70B-Chat, Llama3-70B-Instuct,
and Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct. We also evaluate
open-source instruction models Tulu2-13B and
Tulu2-70B (Ivison et al., 2023), their DPO
versions (Rafailov et al., 2023), and Vicuna-
13B-v1.5 (Zheng et al., 2023). For clarity,
these models are referred to as Llama2-13B-
Tulu(-DPO), Llama2-70B-Tulu(-DPO), and
Llama2-13B-Vicuna.
Results. We report the results of instruction-
tuned models on COPYBENCH Table 4. We ob-
served a general reduction in both literal and
non-literal copying scores across various models,
though the effectiveness varies. Notably, literal
copying consistently decreases, while non-literal
copying can sometimes increase. For example,the Mixtral-8x7B-Instruction model shows a 2.0%
copying rate for events, which is higher than the
1.3% achieved by the Mixtral-8x7B base model.
Generally, instruction-tuned models trained on
proprietary data exhibit the most significant re-
ductions in copying scores. In contrast, the open-
sourced Llama2-70B-Tulu and Llama2-70B-Tulu-
DPO models show a less reduction changes in
both literal and non-literal copying compared with
LLama2-70B-Chat. This highlights the gap in per-
formance between models trained with proprietary
data and those that are open-sourced.
5.2 Inference-time Mitigation
Several inference-time mitigation methods have
been proposed, primarily evaluated on verbatim
copying. We revisit these methods and evaluate
on both verbatim and non-verbatim copying using
COPYBENCH .
Mitigation methods. We focus on two inference-
time mitigation strategies: system-mode self-
reminders (Xie et al., 2023) and MemFree de-
coding (Ippolito et al., 2023). System-mode self-
reminders wrap user queries with system prompts
to remind LMs to be responsible and have been
shown to be effective in defending against jail-
break prompts. In our work, we adopt this idea
and design system prompts to remind LMs to avoid
copying existing literary works. However, previ-
ous research has shown that models can sometimes
disregard system prompts and still produce outputs

Table 5: Comparison of copying and utility with and without system-mode self-reminder (Xie et al., 2023) (shown
as system prompts in the table) and MemFree decoding (Ippolito et al., 2023). We observe that the system-mode
self-reminder does not affect copying behavior, whereas MemFree decoding completely prevents literal copying.
However, neither method effectively reduces non-literal copying. We highlight the percentage in red if the score is
worse and in green if it is better, for cells with more than 10% of changes.
that potentially violate those prompts (Kung and
Peng, 2023; Li et al., 2024a).
We therefore also evaluate a state-of-the-art de-
coding method, MemFree decoding , which pro-
vides strict protection against verbatim copying of
copyrighted content. This method prevents n-gram
copying by rejecting the next token if it forms a
new n-gram copy during decoding. We elaborate
the implementation details in Section B.2.
Models. We evaluate the impact of these mit-
igation methods on four models: Llama2-13B,
Llama2-70B, Llama2-70B-Tulu, and Llama3-70B.
Results. In the system-mode self-reminder
method, we explicitly prompt LMs to avoid copy-
ing from existing copyright-protected works. De-
spite this, the literal and nonliteral copying scores
do not change significantly across all tested LMs.
This pattern is also observed in the instruction-
tuned model Llama-2-70B-Tulu, which is trained
to follow user instructions. We speculate that the
instruction-tuning process fails to teach the model
how to distinguish whether its outputs are copied
from copyright-protected material.
Furthermore, MemFree decoding yields a zero
score for literal copying, effectively preventing
any near-exact reproduction by the baseline model.
This finding aligns with those reported in Ippolito
et al. (2023). However, the scores for non-literal
copying remain relatively unchanged across all
baseline LMs. The generated stories show simi-larities in character names and events, even though
there are no exact phrase or n-gram overlaps. As
such, MemFree decoding does not effectively miti-
gate non-literal copying.
6 Conclusion
This paper introduces a new benchmark, COPY-
BENCH , along with evaluation protocols for both
literal and non-literal copying, as well as utility
measurement. We argue that focusing solely on
literal copying metrics may overlook potential re-
productions of copyrighted work, so non-literal
copying should be carefully monitored. We ob-
serve that while existing instruction-tuned models
can reduce literal copying, some are ineffective at
reducing non-literal copying and may even increase
it. Additionally, we find that current inference-time
mitigation methods, although effective at reducing
literal copying, are insufficient for addressing non-
literal copying. Our findings highlight the need for
open-source research on methods of copyright risk
mitigation and understanding the mechanisms of
them.
No legal conclusions should be drawn from our
experiments. Our methods shed light on ways to
understand overall behavioral properties of LM sys-
tems, and are not suitable for making any specific
assessments of infringement or noninfringement.
Nevertheless, we hope our methods and results
provide empirical data to ground discussions on
copyright issues for language models.
9Limitations
The scope of our current study on copyright risk
evaluation has the following limitations: (1) Com-
prehensiveness of Copying Evaluation - This work
scratches the surface of potential risks, emphasiz-
ing the need for further investigation into LMs’
non-literal copying behaviors. Our evaluation does
not cover the full spectrum of similarity between
model output and copyrighted source, leaving fur-
ther exploration for future research. (2) Scale of the
Dataset - We evaluated 118 books for non-literal
copying and 16 books for literal copying. This
scale is comparable to recent studies (Meeus et al.,
2024; Henderson et al., 2023), but it is limited by
the difficulty of accessing the full texts of copyright-
protected books and the need to avoid extensively
releasing snippets when publishing the benchmark.
We expect that data holders can apply the evalua-
tion protocols introduced in our research to a larger
scale evaluation. (3) Domains and Languages - Our
current evaluation is limited to English fictional
books. We leave the exploration of other domains
and languages for future work. (4) US-Centric
Copyright Practice - Our discussion on copyright
infringement focuses on the US fair use doctrine
and related court cases. However, copyright prac-
tices vary across different countries and regions,
necessitating further research to understand these
differences.
Ethical Considerations
(1)No Malicious Intent - Our study aims to as-
sess the reproduction of copyright-protected text
by language models solely for research purposes,
not to advocate for copyright infringement. The
designed prompts are intended for auditing LMs
to ensure their responsible use, with no malicious
intent, helping to protect the rights of content cre-
ators and promote ethical AI use. (2) Not Dis-
tributing Copyrighted Data - We ensure all the data
we created is either based on existing public data
on the Internet or is a sufficiently transformative
use of copyrighted data. (3) Not Making Legal
Claims - We do not draw any legal conclusions in
our work. Instead, we provide an automatic evalua-
tion to ground discussions on copyright issues.

13A Details of CopyBench
A.1 Source Data Collection
Extracting Events and Characters for Non-
literal copying. We use the first five events in the
event list as the story beginning. We extract events
and characters from human-written summary on
CliffNotes study guide using GPT-4 ( gpt-4-0613 ).
The prompts are provided in Figure 13 and Fig-
ure 14.
Synthesizing QA Pairs for Fact Recall Evalua-
tion. To synthesize question-answer pairs based
on a snippet from fictional books, we follow the
three steps. First, input the passage into GPT-
4 (gpt-4-0613 ) and prompt it to generate rele-
vant question-answer (QA) pairs Figure 10. Next,
identify the underlying claim of each QA pair
by prompting GPT-4 Figure 11. Finally, we fil-
ter incorrect QA pairs by prompting GPT-4 to
verify whether the the passage fully supports
the claim Figure 12. This process ensures each
question-answer pair is both relevant and accurate.
A.2 Prompt Design in C OPYBENCH
For the evaluation, we use the same prompt tem-
plate for both the pre-trained base model and the
instruction-tuned models. To guide the instruction-
tuned models, it is necessary to include detailed
instructions about the task and the desired output.
To guide the pre-trained base model, it is helpful
to use a few-shot in-context learning to align it
with our intent during the evaluation. We use four
demonstrations for all tasks. The prompt templates
are shown in Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7.
For system-mode self-reminder, we design a sys-
tem prompts " You should be a responsible
agent and should not copy content from
copyright-protected works in any form or
violate copyright law. " For instruction-tuned
models that support system prompt, we place the
system prompt into the chat template of the model.
Otherwise, we simply prepend the system prompt
to the instruction.
A.3 Metrics Design
Event Overlap. We utilize Flan-T5-XL (Chung
et al., 2024) as the attribution model to assess
the inclusion of each reference event in the gen-
erated story. Flan-T5-XL is shown to achieve near
state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot attribu-
tion tasks according to Bohnet et al. (2023). Weadhere to their evaluation prompts as depicted in
Figure 8. Due to the limited context length of Flan-
T5-XL, we divide the story into segments of 128
tokens each. If any segment contains a reference
event, we consider the event to be included in the
story.
Fluency. We use Prometheus-v2 (Kim et al.,
2024) as the evaluator to assess the fluency of the
LM generation in both literal and non-literal eval-
uation. As shown by Kim et al. (2024), the model
has a high agreement with both human raters and
GPT-4. We developed a five-point rubric based on
Fu et al. (2023), as shown in Figure 9.
A.4 Human Evaluation for Automatic Event
Copying Evaluation
We evaluate the consistency between automatic
event overlap detection and human judgment on
outputs from three models: Llama2-70B, Llama2-
70B-Chat, and Llama2-70B-Tulu. Our goal is to
ensure comprehensive coverage of various levels
of similarity between the generated stories and the
original works. To achieve this, we selected 10 sam-
ples for each value of the automatic event overlap
score. In cases where fewer than 10 samples were
available for a given score, we used all available
samples. This resulted in a total of 82 cases.
The annotators are asked to read the LM-
generated story and decide whether each provided
reference event and character is entailed in the story.
The instruction is shown in Table 11. We then re-
ported the accuracy, recall and precision of the
automatic event detection model.
B Details of Experiments
B.1 Parameters for LM Generation
For all experiments, we use greedy sampling and
set the repetition penalty to 1.1. The repetition
penalty helps prevent smaller models from generat-
ing a large amount of repetitive text in both literal
and non-literal copying evaluations. All language
model generations are run with float16 precision.
For the creative writing tasks in the non-literal eval-
uation, we limit the generation length to a maxi-
mum of 1024 tokens.
B.2 MemFree Decoding Implementation
MemFree decoding was initially developed to de-
tect copying from the pre-training corpus. How-
ever, detecting overlap with a large-scale corpus
is computationally expensive. To address this, we
14collect the corpus to reject using the original text of
fictional books. Specifically, we use the collection
of all reference texts for literal copying evaluation.
For non-literal copying, we extract the original text
of fictional books from the Pile (Gao et al., 2020)
datasets within our book list. This setup is more
computationally efficient than the original version
in our setting while maintaining similar protection.
C Additional Results
C.1 Skewed Distribution of Similarity Metrics
Figure 4 shows the histograms for Rouge-L, Events
Overlap, and Characters Overlap across three lan-
guage models (LMs). These scores are generally
low in most cases, indicating minimal similarity
between the LM outputs and the copyrighted works.
However, the long tail of the distribution reveals
instances of high similarity. This observation sug-
gests that the tail of the distribution is more related
to the copying behavior than the average scores.
Consequently, we define the copying metrics as
the proportion of test cases with Rouge-L, Events
Overlap, and Characters Overlap above a certain
threshold.
C.2 Case Study
Literal Copying. In addition to ROUGE-L, we
considered RETSim (Zhang et al., 2023), a text
similarity metric that focuses on capturing near-
exact similarities as a measure of literal copying.
In Table 6, we present five examples of language
model (LM) outputs alongside their references,
each exhibiting varying degrees of literal similarity.
ROUGE-L and RETSim highly consistent on these
examples.
Non-literal Copying. As an illustration, we refer
to Harper Lee’s novel To Kill a Mockingbird (1960).
Table 7 displays the events and characters extracted
from this novel in COPYBENCH . Furthermore, Ta-
ble 8 shows three examples of LM-generated sto-
ries, along with their event and character overlaps
calculated with our non-literal copying protocol.
Fact Recall. We present ten randomly sampled
question and answer pairs based on Harry Pot-
ter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (1997) from COPY-
BENCH . Additionally, we demonstrate the output
of the Llama3-70B model along with its QA F1
score.

Atticus Finch,
Scout’s father,
is appointed to
defend Tom Robin-
son, a black man
accused of raping a
white woman.[...]Atticus agrees to defend Tom [3] because he believes in justice
and equality. Scout, who is only six years old at the beginning of the
novel, is initially unaware of the racial tensions in her town. [...] As the
trial approaches, the town becomes increasingly hostile towards Atticus
and his family. Some people in the town are angry that Atticus is
defending a black man, and they believe that he is betraying his
race [9]. Despite the threats and insults, Atticus remains committed to
defending Tom and upholding justice. During the trial, Atticus presents
a strong case in Tom’s defense, but the all-white jury still finds Tom
guilty [12]. Atticus is disappointed but not surprised by the verdict,
and he continues to fight for Tom’s rights even after the trial is over.
In the end, Tom is killed while trying to escape from prison [14],
and Atticus is devastated by the injustice of it all. Despite the tragedy,
Atticus remains committed to fighting for justice and equality, and he
teaches his children to do the same.4 0

Somehow, it was hotter then. [...] I remember my father, Atticus (3)
Finch, reading the newspaper on the porch. He would always read the
paper, and then fold it up and place it on the table. He would then
proceed to light his pipe, and smoke it while he watched the street. I
remember the summer days, when my brother Jem(2) and I would play
outside. We would run around the yard, and play games like tag and
hide-and-seek. [...] That summer, we met Dill(6). Dill was a boy who
lived in the neighborhood for a few months every summer. [...] My
father was defending a black man named Tom (7)Robinson, who
was accused of raping a white woman [3]. It was a controversial case,
and the town was divided. [...] We learned about friendship, loyalty,
and courage. And we learned about the importance of standing up for
what is right, even if it is not easy.1 4

Table 8: Three stories generated by Llama2-70B and Llama2-70B-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023), using the novel
To Kill a Mockingbird (1960) as reference, evaluated using our non-literal copying protocol. We have manually
highlighted the overlapped events in bold and referenced their indices from the list of reference event Table 7.
Similarly, overlapped characters are underlined with their indices. We observe that stories with higher overlaps in
events and characters tend to resemble the plot of the copyrighted book more closely, whereas stories with lower
overlaps are likely to be more original. Please note that the character overlap does not include characters from the
