Abstract
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) offers
interpretable semantic components of embed-
dings. While ICA theory assumes that em-
beddings can be linearly decomposed into in-
dependent components, real-world data often
do not satisfy this assumption. Consequently,
non-independencies remain between the esti-
mated components, which ICA cannot elimi-
nate. We quantified these non-independencies
using higher-order correlations and demon-
strated that when the higher-order correlation
between two components is large, it indicates
a strong semantic association between them,
along with many words sharing common mean-
ings with both components. The entire struc-
ture of non-independencies was visualized us-
ing a maximum spanning tree of semantic com-
ponents. These findings provide deeper insights
into embeddings through ICA.
1 Introduction
Embeddings play an important role in natural
language processing, ranging from word embed-
dings (Mikolov et al., 2013) to internal represen-
tations in language models (Devlin et al., 2019;
Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023). Under-
standing how embeddings represent meaning is
crucial for unraveling black box NLP models.
Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
(Hyvärinen and Oja, 2000) is an effective method
for visualizing and interpreting the geometric
structure of embeddings (Musil and Mare ˇcek,
2024; Yamagiwa et al., 2023). Just as PCA aims
to make coordinate axes uncorrelated, ICA seeks
to transform the coordinate axes into statistically
independent components. The resulting axes from
ICA tend to have sparser component values with
a few larger values compared to PCA, which
increases interpretability as the axes can be seen as
specific semantic components (Fig. 1).
However it has been pointed out that the esti-
mated ‘independent components’ are only approxi-
Figure 1: Heatmap visualization of 300-dimensional
SGNS embeddings transformed by PCA and ICA, with
axes sorted by variance and skewness, respectively.
Each embedding has been normalized to have a norm
of 1 for better visual interpretation. For each axis, the
top 4 words (frequency nw≥100in text8) with largest
component values were used. The first 100 axes are
displayed in the top panels, and the first 5 axes with
the word labels are displayed in the bottom panels. See
Appendices A, B and G for details.
mately independent (Hyvärinen et al., 2001; Sasaki
et al., 2013, 2014). This is because many real-
world datasets cannot be accurately represented as
a linear combination of independent components,
contradicting the assumption of ICA theory.
In this study, we aim to further interpret the
results of applying ICA to embeddings by focus-
ing on the non-independence between ‘indepen-
dent components’. We measure the degree of non-
independence by calculating higher-order correla-
tions between components and find that compo-
nents with large higher-order correlations can be
interpreted as having strong semantic associations.
The entire structure is revealed by visualizing the
maximum spanning tree of semantic components
with higher-order correlations as edge weights.arXiv:2409.19919v2  [cs.CL]  9 Oct 20242Review: ICA-Transformed Embeddings
Procedure of ICA. For a centered embedding
matrix X∈Rn×dthat represents the meanings of
nwords by d-dimensional vectors, ICA1seeks a
transformation S=XB such that each compo-
nentS1,···, Sdof the transformed matrix S=
[S1,···, Sd]is as statistically independent as pos-
sible2. The transformation Bcan be expressed as
the product of the whitening transformation matrix
A(e.g., PCA transformation) and the orthogonal
transformation matrix Rica, i.e., the resulting Sis
represented as
S=XAR ica. (1)
Here, Ricais obtained by minimizing the mu-
tual information3I(S1···Sd) =PH(Si)−
H(S1···Sd), which is equivalent to maximiz-
ing the non-gaussianity4of the distributions of
Si(Hyvärinen and Oja, 2000). The normalized
ICA-transformed embeddings, with each embed-
ding in Srescaled to a norm of 1, offer high inter-
pretability (Yamagiwa et al., 2023, 2024) and are
used for visualizations in this paper.
Figure 2: Scatterplots of normalized word embeddings
along the 10th and 20th axes. The axes for PCA and
ICA-transformed embeddings were arranged in descend-
ing order of variance and skewness, respectively. In both
transformations, the components are uncorrelated.
Comparison of PCA and ICA. Figure 2 shows
that ICA can find the ‘spiky and interpretable shape’
of the embedding distribution (e.g., “biology” and
“stars” for the 10th and 20th axes, respectively), but
PCA cannot. This is because ICA determines the
coordinate axes toward high non-gaussianity, while
PCA only considers variance information.
1For the computation, FastICA (Hyvärinen, 1999) imple-
mented in scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) is used.

4The degree to which a probability distribution deviates
from a Gaussian distribution can be measured using statistics
based on higher-order moments, such as skewness (the third
moment) or the negentropy of the distribution.3 Higher-Order Correlations Among
Estimated Independent Components
Non-Independence in Real-World Data. The
‘independent components’ estimated by ICA on
real-world data are uncorrelated but not completely
independent, with dependencies existing between
components (Hyvärinen et al., 2001; Sasaki et al.,
2013, 2014). This is because ICA assumes a linear
decomposition into independent components, an
assumption frequently violated in reality.
Higher-Order Correlation. To quantify non-
independencies, methods like mutual informa-
tion and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion
(HSIC) (Gretton et al., 2005) exist. Here we use
the higher-order correlation, the simplest measure
in terms of computation and formulation. This
measure is expressed as follows:
E(S2
iS2
j) =1
nnX
t=1S2
t,iS2
t,j. (2)
Here,Sis the whitened matrix5. This can also be
interpreted as the covariance between S2
iandS2
j,
plus one, as cov(S2
i, S2
j) = E(( S2
i−1)(S2
j−1)) =
E(S2
iS2
j)−1. IfSiandSjare independent of each
other, then E(S2
iS2
j) = E( S2
i)E(S2
j) = 1 . Thus,
the deviation of E(S2
iS2
j)from 1is the degree of
dependence between SiandSj.
Figure 3: Heatmaps of the correlation coefficient
E(SiSj)and the higher-order correlation E(S2
iS2
j)of
component pairs (Si, Sj)from ICA on 300-dimensional
SGNS embeddings. See Appendix C for details.
Figure 3 shows that the estimated independent
components of the embeddings are uncorrelated but
not completely independent, with varying degrees
of higher-order correlations across pairs. These
E(S2
iS2
j)values provide a useful metric of associa-
tion, as demonstrated in the following section.
5The components are (i) centered: E(Si) = 0 , the mean
of each component is 0, (ii) scaled: E(S2
i) = 1 , the variance
of each component is 1, and (iii) uncorrelated: E(SiSj) = 0 ,
the correlations are all zero.

4 Interpretation of Higher-Order
Correlations as Semantic Relevance
4.1 Degree of Semantic Relevance
We show that the values of higher-order correla-
tions E(S2
iS2
j)can be interpreted as the degree of
associations between semantic components.
Results: Top Row of Table 1. The meanings of
each component, represented by the listed words
in component pairs with high E(S2
iS2
j)values, are
strongly related. For example, focusing on Axis
0and Axis 82, a pair with particularly large val-
ues of E(S2
iS2
j), we can interpret that Axis 0has
a meaning associated with “dishes” and Axis 82
with “beer”, suggesting that there is a semantic
relationship between them.
Results: Bottom Row of Table 1. On the other
hand, for component pairs with E(S2
iS2
j)values
close to 1, indicating that the components are con-
sidered independent, there is no clear relevance
between the meanings of the components. For ex-
ample, looking at the pair of Axis 0and Axis 23,
which has a small E(S2
iS2
j)value, we can interpret
that Axis 0represents “dishes” and Axis 23repre-
sents “polymath”, and there is no direct semantic
relationship between them.
Detailed results are shown in Appendix G.4.2 Quantitative Evaluation via GPT-4o mini
We conducted experiments to quantitatively evalu-
ate whether higher-order correlations between ICA
components represent semantic relationships.
Settings. Our experimental procedure was as fol-
lows. We first selected the top 100 ICA compo-
nents, ranked by skewness. For each component i
(i= 0, . . . , 99), we created three word lists: Word
list-1 comprised the top 5 words from component
i, Word list-2 contained the top 5 words from the
k-th most correlated component with component i
(k= 1, . . . , 5), and Word list-3 consisted of the top
5 words from a randomly selected low-correlation
component (chosen from the bottom 30% of cor-
related components). Using these lists, we gen-
erated pairs (list-1, list-2) and (list-1, list-3), and
queried GPT-4o mini to determine which pair was
more semantically related6. This procedure was
executed for all 100 components, resulting in 200
total comparisons for each value of kfrom 1 to 5.
The specific prompt used for GPT-4o mini model
is provided in Appendix D.
Results and Discussion. Table 2 shows the re-
sult of the experiment. We can see that component
pairs with higher-order correlations tend to be more
semantically related (69.0% for k= 1vs 27.0% for
bottom 30%), and that semantic relatedness grad-
ually declines as correlation decreases (69.0% at
k= 1 to 56.5% at k= 5). These results quanti-
tatively demonstrate that higher-order correlations
between ICA components effectively reflect seman-
tic relatedness between corresponding words.
6To mitigate potential biases, we randomly shuffled the
order of the lists in the pairs and repeated this process with
the reversed order: (list-1, list-3) and (list-1, list-2).

Results. Table 3 presents component pairs se-
lected from the maximum spanning tree T150
(Sec. 5) and words significantly contributing to
their E(S2
iS2
j)values. These words often relate to
the meanings of both components, demonstrating
additive compositionality. For example, in the Axis
10 and Axis 2 pair, words like ribose ,deoxyribose ,
phosphodiester ,biosynthesis ,methyltransferase ,
andpyrimidine notably contribute to the E(S2
iS2
j)
value, linking biomolecules and chemical compo-
nents. Detailed results are shown in Appendix G.
Visualization. Figure 4 shows word embedding
scatter plots for axis pairs (10, 2) and (27, 64) with
large higher-order correlations to illustrate the dis-
tribution of words with significant contributionsto higher-order correlations. Unlike a typical in-
dependent component scatter plot (Fig. 2), these
exhibit many words with large component values in
both axes, reflecting the meanings of both axes and
demonstrating the additive compositionality of em-
beddings. For the (10, 2) pair, words that notably
contribute to the E(S2
iS2
j)(ribose ,deoxyribose ,
phosphodiester ,biosynthesis ,methyltransferase ,
andpyrimidine ) appear with significant values in
both components. This abundance of words shar-
ing both semantic components is characteristic of
pairs with large higher-order correlations. Detailed
results are shown in Appendix C.
5 Visualization of Non-Independence
Structure
In this section, we construct a maximum spanning
tree (MST) based on higher-order correlations to
visualize the non-independence between estimated
independent components.
Settings. The 300 ICA components, originally
ordered by skewness with i= 0,···,299, were re-
sorted in descending order of semantic component
consistency scores to prioritize axes that are more
easily interpretable as specific semantic compo-
nents. The semantic component consistency scores
were determined by a word intrusion task (Chang
et al., 2009). A higher consistency score indicates
easier interpretability. Details of the scoring meth-
ods are provided in Appendix E.1. We introduce
the notation σto map the order of consistency
scores to the original axis numbers in the skew-
ness order: σ(j)represents the axis number in the
skewness sort for the axis with the j-th highest
consistency score. Then, we consider a weighted
complete graph G150, with 150 components having
high consistency scores Sσ(i)(i∈0,···,149) as
nodes. For the edge between the node pair (Si, Sj),

component value along axis kamong words with frequency nw≥100in the text8 corpus. The color of the edge
between nodes (i, j)represents the magnitude of the E(S2
iS2
j)value between the components, with darker edge
colors indicating larger values.
we set cij= E( S2
iS2
j)as the weight. To visual-
ize and interpret G150, we compute the maximum
spanning tree (MST)7T150, a spanning tree that
maximizes the sum of cijin the graph G150. MST
was relatively more interpretable than other sub-
graphs of graph G150, providing a good balance
between visibility and element relationships.
Interpretation of the MST. The MST T150
represents a graph structure expressing the non-
independence between estimated independent com-
ponents. Since the edges in T150connect compo-
nent pairs with large higher-order correlations, we
can interpret that there is a strong relationship be-
tween the components connected by these edges.
Furthermore, the subtrees of T150represent groups
of semantically related components, and the com-
ponents within these groups tend to have similar
meanings.
Results and Discussion. Figure 5 shows a part
of the MST T150; the entire MST T150is exhib-
ited in Appendix E.2. The colors correspond to
the clusters obtained by applying spectral cluster-
ing8(Ng et al., 2001) to T150. The weights used for
clustering are the higher-order correlations. From
7We used minimum_spanning_tree implemented in
NetworkX (Hagberg et al., 2008) for the computation of the
MST. See Appendix E.2 for details.
8We used SpectralClustering implemented in
scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011).the MST, we can infer structures such as connec-
tions and groupings of meanings among three or
more components9. For example, semantically re-
lated component pairs such as ( 2: dna, 10: acid )
in the pink cluster and ( 27: greek, 64: goddess )
in the cyan cluster are connected by edges in T150.
Additionally, groups such as {168: license, 13:
windows, 56: cpu }in the yellow cluster and {46:
spacecraft, 35: aircraft, 47: ship }in the blue clus-
ter form semantic clusters as sets of nodes con-
nected by edges. The components within these
groups can be interpreted as having meanings re-
lated to “computer” and “vehicle”, respectively.
6 Conclusion
Both ICA and PCA transformations make the com-
ponents uncorrelated. ICA goes further by mak-
ing the components nearly independent, but some
non-independence still remains. In this study, we
used higher-order correlations to quantify the non-
independence between the components in the ICA-
transformed word embeddings. By interpreting
these as the semantic associations between the com-
ponents and visualizing the overall structure, we
can gain a deeper understanding of the latent se-
mantic structure within the embeddings.
9Furthermore, in Appendix F, we conducted a dimension-
ality reduction experiment that numerically demonstrates how
the MST effectively represents a significant structure among
the components.
5Limitations
•The embeddings used in the experiments are
limited to SGNS word embeddings. For a
more thorough analysis, it is necessary to con-
duct experiments using various types of em-
beddings.
•For large embedding matrices with a high
number of data points n, ICA may fail to
converge within a practical timeframe. To
overcome this, we suggest using subsampled
data to estimate the ICA transformation ma-
trix, which can then be applied to unseen em-
bedding vectors.
•When nis large, calculating higher-order cor-
relations (eq. 2) may become computationally
intensive. This calculation is similar to the
computation of the variance-covariance ma-
trix and can be approximated by subsampling
data points. Further speedup can be achieved
by parallelization of the computation.
•Since ICA leverages the non-Gaussianity of
embedding distributions, it is not suitable for
analysis if the original embeddings follow a
multivariate Gaussian distribution.

Axis57shows a particularly high correlation coefficient.
An interesting vertical streak is observed in Axis
57of the heatmap for ICA-transformed embed-
dings in Fig. 1. This streak can be explained by
several factors. As shown in Fig. 6, Axis 57ex-
hibits a strong correlation between component val-
ues and word frequencies nw, suggesting that Axis
57 is more associated with word frequency than
with a specific semantic meaning. Additionally,
the words used in Fig. 1 were selected from those
appearing more than 100 times in the text8 cor-
pus, resulting in a bias towards high-frequency

the component values of the 57th axis of the ICA-
transformed embeddings. Words used in Fig. 1 are
highlighted in dark blue. The regression line and coeffi-
cient of determination were calculated for words with a
frequency of nw≥10.

words. This tendency is further illustrated in Fig. 7,
which demonstrates that words used in the heatmap
(nw≥100) tend to have larger component values
along Axis 57. In contrast, Fig. 8 shows that for
axes with weak correlation to word frequency, the
words used in the heatmap do not exhibit notably
large component values. Consequently, large com-
ponent values were observed along Axis 57 in the
heatmap, a pattern that was unique to Axis 57 and
not observed in other axes.

tively. While there are component pairs where
E(S2
iS2
j)<1, in Fig. 3, the range of values was
truncated between 1.0and2.5for visualization pur-
poses.
C.2 Scatterplots for Independent Axes
Complementary Results for Sec. 4.3. Table 3
in Sec. 4.3 presented words with significant con-
tributions to higher-order correlations for six axis
pairs. While the main text illustrated the distri-
bution of these highly contributing words through
scatter plots for the two selected pairs, Figure 10
provides scatter plots for all the six pairs.
The Relationship Between the Magnitude of
Higher-Order Correlations and the Appearance
of Scatter Plots. Figure 11 presents the scatter
plots of word embeddings for 24 component pairs,
each with different higher-order correlation val-
ues. We can see that as the magnitude of higher-
order correlation increases, the number of words
with large component values along both axes in-
creases as well. The selection of these 24 pairs was
conducted as follows: First, we considered 150
components Sσ(0),···, Sσ(149) with high semantic
consistency (see Appendix E.1 for the calculation
method). We then sorted all possible component
pairs (Si, Sj) (i, j∈σ(0),···, σ(149)) based on
the value of |E(S2
iS2
j)−1|. We established 24
equally spaced grids between the minimum and
maximum values, and selected pairs closest to each
grid point without repetition.
Words with Significant Contributions to Higher-
Order Correlations. We have observed words
with significant contributions, i.e., with large values
ofS2
t,iS2
t,j, to higher-order correlations E(S2
iS2
j)
in Table 3 in Sec. 4.3, and will see further exam-
ples in Tables 8 and 9 in Appendix G. Such words
are labeled in red in the scatter plots in Fig. 4 in
Section 4.3, as well as in Figs. 10 and 11 in Ap-
pendix C.2. For axis pairs with large higher-order
correlations, we observe a large number of words
that make significant contributions to the higher-
order correlations. The meanings of these words
include both axes’ meanings, demonstrating the
additive compositionality of embeddings.

Question :
You are given 2 list pairs (A, B), (C, D).
If one pair is more semantically relevant than
the other , answer the pair .
If you cannot determine , answer "XX ".
List pair (A, B): ({ wordlist_1 }, { wordlist_2 })
List pair (C, D): ({ wordlist_1 }, { wordlist_3 })
Output :
"AB" if (A, B) is more semantically related
"CD" if (C, D) is more semantically related
"XX" if equally related , or you can 't decide
Respond with only AB , CD , or XX.
When conducting the experiment, we took the
following steps to eliminate any potential biases
arising from the order of word sequences and spe-
cific label names.
1.To remove the influence of word order within
lists, we randomly shuffled the words in
wordlist_1 ,wordlist_2 , and wordlist_3 .
2.To prevent bias in output labels, we conducted
the experiment twice, swapping wordlist_2
andwordlist_3 between runs.3.To account for order bias in the prompt, we
randomly alternated the order of the following
two lines:
List pair (A, B): ({ wordlist_1 }, { wordlist_2 })
List pair (C, D): ({ wordlist_1 }, { wordlist_3 })
E Details of Visualization of
Non-Independence Structure
E.1 Scoring ICA Axes: Word Intrusion Task
We assigned a semantic coherence score to each
axis of the ICA-transformed embeddings using the
word intrusion task method (Chang et al., 2009).
Word Intrusion Task. The word intrusion task is
a method used to evaluate the semantic coherence
of a set of kwords by assessing the ability to iden-
tify an intruder word. For instance, consider the
set of words {windows, os, unix, linux, microsoft },
which has a consistent theme of operating systems.
In this case, an unrelated word such as waterskiing
should be easily identifiable as an intruder, as it
does not align with the theme of operating systems.
In our experiment, we assigned coherence scores
to the top k= 5words (with frequency nw≥100
in the text8 corpus) for each axis.
Selection of the Intruder Word. In order to se-
lect the intruder word for the set of top kwords
of each axis a∈ {1, . . . , d }, denoted as topk(a),
we randomly chose a word from a pool of words
that satisfy both of the following criteria simulta-
neously: (i) the word ranks in the lower 50% in
terms of the component value on the axis a, and
(ii) it ranks in the top 10% in terms of the compo-
nent value on some axis other than a. For each axis,
L= 100 intruder words are randomly selected, and
Wint(a)denotes the set of these Lintruder words.
9Scoring Method. For the consistency score of
the meaning of each axis a,Score( a), we adopted
the metric proposed by Sun et al. (2016).
Score( a) =InterDist( a)
IntraDist( a)
IntraDist( a) =X
wi,wj∈topk(a)
wi̸=wjdist(wi, wj)
k(k−1)
InterDist( a) = mean
w∈Wint(a)X
wi∈topk(a)dist(wi, w)
k
In this formula, we defined dist(wi, wj) =∥si−
sj∥for the ICA-transformed embeddings. Here,
IntraDist( a)denotes the average distance between
the top kwords, and InterDist( a)represents the
average distance between the top words and the in-
truder words. The score is higher when the intruder
words are further away from the set topk(a). There-
fore, this score serves as a quantitative measure of
the ability to identify the intruder word, thus it is
used as a measure of the consistency of the mean-
ing of the top kwords and the interpretability of
axes.
E.2 Entire Visualization of MST
Figure 12 is the visualization of maximum span-
ning tree (MST) T150defined in Sec. 5. For a graph
G150, where the cost between nodes iandjdefined
ascij=E(S2
iS2
j), the algorithm to find the MST
Tis a greedy method that maximizes the total sum
of costs,P
(i,j)∈Tcij, subject to Tbeing a span-
ning tree. The greedy algorithm selects edges in
decreasing order of cijwhile adhering to the tree
constraint. Due to the monotonicity of f(x) = 1/x,
the decreasing order of cijis equivalent to the in-
creasing order of 1/cij. Thus, computing the MST
T150in the graph G150is equivalent to finding the
minimum spanning tree, which minimizes the sum
of1/cij.

Table 5: Word similarity scores for dimensionality re-
duction.
We experimentally confirmed that the structure
of higher-order correlations between componentscan be applied to the dimensionality reduction of
embeddings. Specifically, we performed Spectral
Clustering on the maximum Spanning Tree (MST)
T300, which was computed based on the higher-
order correlations between components. By reduc-
ing the dimensionality of the embeddings through
averaging the clustered axes, we verified that the
accuracy degradation in Word Similarity Tasks was
mitigated compared to random clustering.
Experimental Settings. We conducted our ex-
periments using the 300-dimensional word embed-
dings (SGNS). These embeddings were subjected
to PCA and ICA to obtain components for cluster-
ing. We employed two clustering methods: (1) Ran-
dom Clustering and (2) Spectral Clustering on the
maximum Spanning Tree (MST) T300, which was
computed based on the higher-order correlations
calculated using Eq. 2. Clustering was performed
with the number of clusters ranging from 2 to 100.
Dimensionality reduction was achieved by averag-
ing the clustered axes, resulting in reduced dimen-
sions from d= 2tod= 100 . The performance of
the lower-dimensional embeddings was evaluated
through Word Similarity Tasks. For the Word Sim-
ilarity Tasks, we utilized six datasets: MEN (Bruni
et al., 2014), WS353 (Finkelstein et al., 2002),
MTurk (Radinsky et al., 2011), RW (Luong et al.,
2013), SimLex999 (Hill et al., 2015), and SimVerb-
3500 (Gerz et al., 2016). Each dataset comprises
word pairs along with gold similarity scores, as-
signed by human annotators. We employed the
Spearman rank correlation coefficient between hu-
man ratings and the cosine similarity of the word
embeddings as the evaluation metric. The reported
values represent the average scores across the six
datasets.
Results and Discussion The experimental results
are presented in Table 5. We observe that ICA-
based methods outperform PCA-based methods.
Moreover, our proposed method, Spectral Cluster-
ing on the MST of ICA components, consistently
achieves the best performance across all dimen-
sions. This can be attributed to the fact that com-
ponents included in the same cluster on the MST
likely have high semantic relevance and play sim-
ilar roles in representing the meaning of words.
These results validate that considering higher-order
correlations between axes better preserves seman-
tic relationships in compressed word embeddings,
demonstrating the practical utility of our method. It
is important to note that this evaluation assesses the
10performance of clustering using a downstream task
of dimensionality reduction, rather than dimension-
ality reduction itself.
