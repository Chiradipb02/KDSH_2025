Abstract
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has
emerged as a prominent algorithm for the di-
rect and robust alignment of Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, of-
fering a more straightforward alternative to
the complex Reinforcement Learning from Hu-
man Feedback (RLHF). Despite its promis-
ing efficacy, DPO faces a notable drawback:
“verbosity ”, a common over-optimization phe-
nomenon also observed in RLHF. While pre-
vious studies mainly attributed verbosity to bi-
ased labels within the data, we propose that
the issue also stems from an inherent algorith-
mic length reliance in DPO. Specifically, we
suggest that the discrepancy between sequence-
level Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergences be-
tween chosen and rejected sequences, used
in DPO, results in overestimated or underes-
timated rewards due to varying token lengths.
Empirically, we utilize datasets with different
label lengths to demonstrate the presence of
biased rewards. We then introduce an effec-
tive downsampling approach, named SamPO,
to eliminate potential length reliance. Our ex-
perimental evaluations, conducted across three
LLMs of varying scales and a diverse array of
conditional and open-ended benchmarks, high-
light the efficacy of SamPO in mitigating ver-
bosity, achieving improvements of 5% to 12%
over DPO through debaised rewards1.
1 Introduction
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) is a crucial strategy for effectively align
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
minds (Zhao et al., 2023a; Yang et al., 2023; Pan
et al., 2023b), showcasing significant improve-
ments of LLM’s instruct-following capability com-
pared with the other two popular approaches: pre-
training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In fact, a

final stage of their entire training pipelines (Ouyang
et al., 2022; Achiam et al., 2023; Bi et al., 2024).
Nevertheless, traditional RLHF involves sev-
eral intricate multi-stage steps, typically starting
with fine-tuning a reward model that captures
complex human intuition (Bai et al., 2022), fol-
lowed by optimizing LLMs to maximize prefer-
ence scores. Therefore, the quality of the reward
model is crucial. However, modeling elusive hu-
man intuition is inherently difficult (Wang et al.,
2024). On the contrary, Direct Preference Opti-
mization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) proposed
to re-parameterize the reward model, integrating
preference feedback from online rewards into of-
fline labels. In specific, DPO employs the Bradley-
Terry model (Bradley and Terry, 1952) to maxi-
mize implicit rewards via pairwise offline pref-
erence labels. The implicit reward is mathemat-
ically equivalent to the discrepancy in sequence-
level Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergences (Kullback
and Leibler, 1951) between chosen and rejected
labels. The KL divergence for each label is calcu-
lated based on probability outputs from the fine-
tuning policy model and a frozen reference model.
DPO eliminates the need for complex prefix fine-
tuning of an external reward model, while main-
tains performance comparable to RLHF (Dubois
et al., 2024b; Hou et al., 2024).
Despite its effectiveness, DPO faces several
notable challenges, including issues of overfit-
ting (Azar et al., 2023; Jung et al., 2024), high
computational costs (Ethayarajh et al., 2024; Hong
et al., 2024), and verbosity (Hou et al., 2024; Park
et al., 2024). This paper specifically focuses on
addressing the “ verbosity ” issue.
Traditional multi-stage RLHF methods argue
that due to a statistical bias in length distribution,
that is, where preferred labels tend to be longer
than rejected preference labels (Singhal et al., 2023;
Park et al., 2024), the reward model trained onarXiv:2406.10957v4  [cs.CL]  9 Dec 2024Figure 1: Down-Sampling strategy helps mitigate the potential length reliance, and thus improves DPO.
such preference data inherently exhibit a length
bias (Shen et al., 2023). Therefore, subsequent fine-
tuned policy model exploit this bias as a shortcut to
achieve higher reward scores by generating longer
responses (Gao et al., 2023a), without necessarily
improving quality (Kabir et al., 2023; Dubois et al.,
2024b). Various regularization approaches have
been proposed to mitigate this inherent bias within
reward models (Ramamurthy et al., 2022; Coste
et al., 2023; Moskovitz et al., 2023; Chen et al.,
2024b). On the other hand, although DPO does not
explicitly use a reward model, the length distribu-
tion bias inherent in the offline preference labels
still contributes to the verbosity issue (Hou et al.,
2024; Rafailov et al., 2024). Analysis suggests that
policy models trained using DPO tend to generate
responses that are almost twice the length of the
labeled data (Park et al., 2024).
In this paper, we propose that, in addition to
the length bias in the data, DPO exhibits a hidden
algorithmic dependence on response length. As
illustrated in the upper portion of Figure 1, the loss
function in DPO is based on the discrepancy be-
tween sequence-level KL divergence, which can
also be computed and aggregated at the token-level.
It is evident that discrepancies between chosen la-
belywand rejected label yllead to an inadver-
tent reliance on auxiliary length features: training
samples with longer chosen labels than rejected
ones lead to overestimated rewards during training,
while those with shorter chosen labels result in un-
derestimated rewards. Therefore, overestimated re-wards contribute more significantly to gradient op-
timization, ultimately exacerbating verbosity. We
believe this algorithmic dependence on response
length is a unique drawback of DPO, since the ex-
plicit rewards in RLHF typically manifest as scalar
values (Ouyang et al., 2022).
We propose that addressing this reliance on re-
sponse length can be effectively achieved through a
straightforward down-sampling method. Illustrated
in the middle of Figure 1, this approach involves
down-sampling equal token-level probability fea-
tures for computing regularized KL divergences.
Our contributions in this paper are threefold:
•We analyze the algorithmic dependence on
response length in DPO, revaling how it re-
sults in overestimated or underestimated re-
wards. Through decomposition experiments
using datasets with varying label length, we
empirically demonstrate the biased rewards.
•We propose a lightweight approach, called
SamPO, to mitigate the biased length reliance
in DPO. By simply down-sampling equal
probability features at the token-level, we can
apply DPO with regularized KL divergences.
•We validate our method using three different
LLMs of varying scales. Compared to DPO,
SamPO significantly reduces verbosity. Lever-
aging debaised rewards, we achieve signif-
icant improvements across five conditioned
and three open-ended benchmarks, as de-
picted in the lower section of Figure 1.2 Related Work
Optimization from Human Preference aims to
align neural models with human minds. As a sem-
inal work, (Stiennon et al., 2020) collected hu-
man preferences on 123k pairs of summary outputs,
then trained a reward model that guides the GPT-3
model (Brown et al., 2020) to produce more co-
herent and human-preferred summaries. (Ouyang
et al., 2022) then further scaled similar pipeline
with 1M diverse text instructions, and reported
that outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT
model were preferred to outputs from the 175B
GPT-3 model, according to downstream human
evaluation. RLHF has become an essential part
of aligning LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023; Bi et al.,
2024; Bai et al., 2023; Young et al., 2024). How-
ever, as it follows a multi-stage training strategy,
and heavily relays on the quality of reward model,
RLHF’s training cost and stability are widely criti-
cized (Zheng et al., 2023; McKinney et al., 2023).
Therefore, DPO came into being, providing a stable
alternative that does not rely on an explicit reward
model (Rafailov et al., 2023). It has been proved
that DPO can achieve the same alignment effect as
RLHF (Ivison et al., 2023; Hou et al., 2024).
Over-optimization in RL is a well-known obsta-
cle (Skalse et al., 2022; Pan et al., 2023a; Casper
et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023), which refers to
the phenomenon that feedback scores from the re-
ward model are getting higher, but the updated pol-
icy model produces lower quality responses. And
one particularly noticeable low-quality feature is
verbosity. It is general to blame for exploitation
of reward model (Casper et al., 2023; Gao et al.,
2023a), and thus various regularization approaches
have been proposed, including uncertainty-based
regularization (Coste et al., 2023; Zhai et al., 2023),
composite reward models (Moskovitz et al., 2023),
and length decorrelation (Chen et al., 2024b). How-
ever, since the reward model is eliminated in DPO,
none of the above approaches can be directly ap-
plied. Herein, specific methods are introduced,
(Park et al., 2024) introduced a pairwise length reg-
ularization term to dampen the verbosity trends,
and SimPO (Meng et al., 2024) used average prob-
ability to eliminate length reliance.
In this paper, we present that the verbosity is-
sue in DPO is further related to algorithmic biased
length reliance, which is never analyzed in previ-
ous literature. And this drawback can be effectively
handled via down-sampling over KL divergence.3 SamPO: Down-Sampled DPO
In this section, we first give a brief introduction of
DPO’s optimization target (§3.1), then dive into fur-
ther analysis of its potential length reliance (§3.2).
Subsequently, we present SamPO, which intuitively
regularizes the biased length-specific reward (§3.3).
3.1 Preliminary Background of DPO
DPO implements direct RLHF based on of-
fline preference data and offloaded reward model.
Specifically, DPO first re-parameterizes the reward
model in multi-stage RLHF as follows:
rϕ(x, y) =βlogπθ(y|x)
πref(y|x)+βlogZ(x)(1)
where rϕ,πθandπrefstand for reward model,
policy model and reference model, respectively.
πθandπrefare usually initialized from same SFT
model. πθis about to be further optimized in DPO,
whileπrefis usually frozen. Z(x)is the partition
function, and βis a hyperparameter that adjust
the intensity of rewards. DPO then incorporates
Bradley-Terry model:
Pθ(yw≻yl|x) =exp(rϕ(x, yw))
exp(rϕ(x, yw)) + exp( rϕ(x, yl))(2)
where a preference triplet (x,yw,yl)consists of a
prompt instruction x, a chosen response yw, and
a rejected response yl. The Bradley-Terry model
hypothesizes that preference probability Pθcan be
estimated via pairwise comparison.
Ldpo(πθ;πref) =−E(x,yw,yl)∼D[logσ(∆)] (3)
∆ =βlogπθ(yw|x)
πref(yw|x)−βlogπθ(yl|x)
πref(yl|x)(4)
where Eq. 3 stands for the loss of DPO by insert-
ing Eq. 1 into Eq. 2. σstands for sigmoid func-
tion, and Ddenotes the entire pairwise preference
dataset. The implicit reward ∆in Eq. 4 is for-
malized as discrepancy between chosen KL diver-
gence logπθ(yw|x)
πref(yw|x)and rejected KL divergence
logπθ(yl|x)
πref(yl|x). Each KL divergence is calculated
upon the tokens in the response y. Considering
Eq. 3, the gradients of DPO can be written as:
∇θLdpo(πθ;πref) =−E(x,yw,yl)∼D[βσ(−∆)M](5)
M=∇θlogπ(yw|x)− ∇ θlogπ(yl|x) (6)
whereMis a discrepancy term that lead the policy
model πθto increase likelihood of chosen response
ywand decrease likelihood of rejected response yl
simultaneously. The ∆is regarded as the weight
that scales the intensity of M.Figure 2: The inequality of pairwise responses, illustrated by typical examples, forces DPO to overestimate or
underestimate actual rewards. In the upper sub-figure (a), we present DPO’s chosen rewardPlogπθ(yw|x)
πref(yw|x)and
rejected rewardPlogπθ(yl|x)
πref(yl|x)with red and purple curves, respectively. Each response’s reward is sequence-level
KL divergence, summarizing from token-level log probability ratios (the green and blue bars). Therefore, the
difference gap between two lines draws the implicit reward target in DPO, as shown in Eq. 7. Similarly, we show
averagely normalized DPO in left bottom sub-figure (b), and show our SamPO in right bottom sub-figure (c).
3.2 Biased Length Reliance in DPO
The loss of DPO and its gradient are computed at
sequence-level. That is, when calculating the KL
divergence logπθ(y|x)
πref(y|x), DPO treats probabilities
of tokens as discrete samples. Therefore, we can
denote Eq. 4 at token-level (Proof in App. A):
∆ =βTwX
t=1logπθ(yt
w|x)
πref(ytw|x)−βTlX
t=1logπθ(yt
l|x)
πref(yt
l|x)(7)
where TwandTldemote the number of 1st to t-th
tokens in chosen response ywand rejected response
yl, respectively. Similarly, we re-write Eq. 6:
M=∇θTwX
t=1logπ(yt
w|x)− ∇ θTlX
t=1logπ(yt
l|x)(8)Herein, we can intuitively perceive the impact of
the inequality in length between chosen response
ywand rejected response ylon loss and gradient.
As illustrated in sub-Figure 2(a), a “ comparable
reward ” is obtained if ywandylshare same length,
with which DPO fairly learns the quality difference.
However, if ywis much longer than yl, it is likely
that the significant lead in the total amount of to-
kens in ywbrings about “ overestimated reward ” in
Eq. 7, and contributes more to the gradient updates
in Eq. 5 and 8. Reversely, DPO could “ underes-
timate reward ” and adopt less gradients if ywis
shorter than yl, even ywhas better quality. This bi-
ased length reliance makes DPO prefer long, plau-
sible chosen responses but disregards short, sound
chosen responses in training, leading to verbosity.3.3 Debiased KL Divergence
We consider two common strategies to eliminate
length reliance: averaging and sampling.
Averaging the sequence-level KL divergence
to instead use marginal averaged reward is the
most straightforward idea for length regularization,
which modify Eq. 7 as follows:
∆ =βTwP
t=1logπθ(yt
w|x)
πref(ytw|x)
|Tw|−β|Tl|P
t=1logπθ(yt
l|x)
πref(yt
l|x)
|Tl|(9)
Such averaged normalization can simply elimi-
nate length reliance. However, as shown in the
left corner of Figure 2(b), there lies scale differ-
ence between marginal averaged reward with orig-
inal sequence-level reward. Thus, we scale the
marginal reward with a dynamic scaling factor
(Tw+Tl)
2, which is the average length of chosen
response ywand rejected response yl.
Sampling same amount of tokens from the cho-
sen and rejected responses, and calculating down-
sampled sequence-level KL divergence for the im-
plicit reward. Eq. 7 as follows:
∆ =βTmX
t=1logπθ(yt
w|x)
πref(ytw|x)−βTmX
t=1logπθ(yt
l|x)
πref(yt
l|x)
Tm=min(Tw, Tl),yt∼Uniform (Tm,{y}T)(10)
where Tmequals to the minimum token length of
(Tw,Tl), andytis down-sampled from all tokens
{yT}uniformly. Eq. 10 is consistent with the cor-
responding reward term in Figure 1, as shown in
the middle. In addition, we provide ablation studies
of sampling randomness in Appendix E.
Figure 2(b) and (c) demonstrate that either aver-
aging or sampling can lead to comparable length-
debiased rewards. However, the simple averaging
vanishes the variance feature among tokens. We
thus confirm to use down-sampling strategy in pro-
posed SamPO. We validate this choice in section 5.
4 Experimental Setup
In this section, we begin with our datasets (§ 4.1,
§ 4.2), then follow with baselines (§ 4.3, § 4.4), and
an overview of our experimental design (§ 4.5).
4.1 Training Datasets
We include three independent preference datasets
for training. Two datasets in consistent with the
original DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023): The 161k HH-
RLHF data (Ganguli et al., 2022), and the 92.8k
TL;DR data (Völske et al., 2017). And the 61kbinarized UltraFeedback data (Cui et al., 2023) that
has been adopted in many following works (Ivison
et al., 2023; Meng et al., 2024) of DPO. All datasets
own evaluation sets for cross-validation in training.
4.2 Evaluation Benchmarks
Following DPO, with models training upon HH-
RLHF or TL;DR, we randomly select 256 samples
from its evaluation set for final testing. We report
the win rate between the response of fine-tuned pol-
icy model ˆyθ=πθ(xtest)and the response of basis
SFT model ˆyref=πref(xtest), judged by GPT-
4 (Achiam et al., 2023). As for models training
with UltraFeedback, we use five conditional and
one open-ended generation benchmarks. The con-
ditional benchmarks and their in-context examples
are: GSM8K in 8-shot (Cobbe et al., 2021), IFEval
in 3-shot (Zhou et al., 2023), PiQA in 3-shot (Bisk
et al., 2020), MMLU in 0-shot (Hendrycks et al.,
2021), and TruthfulQA in 3-shot (Lin et al., 2022).
The open-ended data is AlpacaEval2 (Li et al.,
2023). We report match accuracy of conditional
benchmarks, and report length-debiased GPT-4 win
rate of AlpacaEval2 (Dubois et al., 2024a). Check
more evaluation details in Appendix B.
4.3 Foundation Models
We include LLMs varying three different scales:
Pythia-2.8B (Biderman et al., 2023), Llama3-8B-
Instruct (AI@Meta, 2024), and Tulu2-13B-SFT
(Ivison et al., 2023). We report details of these
LLMs, hyperparameters, and cost in Appendix C.
4.4 Baselines
Many variants of DPO have been proposed, and
can be categorized into three types: (1) Reduce
cost. Despite the robustness, preparing high-quality
pair-wise preference labels and running with two
giant models makes DPO still expensive. As such,
KTO (Ethayarajh et al., 2024) proposed to use
non-pairwise preference data. ORPO (Hong et al.,
2024), CPO (Xu et al., 2024), and SimPO (Meng
et al., 2024) suggested new reference-free losses to
optimize with single policy model; (2) Alleviate
overfitting . IPO (Azar et al., 2023) analyzed the
risk of overfitting, and presented a square loss to re-
form the monotonous DPO loss. TDPO (Zeng et al.,
2024) incorporated forward KL divergence con-
straints for each token, improving alignment and
diversity. BCO (Jung et al., 2024) and NCA (Chen
et al., 2024a) provided plans to relieve the noisefrom the pairwise preference responses; (3) Over-
come verbosity . One notable degradation side
effect of DPO is verbosity, which refers to generate
longer and longer responses during training, while
the actual answer quality are not improved at the
same time. (Park et al., 2024) introduced a pair-
wise length regularization term to dampen the ver-
bosity trends, and SimPO (Meng et al., 2024) used
average probability to eliminate length reliance.
We select methods that are targeted at noise re-
moval or length normalization and have relatively
positive testing results as our final baselines: Hy-
brid DPO+SFT, TDPO (Zeng et al., 2024), Length-
normed DPO (Park et al., 2024), BCO (Jung et al.,
2024), SimPO (Meng et al., 2024). Particularly,
Hybrid DPO+SFT refers to multi-task learning of
DPO on the pairwise responses and SFT on the cho-
sen response at the same time, which is a common
practice (Hua et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024).
4.5 Experimental Designs
In general, we design three groups of experiments:
(1)Presence of biased length reliance . We ex-
tract two 27k subsets from the UltraFeed-
back only by response length. One is named
UltraFeedback-long, in which the chosen re-
sponse of each data must be longer than the
rejected response. The other one is named
UltraFeedback-short, and as the name sug-
gests, it contains shorter chosen response. We
use these subsets for biased reward exhibition.
(2)Preliminary Study of DPO and variants .
Given that there are many variants of DPO,
and they often use their own hyperparameters,
we first conduct a preliminary study to align
their performance under the same conditions.
This study helps us select several robust base-
lines. The results are reported in Appendix D.
(3)Experiments with various LLMs . Similar
to DPO, we use Pythia-2.8B to train and test
SamPO on HH-RLHF or TL;DR; on the other
hand, following relevant studies (Ivison et al.,
2023; Hong et al., 2024), we use Tulu2-13B-
SFT and Llama3-8B-Instruct to train on Ultra-
feedback and verify SamPO on public bench-
marks. Also, literature reports that iteratively
update the frozen reference model πrefcan
obtain further gains (Gorbatovski et al., 2024;
Zhang et al., 2024). Thus, we combine it with
SamPO to present Iterative SamPO.

5 Experimental Results
In this section, following above designs, we first
report the group experiments of length reliance
(§ 5.1), then present comparison studies against
strong baselines (§ 5.2). We discuss quantitative
results in the main body. We leave more ablation
studies and case analysis in Appendix E, F, and H.
5.1 Group study of length reliance
Figure 3 illustrates the trends of DPO’s implicit
reward on same test set, when we fine-tuning the
same Tulu2-13B-SFT model with different subsets
of UltraFeedback. We report testing performance
in Table 1. It is clear that data from the same distri-
bution, just due to the difference in response length,
leads to different training and testing performance.
The “ -all” set refers to training with original
UltraFeedback, which mix “ -long ” and “ -short ”
data. The “ -long ” subset provides overestimated
rewards and therefore causes performance degra-
dation. However, since statistically, the chosen
response does being longer than the rejected re-
sponse (Park et al., 2024), the training trend of the
“-long ” subset is similar to the “ -all” full set. On the
contrary, the “ -short ” subset completely erases theTulu2-13B-SFT

distinctive feature of length, hoping that the model
will perform comparative learning based on con-
tent quality. However, the biased DPO completely
underestimate the reward, thus causing collapses.
Yet, our SamPO presents debaised rewards. We
can observe debiased positive rewards on the “ -
short ” set. And the debaised rewards of “ -all” set
grow to a high peak at 300 steps. Such debiased
rewards result in significant U-turn reversal and fur-
ther improvements. As shown in Table 1, SamPO
manages to eliminate collapse on the “ -short ” set,
where we record a normal average benchmark score
similar to the “ -long ” set, improving the score by
9.2%. Thanks to the regularization of those “ short ”
data, the “ -all” set that mix both “ long” and “ short ”
data, achieves the best score up to 52.81 on average.
5.2 Comparison study against other methods
5.2.1 Study on UltraFeedback
For LLMs that fine-tuned with UltraFeedback, we
evaluate their downstream performance in Table 2.
Overall enhancement by SamPO . For Tulu2-
13B-SFT, our replicated DPO shows benchmark
accuracy and response length on AlpacaEval2 datacomparable to the open-source version. Compared
to the SFT baseline, DPO improves performance
across all test data but increases response length
by 40-45%. Iterative DPO exacerbates this ver-
bosity issue. However, all chosen baselines and
our SamPOs produce shorter responses, mitigating
verbosity. TDPO and SimPO, however, show sig-
nificant drops in conditional benchmarks, such as
over 10% on GSM8K and over 3% on TruthfulQA,
compared to DPO. Notably, our SamPOs achieve
overall improvements on both conditional bench-
marks (+0.5%) and open-ended generation for Al-
pacaEval2 prompts (+4%). Also, the averaging
version DPO-SANorm, mentioned in section 3.3,
confirms that the sampling strategy is more valid.
For Llama3-8B-Instruct, we observe superior
length stability. Even when fine-tuned with origi-
nal DPO, the model maintains its initial response
length, likely due to its comprehensive training pro-
cess involving SFT, RLHF, and DPO (AI@Meta,
2024). Marginal improvements are observed over
its DPO version, with average gains of 1.7% on
five conditional benchmarks and <1% on AlpacaE-
val2. Among all methods, only hybrid DPO+SFT,Figure 4: We show how the policy model’s response
length changes on AlpacEval2 as the test performance
improves over 3 epochs of training. The epoch number
increases from left to right along the curve.
SimPO, and our SamPOs show significant improve-
ments over DPO, with average gains of 1.3% to 3%
on five accuracy benchmarks. Specifically, hybrid
DPO+SFT excels in IFEval (65.83), and our Sam-
POs notably improve GSM8K (+2.3%) and Truth-
fulQA (+3.7%). As for GPT-4 judged AlpacaEval2,
hybrid training loses about 3% performance, while
our SamPO achieves the best performance in both
raw and length-debiased scores among all locally
fine-tuned LLMs, outperforming DPO up to 12%.
Discussions of SimPO . The SimPO method has
an obvious “ seesaw ” dilemma. The open source
SimPO checkpoint achieves the best performance
of AlpacaEval2, at the expense of a significant sac-
rifice on other benchmarks. We avoid this in the
reproduction and obtain a more balanced version.
Also, the public release was trained with boosted
data2instead of the naive UltraFeedback.
Length stability of SamPO . Based on Figure 4,
we find that DPO makes the model increasingly pre-
fer to generate longer responses in 3-epoch training,
and Iterative DPO further strengthens this trend.
In contrast, SamPO and Iterative SamPO achieve
higher testing scores and keeping the length stable.
5.2.2 Study on HH-RLHF & TL;DR
As for HH-RLHF and TL;DR, we utilize Pythia-
2.8B for all experiments. Given that Pythia has not
been specifically trained for instructional tasks, we
initiate our process with one epoch of SFT on the
chosen response, following DPO’s setup. Subse-
quently, we conduct preference optimization using
SamPO alongside various baseline methods. Fol-

lowing previous literature (Rafailov et al., 2023;
Park et al., 2024), GPT-4 served as the proxy for
human preference. We report the win rate against
the SFT basis, and the average generated token
length of all methods in Table 3.
SamPO has good effect on HH-RLHF . SamPO
improves performance across all HH-RLHF test
data, achieving the second-best win rate while
maintaining a lower yet reasonable response length.
Iterative SamPO shows slightly lower win rates
due to less control over response length. Base-
lines such as Iterative DPO and TDPO achieve
win rates close to 50%, indicating minimal im-
provement over the SFT model. Hybrid DPO+SFT
stands out as a strong baseline, addressing the
under-generalization issue and attaining an 86.12%
win rate with a shortest average response lengths
among all experiments. SimPO, while achieving a
similar win rate of 78.91% as Iterative SamPO, but
it produces incredibly low response length.
SamPO achieves the best performance on
TL;DR . In terms of TL;DR, SamPO and Iterative
SamPO show the highest win rates, with 65.71%
and 73.58% respectively, significantly outperform-
ing all other methods. DPO and Length-normed
DPO also perform well, achieving win rates of
60.98% and 58.13% respectively. Iterative DPO
reaches the best while using longer answers than
Iterative SamPO. In contrast, SimPO has the low-
est win rate at 33.33%, indicating that it is less
effective on the TL;DR dataset.
Over-simplification by SimPO . In fact, on HH-
RLHF, we notice many of the outputs from SimPO
are overly simplified, often omitting necessary con-
tent and resulting in only 14.77 length of tokens on
average. For example, a preferred response from
HH-RLHF is “ I’ll give you the links. ”, whereas the
SimPO response is simply “ Sure! ”. This suggeststhat while concise, the responses lack the necessary
informativeness. In this scenario, we can see GPT-
4 prefers over-simplified responses, which proba-
bly due to the binary setup of preference choice.
Similarly, on TL;DR, SimPO produces the shortest
responses (averagely 31.90 tokens). We also ob-
serve SimPO’s extremely concise summaries, some
of them even grammatically incorrect. For exam-
ple, a preferred summary from the TL;DR is “ I
[20M] met a great girl [16F] online who lives in
the same city. Problems are: she’s moving away, I
want to meet her, and the obvious age gap. ”, while
SimPO outputs a shorter summary without subject
and capitalizes fist letter: “ online flirt turns into
legit relationship. Great chemistry. Age gap and
distance issues. Need advice before final meetup
before long trip abroad. ”.
5.2.3 Human Evaluation of SamPO
In addition to the aforementioned automated evalu-
ation, we further conduct large-scale human eval-
uation to study the effectiveness of the SamPO
algorithm when applied to super large LLM (e.g,
over 50B). We use an LLM fine-tuned based on
Qwen1.5-72B (Bai et al., 2023) as a starting point
and fine-tune it for 1 epoch using the proposed
SamPO method. The training data is a general
preference dataset of around 480k samples.
We report the results of human evaluation in Ta-
ble 4, covering three most popular scenarios: gen-
eral Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC), log-
ical reasoning (e.g., math or logic questions), and
open domain dialogues in role-play settings. We
have hired a 30-person annotation team, each of
whom has at least a bachelor’s degree or above.
And each test scenario contains 500 to 1k carefully
crafted challenging instances, which then cross-
labeled by multiple professional annotators. Our
scoring criteria are relatively simple, distinguishing
only between incorrect and acceptable responses.
We observe that SamPO significantly outperforms
both the SFT Base and DPO method on all tasks.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we identify and address the verbosity
issue in DPO related to biased length reliance. We
propose that the discrepancy between sequence-
level KL divergences for chosen and rejected se-
quences can lead to biased rewards. This inherent
length reliance results in the policy model favoring
longer yet plausible responses. Thus, we propose
SamPO, an approach that regularizes the KL diver-MRC Logical Reasoning RolePlay Avg.

gence by down-sampling equal token-level features.
Our empirical evaluations across three different
LLMs and diverse datasets show that SamPO ef-
fectively reduces verbosity and improves overall
performance by providing debiased rewards.
Limitations
While our proposed method, SamPO, has shown
promising results in mitigating verbosity and im-
proving performance, several limitations remain:
•Scalability . Although we test SamPO on dif-
ferent LLMs, including one super large LLM
(Qwen1.5-72B-Instruct). We agree that fur-
ther experiments are needed to confirm its
scalability and generalization across a broader
range of models with different scales.
•Computational Overhead . The SamPO’s
down-sampling approach introduces addi-
tional computational steps during training.
While the overhead is relatively small, it may
still be a concern for extremely large models
or resource-constrained environments. Op-
timizing the implementation for efficiency
could be an area of future research.
•Human Evaluation . We conducted large-
scale yet simple binary human evaluations to-
wards SamPO. Nevertheless, we agree further
multi-dimensional evaluations would offer a
more accurate assessment of SamPO.

A.1 Token-level DPO reward
Given the DPO’s implicit reward ∆in Eq. 4:
∆ =βlogπθ(yw|x)
πref(yw|x)−βlogπθ(yl|x)
πref(yl|x)
and we know when given a prompt x, the probabil-
ity of a response yfrom a LLM πis:
π(y|x) =TY
t=1π(yt|y<t, x)
where Trepresents the length of token sequence of
y,y<tdenotes all the tokens before the t-th index
iny, andytis thet-th generated token. Thus, when
convert DPO’s sequence-level implicit reward ∆
to a token-level expression, we can write:
∆ =βlogπθ(yw|x)
πref(yw|x)−βlogπθ(yl|x)
πref(yl|x)
=βlogQTw
1πθ(yw,t|yw,<t, x)QTw
1πref(yw,t|yw,<t, x)
−βlogQTl
1πθ(yl,t|yl,<t, x)QTl
1πref(yl,t|yl,<t, x)
=βTwX
t=1logπθ(yw,t|yw,<t, x)
πref(yw,t|yw,<t, x)−βTlX
t=1logπθ(yl,t|yl,<t, x)
πref(yl,t|yl,<t, x)
=βTwX
t=1logπθ(yt
w|x)
πref(ytw|x)−βTlX
t=1logπθ(yt
l|x)
πref(yt
l|x), in short
For the down-sampling phase, we have:
∆ =βlogQTm
1πθ(yw,t|yw,<t, x)QTm
1πref(yw,t|yw,<t, x)−βlogQTm
1πθ(yl,t|yl,<t, x)QTm
1πref(yl,t|yl,<t, x)
=βTmX
t=1logπθ(yt
w|x)
πref(ytw|x)−βTmX
t=1logπθ(yt
l|x)
πref(yt
l|x), in short
where Tm=min(Tw,Tl),yt∼Uniform (Tm,{y}T)
A.2 Gradients of Token-level DPO reward
Given the DPO’s gradients ∇θLdpo(πθ;πref)re-
lated to the Eq. 5 and 6:
∇θLdpo(πθ;πref) =−E(x,yw,yl)∼D[βσ(−∆)M]
M=∇θlogπ(yw|x)− ∇ θlogπ(yl|x)
we derive the token-level expression of M:M=∇θlogπ(yw|x)− ∇ θlogπ(yl|x)
=∇θlogTwY
t=1π(yw,t|yw,<t, x)
− ∇ θlogTlY
t=1π(yl,t|yl,<t, x)
=∇θTwX
t=1logπ(yt
w|x)− ∇ θTwX
t=1logπ(yt
l|x), in short
For the down-sampling phase, we have:
M=∇θlogTmY
t=1π(yw,t|yw,<t, x)
− ∇ θlogTmY
t=1π(yl,t|yl,<t, x)
=∇θTmX
t=1logπ(yt
w|x)− ∇ θTmX
t=1logπ(yt
l|x), in short
where Tm=min(Tw,Tl),yt∼Uniform (Tm,{y}T)
Therefore, combined with length-normalized ∆
introduced in section A.1. We have debiased gradi-
ents∇θLdpo(πθ;πref)to be served in SamPO.
B Evaluation Details
We present the details of our evolution schema:
•GSM8K: A generative primary level math
dataset of 1.3k questions (Cobbe et al., 2021).
We use 8-shot in-context exemplars. We re-
port strict exact match score.
•IFEval: A special instruction-following test
dataset, contains 541 verifiable instructions,
such as “write in more than 400 words” (Zhou
et al., 2023). We use 3-shot prompt and report
instruction-level strict accuracy.
•PiQA: A binary common physical knowledge
dataset of 1.8k questions (Bisk et al., 2020).
The number of in-context exemplars is three.
We report accuracy score of PiQA.
•MMLU: One of the most popular and largest
multi-choice benchmark for testing common
knowledge of LLMs, covering 14k ques-
tions (Hendrycks et al., 2021). No in-context
exemplars provided, and we present accuracy.•TruthfulQA: A testing dataset aims for as-
sessing a model’s recognition of true state-
ments (Lin et al., 2022). We use its multi-
choice subset (single-true), evaluating all 817
questions with 3-shot prompt, and reporting
accuracy score as well.
•AlpacaEval2: An AI-driven open-ended gen-
eration testing dataset (Li et al., 2023). This
dataset contains 805 diverse questions, and
compares the win rate of model’s response
against GPT-4’s response (Achiam et al.,
2023). The winner judge is also the GPT-4.
We also include a length-debiased win rate
that mitigate the potential length preference
from the judge LLM (Dubois et al., 2024a).
•HH-RLHF: A dataset contains 161k pair
of multi-round conversational human pref-
erence data about helpfulness and harmless-
ness (Ganguli et al., 2022). We report each
approaches’ win rate against the SFT basis.
•TL;DR: A summarization obtained based on
Reddit conversations (Völske et al., 2017),
contains 92.8k training data. We report win
rate between every model and the basic SFT.
Based on the evaluation methods and metrics of the
above datasets, we classify the first five test sets as
conditional benchmarks and the last three test sets
as open-ended benchmarks. “Conditional” type
means that the model must generate corresponding
answers according to a given format requirement,
in order to calculate exact match score or accu-
racy in the end. While “Open-ended” type is more
flexible and only requires the model to generate a
free-form response to a given prompt.
For all conditional benchmarks, we use a stable
and popular evaluation framework “lm-evaluation-
harness” (Gao et al., 2023b)4. As for open-ended
benchmarks, we report specific evaluation tem-
plates for AlpacaEval2, HH-RLHF and TL;DR in
Appendix I. Particularly, we use the official tool
to evaluate AlpacaEval25. The version of GPT-4
evaluator is all set as: gpt-4-turbo.

We report hyperparameters and training cost in Ta-
ble 5. Considering the adaptability of the algorithm

on different devices, we fine-tune Pythia-2.8B6
with all involved methods on 1 GPU, while fine-
tune Llama3-8B-Insturct7and Tulu2-13B-SFT8on
8 GPUs. We obey licenses of all involved mod-
els. All baselines and our SamPO share a com-
mon DPO beta of Eq. 4, as all methods are variants
of DPO. We set this beta value as 0.1, same as
the original DPO work. Except that, since many
variants include new hyperparamters, we set them
accordingly. One particular exception is SimPO,
for which small Beta 0.1 and 3 epochs will lead to
performance collapse. As such, we have to follow
its original quite large Beta value 2.5. In general,
larger Beta encourages the policy model to explore
a larger optimization space.
The optimizer is AdamW (Loshchilov and Hut-
ter, 2019) and the scheduler is WarmupDecayLR
(Goyal et al., 2017). Deepspeed (Ren et al., 2021)
and Flash Attention2 (Dao et al., 2022) are used for
speedup. In addition, the combination of SFT train-
ing in Hybrid DPO+SFT, and the down-sampling
openration in SamPO, will bring additional compu-
tational time. Yet, the overall training time doesn’t
increase a lot in our full-parameter tuning mode.

D Preliminary Study of DPO & Variants
As aforementioned (§ 4.5), we conduct a prelimi-
nary study to align the performance of DPO and its
variants under the almost same conditions (Table 5).
We comprehensively consider the motivations and
the actual test results (Table 6), then finally select
three categories of seven baselines: (1) Naive DPO
with common practice . DPO, Iterative DPO, and
Hybrid DPO+SFT; (2) DPO with noise removal .
TDPO and BCO; (3) DPO with verbosity cutoff .
Length-normed DPO and SimPO.
E Influence of Different Random Seed
We present a group of randomness experiments
to test the robustness of SamPO to different ran-
dom seeds, as shown in the middle of Table 7. The
results show there are marginal ups and downs in-terms of both performance scores and generated
length of token amounts, due to different random
seeds. However, the overall stability and effective-
ness of our SamPO can be confirmed.
F Influence of Different Beta in Eq. 1
We present a group of ablation experiments to learn
the downstream performance of SamPO given dif-
ferent scaling hyperparameter βin Eq. 1. The re-
sults are reported in the bottom half of Table 7.
Among all conditional benchmarks, we observe ob-
vious degradation on TruthfulQA when βgrows.
While for evaluation on the AlpacaEval2, the stan-
dard score first go up then go down, and β0.3 leads
to the peak. In contrast, length-debiased evaluation
score continues to decline as βincreases. Partic-
ularly, the larger βmeans higher training inten-Figure 5: Case examples of AlpacaEval2, generated by Llama3-8B-Instruct-SamPO and -DPO. We annotate correct
highlights of the SamPO model by underlines , and bold shortcomings of the DPO model with red.

sity of SamPO (Eq. 1), which makes the fine-tuned
model produce closer output length to the base
Llama3-8B-Instruct, and a smaller gap between
length-biased and -debiased Alpaca scores.
G Random K vs. Top K
In addition to the random K down-sampling strat-
egy we used in SamPO, an interesting discussion is
whether we can replace with top K down-sampling,
using the largest token-level log probability ratio
as features, as visualized in Figure 6. Specifically,
the K here refers to the minimum token length Tm
(Eq. 10). Compared with sub-Figure 2(c), Top K
down-sampling brings larger implicit rewards. Wereport the effect of this method in SamPO-TopK
at the bottom of Table 6. SamPO-TopK leads to a
similar performance compared with original DPO,
while SamPO with random K is still dominant.
H Case Analysis
In this section, we introduce exemplars to an-
alyze the qualitative outputs from different ap-
proaches. We analyze two cases for each test
set: AlpacaEval2 (§ H.1), HH-RLHF (§ H.2), and
TL;DR (§ H.3), in each section respectively.
H.1 Case analysis on AlpacaEval2
Figure 5 illustrates two concrete cases from Al-
pacaEval2. The left side one is asking “ the built
year of Yamato Battleship ”, which belongs to
knowledge expression. The Llama3-8B-Instruct-
SamPO, shown in the upper left, correctly states
that “ the Yamato was laid down on November 4,
1937, launched on December 19, 1941, and com-
missioned on December 16, 1942 ”. However, the
DPO model incorrectly states that “ there was no
battleship specifically called "Yamato" ”, which is
misleading . As for the right-side math reasoning
question, both models manage to correctly iden-
tify the relationship between Navina’s budget and
her younger sister’s budget, avoiding generate hal-
lucinations of their specific amounts. However,
Llama3-8B-Instruct-DPO shows more verbosity,Question Prompt I:
Human: What is Ryan Reynold’s email address?
Assistant: Here’s a website where you can send Ryan Reynold an email: http://www.inmail.com/
Reynold.Ryan/
Human: That sounds cool.
Assistant:
Chosen Response: I agree. That website even lets you customize your email!
[Model Outputs 1] DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023): It’s a great way to stay in touch with Ryan Reynold,
and to get in touch with him if you have any questions or concerns. You can also send him a message if
you want to say hello or ask him a question. Have a great day!
[Model Outputs 2] SimPO (Meng et al., 2024): It’s a good way to stay in touch.
[Model Outputs 3] SamPO (ours): It’s a great way to stay in touch with Ryan Reynold. I hope you
enjoy it!
[Model Outputs 4] Iterative SamPO (ours): It’s a great way to stay in touch with Ryan Reynold, and
he’s a very friendly and helpful person. You can send him a message anytime to ask questions or get
advice, and he’ll be happy to help.
[GPT-4 Ranking]: [3] > [2] > [1] > [4]
Question Prompt II:
Human: What are the 14 words?
Assistant: I only know that the original 14 words are a true story about a soldier who was killed in the
Spanish Civil War, and his last words were, "I die with the 14 words of freedom in my heart."
Human: What were the 14 words of freedom?
Assistant: They were the 14 words written by Ernesto Guevara: "Socialism and Freedom have been
affirmed by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. That is why we should uphold them."
Human: That’s more than 14 words.
Assistant:
Chosen Response: That’s different than being alone. You can be alone with other people if you don’t
actually communicate with them.
[Model Outputs 1] DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023): Yes, that’s correct. The 14 words are a quote from
Ernesto Guevara, and they are the words he wrote in his last letter to his wife, Raquel, before he was killed
in Bolivia in 1967.
[Model Outputs 2] SimPO (Meng et al., 2024): I think it is a good reminder of the importance of
freedom and democracy.
[Model Outputs 3] SamPO (ours): Yes, that is correct. The 14 words of freedom were written by
Ernesto Guevara, and they were: ‘Socialism and freedom have been affirmed by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and
Stalin. That is why we should uphold them.’
[Model Outputs 4] Iterative SamPO (ours): Yes, the original 14 words were actually a quote from the
Cuban revolutionary Ernesto Guevara, who was a major figure in the Cuban Revolution. The words were
meant to be a call to action for the Cuban people, and they were a powerful statement of the ideals of
socialism and freedom.

introducing an unnecessary variable “ y” and in-
cludes conditions that are irrelevant to the question.
H.2 Case analysis on HH-RLHF
We present two cases of HH-RLHF in Table 8.
For the first question, GPT-4 ranks: SamPO >
SimPO > DPO > Interative SamPO. SamPO’s re-sponse is concise, friendly, and directly addresses
the user’s comment positively, similar to the golden
answer’s tone. The response from SimPO is
also positive and concise but lacks the additional
friendly tone found in the golden answer. DPO
provides additional context and is friendly, but
it is more verbose and slightly repetitive. Inter-ative SamPO’s answer is the least aligned with the
golden answer as it assumes too much about Ryan
Reynold’s willingness to help, which might not be
accurate, and it is longer than necessary.
The second question is about discussions of a
quote. GPT-4 ranks: Iterative SamPO > DPO >
SamPO > SimPO. Iterative SamPO ranks highest as
it provides detailed context about Ernesto Guevara
and the significance of the quote, aligning well with
the chosen response. It acknowledges the historical
figure and the ideals behind the quote, making it
informative and relevant. DPO follows, providing
context about Ernesto Guevara but incorrectly at-
tributing the words to a letter to his wife. Despite
this, it gives useful historical information and ad-
dresses the significance of the quote. SamPO ranks
third, as it reiterates the incorrect quote without
adding new or helpful information. It still exceeds
14 words and does not directly address the question
about the word count. SimPO is the least informa-
tive. It generates a response that is vague, shifting
the focus to a general statement about freedom and
democracy, which is not relevant to the original
context. It does not address the discrepancy in the
word count and provides no additional context.
H.3 Case analysis on TL;DR
Table 9 illustrates two concrete cases from TL;DR.
For the first case: The DPO model’s TL;DR cor-
rectly retains most of the original details. Our Iter-
ative SamPO method strikes a balance by maintain-
ing key details while trimming redundant informa-
tion (e.g., “ 5 continuous days ” to “ 5 days ”), offer-
ing a coherent and comprehensive summary. The
SimPO model provides a more concise summary;
however, it over-optimizes by omitting too many
details and using an arithmetic formula (“ busy
semester schedule + lack of sleep = wasted time ”)
to replace some connection words.
For the second case: The DPO’s output exces-
sively repeats sentences, leading to model degen-
eration. The SimPO model condenses the sum-
mary too much, resulting in contradictions with
the original source. For example, the person ex-
plicitly states, “ They aren’t sexual dreams, ” but
SimPO’s output concludes with “ recurring sex-
ual dreams. ” In comparison, the Iterative SamPO
model accurately captures the emotional conflict
and the essence of the original message, providing
a clear and faithful summary.I GPT-4 Judged Winner Templates
We present employed GPT-4 judged winner tem-
plates for win rate computation. The evaluation
templates for AlpacaEval2, HH-RLHF and TL;DR
are in Table 10, and Table 11, respectively.Question Prompt I: I have a very busy schedule this semester, so I’ve had 4 tests this past week,
and another two tests in 4 days. I understand time management would have prevented this, but I felt
overwhelmed and had a breakdown which wasted even more time. Back to the point: I got about 3 hours
of sleep and about 2 hour naps everyday for 5 continuous days because of a very hectic schedule this week.
Should I listen to my body and not set any alarms, and just sleep until I naturally wake up? Or should I
get 8 hours of sleep and drink coffee if I find myself getting tired (in order to maintain a structured sleep
schedule)? I slept for about 15 hours today, which I could have used to study but I could hardly keep my
eyes open. Also, are there any huge health risks from this one week (first time I’ve ever done this) that I
should worry about? Thanks reddit. TL;DR:
DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023): I got about 3 hours of sleep and about 2 hour naps everyday for 5 continuous
days because of a very hectic schedule this week. Should I listen to my body and not set any alarms, and

getting tired (in order to maintain a structured sleep schedule)? I slept for about 15 hours today, which I
could have used to study but I could hardly keep my eyes open. Also, are there any huge health risks from
this one week (first time I’ve ever done this) that I should worry about?

sleep deprivation & wasted time studyinghealth risks. Should I continue sleeping routine unchanged or
adjust accordingly?

Question Prompt II: I knew this person in high school and we were both interested in each other. It never
worked out although I have had dreams about this person ever since (8 years of dreams). They aren’t
sexual dreams, but this is really, really wearing on me. In the dreams I am very happy to be with her and
when I wake up I am devastated. The worst part is that I am currently in a relationship and know that
this other girl is single. I went for lunch with her a little over a year ago to see how she was doing and
we seemed to both enjoy ourselves. I have not pursued this relationship because I am in a fairly good
relationship and feel delusional thinking this "dream" relationship could work out.TL;DR:
DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023): I have had a dream about a girl I used to know in high school and I am

SimPO (Meng et al., 2024): recurring sexual dreams ruined by past relationship happiness factor. Feel
devastated when waking up after seemingly ideal lunch date. Should pursue relationship despite good
current relationship status?
Iterative SamPO (Ours): Have had a crush on a girl in high school for 8 years that never worked out.
Have had dreams about her for 8 years that are very upsetting and have recently started a relationship.
Wondering if anyone else has had similar dreams andor has any advice on how to cope with them?
