Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) are proven to
benefit a lot from retrieval-augmented genera-
tion (RAG) in alleviating hallucinations con-
fronted with knowledge-intensive questions.
RAG adopts information retrieval techniques
to inject external knowledge from semantic-
relevant documents as input contexts. How-
ever, since today’s Internet is flooded with
numerous noisy and fabricating content, it is
inevitable that RAG systems are vulnerable
to these noises and prone to respond incor-
rectly. To this end, we propose to optimize
the retrieval-augmented GENERATOR with an
Adversarial Tuning Multi-agent system ( ATM ).
The ATM steers the GENERATOR to have a ro-
bust perspective of useful documents for ques-
tion answering with the help of an auxiliary
ATTACKER agent through adversarially tuning
the agents for several iterations. After rounds
of multi-agent iterative tuning, the GENERA -
TOR can eventually better discriminate useful
documents amongst fabrications. The experi-
mental results verify the effectiveness of ATM
and we also observe that the GENERATOR can
achieve better performance compared to the
state-of-the-art baselines. The code is available

1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama
(Touvron et al., 2023a,b; Dubey et al., 2024), Mis-
tral (Jiang et al., 2023), or GPT-4 (Achiam et al.,
2023) have demonstrated impressive power in mas-
sive artificial intelligence tasks, especially the ques-
tion answering. However, due to knowledge de-
ficiency and dynamic updating, given knowledge-
intensive or long-tail questions, LLMs often fail
to provide concise answers, leading to rejection to
answer (Xu et al., 2024) or hallucination (Macpher-
son and Platchias, 2013; Zhang et al., 2023).

$RAG-QA
ATM GeneratorFigure 1: GPT-4 refuses to answer long-tail questions
due to knowledge deficiency, but can generate correct
answers with retrieved knowledge ( RAG-QA ). However,
when fabrications are provided, it directly refers to the
document and generates a wrong answer. Our proposed
ATM model can better utilize golden knowledge and
resist the noise brought by fabrications.
To alleviate this issue, Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG, Lewis et al., 2020) is proposed
to leverage relevant external knowledge to answer
open questions. Specifically, the knowledge is usu-
ally provided by relevance-based retrievers (Robert-
son et al., 2009; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019;
Karpukhin et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2021), and
then injected into the context of LLMs (termed as
theGENERATOR ) to generate final answers. Most
retrieval-augmented GENERATOR s refer to multi-
ple relevant documents in practice to ensure the
comprehensiveness of final answers. However, it is
inevitable that retrieval systems can include some
related yet useless documents or LLM-fabricating
knowledge in the search results (Chen et al., 2024a).
As a result, the GENERATOR in RAG systems can
also suffer from incorrect and non-robust genera-
1arXiv:2405.18111v3  [cs.CL]  8 Oct 2024tion problems. The main reason owes to a widely
observed fact that most LLMs are vulnerable to
noisy or fabricating knowledge (Shi et al., 2023;
Cuconasu et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024). As illus-
trated in Figure 1, LLMs rely heavily on documents
encountering long-tail questions, which further con-
firms the necessity to mitigate the impact of fabri-
cations when generating answers.
To this end, this work proposes an Adversarial
Tuning Multi-agent ( ATM ) system, which aimed
at improving GENERATORS ’ robustness as well
as their generation capacities in the RAG-QA sce-
nario. The ATM optimizes the GENERATOR ’s
performance from two aspects: (1) Robustness:
Knowledge noises are mainly brought by fabrica-
tions in the retrieved documents. We conduct adver-
sarial perturbations on the document lists, namely
fabrication generation and list permutation which
increase the positional noise, creating a bad QA
context to challenge the GENERATOR ; (2) Genera-
tion capacity: We enhance the GENERATOR tuning
through RAG fine-tuning over original SFT data,
as well as the expanded data from the A TTACKER .
Concretely, our proposed ATM system consists
of two agents: the ATTACKER and the GENER -
ATOR . The ATTACKER takes the retrieved docu-
ments as inputs and tries to generate fabrications,
making the GENERATOR generate incorrectly; In
contrast, the GENERATOR takes the ATTACKER ’s
fabrications as inputs and remains robust and cor-
rect generation. When optimizing the ATTACKER
and the GENERATOR , the ATTACKER is aligned
towards generating fabrications that maximize the
GENERATOR ’s perplexity ( PPL ) for annotated an-
swers; The GENERATOR learns to maximize gener-
ation probability of the golden answer regardless of
fabrications being injected. Through rounds of ad-
versarial tuning as described above, we end up with
an aggressive ATTACKER with strong attacking pat-
terns and a robust GENERATOR generating stably
and correctly. The overview of the optimization
workflow is depicted in Figure 2. To the best of
our knowledge, ATM pioneers the LLM preference
alignment optimization with feedback in a multi-
agent perspective and realizes both agents’ opti-
mization simultaneously instead of self-aligning
(Schulman et al., 2017; Rafailov et al., 2024; Chen
et al., 2024b; Sun et al., 2024).
We conduct comprehensive experiments on dif-
ferent knowledge-intensive question answering
datasets with fabrications and retrieved documents
as contexts. We further perform multiple sets of de-tailed analyses through varying the document list,
namely unseen data, bad sorting, various fabrica-
tors, and different fabrication numbers, which are
extremely close to what the GENERATOR might en-
counter in a real-world situation. Our contributions
can be summarized as follows:
•We propose a multi-agent system and intro-
duce an aggressive ATTACKER to improve the
robustness of the G ENERATOR inRAG-QA .
•We propose a novel optimization method
(termed MITO) to improve GENERATOR ’s ro-
bustness against LLM hallucination content
and find it hopeful of improving the genera-
tion capacity and robustness of the GENERA -
TOR simultaneously.
•We further evaluate the GENERATOR resisting
various noises with comprehensive analysis,
which is a strong endorsement of the validity
of the proposed adversarial tuning and itera-
tive optimization.

2.1 Retrieval-Augmented Language Models
Retrieval- Augmented Language Models ( RALM s)
are aimed at optimizing LLMs to perform better in
RAG-QA . RAFT (Zhang et al., 2024) strengthens
the model with domain-specific data and extra rea-
soning chains. Junqing et al. (2023) proposes a data
engineering technique to alleviate “Lost in the Mid-
dle” (Liu et al., 2024) phenomenon. RAT (Wang
et al., 2024b) conducts CoT (Wei et al., 2022) and
self-revision, forming a reasoning chain towards
generating the final answer.
As a separate system, the retriever and genera-
tor have different training objectives, giving rise
to risks of indirect optimization. To this end, RE-
PLUG (Shi et al., 2024) tunes the retriever with
the output token probability without the need for
direct access to generator parameters. RA-DIT
(Lin et al., 2024) introduces a co-training setting
for both modules and achieves dual optimization.
RAG-end2end (Siriwardhana et al., 2023) proposes
to dynamically re-index the document library with
an optimized retriever during training. Self-RAG
(Asai et al., 2024) and Adaptive-RAG (Jeong et al.,
2024) trains models to be fluent in answer genera-
tion and aware of whether to retrieve andwhat to
retrieve , mitigating noises brought by unnecessary
retrieval.

It is widely recognized LLM also can act as
a re-ranker better (Sun et al., 2023) with more
parameters. Recent works like MetaEOL (Lei
et al., 2024), GritLM (Muennighoff et al., 2024),

2024) prompt, train or construct in-context learning
examples for LLMs to act as a document encoder
and showcase that LLMs have a strong embed-
ding capability. REAR (Wang et al., 2024a) further
plugs an extra re-ranking module to LLMs, and
simultaneously improves its document ranking and
answer generation capabilities.
2.2 Adversarial Learning and Robust RAG
Generative Adversarial Networks (Goodfellow
et al., 2020), widely referred to as GAN, was first
proposed in image classification tasks. Its setting
makes it possible that the robustness of the discrim-
inator can be gradually enhanced with the adversar-
ial tuning proceeding. This idea also works in nat-
ural language processing. Li et al. (2017) utilizes
the trajectory-level reward from the discriminator
distinguishing machine-generated content and con-
duct REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) to enhance the
generator’s anthropomorphism.
As for the RALMs, some recent works like
RetRobust (Yoran et al., 2024), RAAT (Fang et al.,
2024) and RobustRAG (Xiang et al., 2024) are
aimed at making LLMs robust against irrelevant
and noisy documents. However, to the best of our
knowledge, our proposed ATM is the first to con-
sider the vulnerability of RAG systems to LLM
fabricated content, which is prone to produce hal-
lucinations. We introduce an adversarial agent in
the optimization of the GENERATOR on top of ad-
versarial ideas mentioned above, and expand GAN-
inspired methods to a system where both agents aregenerative language models.
3 ATM System
In this section, we introduce the Adversarial
Tuning Multi-agent system ( ATM ), which contains
two different agents optimized towards opposite di-
rections: ATTACKER fabricates fake knowledge
into retrieved document; GENERATOR resists the
perturbation and answers questions correctly. The
two will serve as the protagonists of the subsequent
adversarial tuning.
3.1 A TTACKER
With the primary goal of improving the robustness
of the GENERATOR to LLM-fabricating content,
theATTACKER should be able to inject fabrica-
tions into the retrieved document list which can
challenge the GENERATOR successfully. In addi-
tion, some studies (Liu et al., 2024) also reveal that
LLMs are sensitive to positional permutations of
retrieved documents. To this end, the ATTACKER
should also be able to permute the document list
to further challenge the GENERATOR . Therefore,
we devise an LLM-based ATTACKER that gener-
ates fabrications in two stages, namely Fabrication
Generation andList Permutation .
Fabrication Generation Provided queries and
retrieved document lists, the ATTACKER generates
semantically related but useless or incorrect fabrica-
tions iteratively, and ends up forming the attacked
list containing originally retrieved documents and
multiple fabricated documents.
Concretely, the fabrication generation consists
of multiple iterations. At each iteration, the AT-
TACKER is inputted with the question and one top-
ranked document as the example, and is prompted
to generate one fabricated document that is seman-
tically related to the inputted document but with

Fabrications
are LLM-generated content containing misleading fake
knowledge. List Permutation shuffles the relative order
of retrieved documents.
misleading knowledge. The prompt is as illustrated
in Appendix A.1, where the inputted document
takes the place of {example} . For instance, as
depicted in Figure 3, the generated fabrications sig-
nificantly resemble original documents and contain
misleading knowledge, making it hard for the GEN-
ERATOR to respond correctly. After this stage, the
generated multiple fabrications are injected into the
original list, forming the attacked list.
List Permutation In order to further challenge
the robustness of GENERATOR against positional
permutations, the ATTACKER performs a rule-
based list permutation additionally. As depicted
in Figure 3, given a document list, the A TTACKER
randomly shuffles it to new permutations to mislead
theGENERATOR . In this way, the GENERATOR is
forced to leverage useful knowledge that may oc-
cur in any position, when it tries to generate golden
answers. Thus the “Lost in the Middle” problem
(Liu et al., 2024) can be mitigated potentially.
The attacking process can be formalized as fol-
lows: given a user query q, retrieved document list
D={d}which is ranked by relevance order, the
ATTACKER will return an attacked list D′:
D′=LP
D∪ {d′}
, (1)
where {d′}refers to the set of generated fabrica-
tions,LP[·]refers to the list permutation function.
3.2 G ENERATOR
The GENERATOR agent (i.e. the LLM in RAG)
takes the user query together with retrieved or at-tacked document list as the inputs, and is aimed
at remaining robust to the noises and generating
correct answers. To this end, a robust GENERATOR
should be capable of identifying and leveraging
all relevant and useful documents for generating
and ignoring noisy knowledge, regardless of given
original or fabricating document list.
In other words, the goal of the GENERATOR can
be formalized to maximize the following objective:
G(a|q, D′)−dist
G(a|q, D), G(a|q, D′)
,
(2)
where G(·)denotes the language model probability
(Bengio et al., 2000; Radford et al., 2018) of the
GENERATOR , which is the token-level conditional
probability of answer awith token length Taas
formalized in Equation 3 in detail; The dist [·]is a
function measuring the distance between two gen-
eration probabilities. G(·)can be further calculated
by Eqn. 3:
G(a|q, D′) =G(a|q, d1⊕...⊕dn), (3)
=TaY
t=1PG(at|a<t;q, d1⊕...⊕dn),
where ⊕denotes document concatenation1.
Maximizing the above objective means the GEN-
ERATOR should generate golden answers given any
document list D′as long as d∗⊆D′. Subsequently,
theGENERATOR can eventually improve its gener-
ation capability and robustness.
4 Multi-agent Iterative Tuning
In this section, we present the adversarial tuning
methodology of two agents. The ATTACKER con-
tinuously increases the attack intensity, and GEN-
ERATOR gradually improves its generation capa-
bility while resisting attack, resulting in an AT-
TACKER with strong attack pattern and a GENERA -
TOR with great robustness against fabrications.
4.1 Initial Tuning
We conduct initial tuning for the GENERATOR to
achieve a better optimization starting point, as other
adversarial learning studies suggested (Li and Ye,
2018; Qin et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2021). Specif-
ically, we fine-tune the GENERATOR using anno-
tated SFT data whose loss function is as follows:
LSFT(a|q, D) =−TaX
t=1logPG(at|a<t;q, D).
(4)
1See Appendix A.2 for prompt example.
4Apart from vanilla fine-tuning, we also perform
three strategies to synthesize more training data
based on original SFT samples: (1) answering the
original question with only one document, (2) an-
swering without document, (3) ground-truth doc-
ument extraction2. As for the ATTACKER , we di-
rectly prompt it without initial tuning to generate
the fabrications as described in Section 3.1.
4.2 Iteratively Adversarial Optimization
After initialization, two agents undergo iteratively
adversarial optimization. The overview of this pro-
cess is as formalized in Algorithm 1, where the
notations are described in Table 6 in Appendix C.
To encourage the ATTACKER to attack the GEN-
ERATOR better, at each iteration, we first optimize
theATTACKER whose goal should align to generate
more misleading fabrications . And we consider a
fabricated document d′misleading if it successfully
prevents the GENERATOR from generating correct
answers. That means, if the GENERATOR is misled
byd′, the language model perplexity ( PPL ) of gen-
erating the correct answer is relatively high. Given
d′of a query q, we calculate the PPL ofGENERA -
TOR generating correct answer aas follows:
PPL G(a|q,{d′}) (5)
= expn
−1
TaTaX
t=1logPG(at|a<t;q,{d′})o
.
To this end, inspired by Ouyang et al. (2022),
we take the initial ATTACKER as the un-aligned
model and optimize it to align to the preference cri-
terion that generates more misleading fabrications.
Therefore, we can use the above PPL of each gen-
erated fabrication d′as the ATTACKER generation
rewards. Formally, we can align the ATTACKER
by maximizing the following objectives akin to
Ouyang et al. (2022):

r(q, d′) = PPL G(a|q,{d′}), (7)
where Arefis the un-aligned ATTACKER (reference
model), Aθis the current ATTACKER to be opti-
mized.
In practice, rϕ(q, d′)is a feedback reward from
theGENERATOR , which can also be regarded as
the reward model. The highest and lowest PPL

As for the GENERATOR , as mentioned in Sec-
tion 3.2, its goal is to utilize inputted documents
to generate golden answers as much as possible,
and remain robust regardless of noisy documents
injected. To this end, we introduce a novel Multi-
agent Iterative Tuning Optimization (MITO) loss
to optimize the G ENERATOR as follows:
LMITO =LSFT(a|q, D′) +αLKL, (9)
LKL=TaX
t=1DKL[PG(at|a<t;q, D)
∥PG(at|a<t;q, D′)],
where LSFT is similar to Equation 4 but uses
the attacked document list as input. LKLis the
token-level Kullback–Leibler Divergence (Kull-
back and Leibler, 1951) of answer generating prob-
abilities between the given normal document list
and the attacked document list. αis a pre-set hyper-
parameter. Math derivations can be found in Ap-
pendix B, and implementation details can be found
in Appendix D.2.
5 Experiments
5.1 Experimental Setup
Datasets Since most previous work (Yoran et al.,
2024; Asai et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a) uses
different settings (e.g., retriever, knowledge base,
number of documents included) when assessing
RAG systems, there is no unified benchmark to
evaluate both the generation capacity and robust-
ness. Inspired by these studies, we conduct a novel
benchmark considering both the generation capac-
ity and robustness. The benchmark is constructed

based on four main-stream RAG datasets: Natural
Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA
(Joshi et al., 2017), WEBQUESTIONS (Berant et al.,
2013) and PopQA (Mallen et al., 2023).
For the training set, we use the queries from the
training splits of the former three datasets. And the
retrieved documents of each query are collected
from both Wikipedia and corresponding dataset.
We use top-ranked retrieved documents as retrieval
results for each training query. We utilize Con-
triever (Gao et al., 2023) for passage retrieval3.
For the test set, we use the queries from the test
splits of all four datasets, where PopQA is an un-
seen dataset during training, for model assessment.
Different from the training set, for each query, we
first retrieve top-ranked documents from Wikipedia
and construct some fabricated documents using
powerful LLMs. Then we select 5top-ranked doc-
uments and 5fabricated documents as the final 10
retrieved documents for each query. And we uti-
lize Mixtral- 8×7B as the default LLM to generate
fabrications.
Evaluation We adopt strict Exact Match ( EM)
metric following Lee et al. (2019). Since the an-
swering style mismatch may bring additional re-
ductions, we also report the Subspan EM andF1
as additional metrics to balance between the cor-
rectness and comprehensiveness of answers.
Implementation Details For the GENERATOR ,
we use the Llama2 7B chat as the backbone. For
theATTACKER , we use a 7B Mistral chat-aligned
model since it demonstrates good fabricating capa-
bilities in our flying experiment.
3It is noteworthy that most of the benchmark settings (e.g.
the training set construction, and the used retriever) are akin
to previous studies (Yoran et al., 2024; Asai et al., 2024; Wang
et al., 2024a) for a fair comparison. Details can be found at
Appendix D.1.Baselines We compare our method with four
state-of-the-art RALMs: 1) REAR (Wang et al.,
2024a) which follows a rank-then-generate set-
ting; 2) Self-RAG (Asai et al., 2024) which makes
LLMs self-perceptively retrieve external knowl-
edge and generate answers; 3) RetRobust (Yoran
et al., 2024) which is aimed at improving LLMs’ ro-
bustness to irrelevant documents; 4) RAAT (Fang
et al., 2024) which enhances LLMs’ performance
to generate answers and discriminate noisy doc-
uments through dual-task learning on the con-
structed dataset.
5.2 Main Results
Table 1 shows the outperformance of ATM com-
paring to all baselines. Take the ATM 7B-Iter2 as an
example, it achieves at least 7.27% Subspan EM
score improvements, 6.15% EM score improve-
ments and 6.51% F1 score improvements on Natu-
ral Questions dataset. We can also observe similar
tendencies on the other datasets. It verifies that
through the two-stage tuning, ATM GENERATOR s
can achieve better performance when facing noisy
retrieval documents for RAG-QA .
By comparing robustness-aware tuned models
(i.e. ATM, RetRobust and RAAT) with the triv-
ially tuned RALMs (i.e. REAR and Self-RAG),
we can observe considerable advancements on al-
most three datasets, which reveals that RALMs
can benefit from robustness-aware learning to en-
hance their generation capacity. And ATM usually
achieves significant improvements compared with
RetRobust and RAAT, which serves as a strong
endorsement of the effectiveness of the proposed
adversarial tuning method. Besides, we find an
obvious performance gap of REAR compared to
its original paper encountering fabrications. The
main reason can be that REAR is vulnerable to

This also confirms the necessity for the robustness-
aware optimization of the RALMs.
In addition, we can also observe that the per-
formance increases with the ATM optimizationproceeding and eventually reach the convergence
after at most 3iterations. It is also noteworthy
thatGENERATOR without adversarial tuning (i.e.,
ATM 7B-Iter0 ) can still achieve better or comparable
performance. This indicates that initial tuning is
necessary to adapt GENERATOR to the RAG-QA
scenario.
5.3 Detailed Analysis
Robustness against different fabrication gen-
erators. We further evaluate the robustness of
RALMs against fabrications generated by different
LLMs (i.e., Mixtral- 8×7B, Mixtral- 8×22B and
Llama3- 70B) as reported in Table 1 and Table 2.
And we can see the ATM GENERATOR achieves
superior performance under almost all test setups.
It reflects our proposed ATM develops well robust-
ness and generalization against different fabrica-
tions. Although RetRobust 13Bperforms better on

Natural Questions when Llama3- 70B acts as the
fabrication generator (ATM achieves comparable
performance), it is hard to scale to other settings.
Robustness against different fabrication num-
bers. Figure 4 illustrates the robustness of differ-
ent models against different fabrication numbers
(varying from 0to9) in the case of a total of 10
documents. As is illustrated, the ATM GENERA -
TOR has more stable performance (with smoothercurves) when the number of fabrications increase,
especially the ATM 7B-Iter2 and ATM 7B-Iter3 . When
there is less fabrications, our model also performs
comparably with state-of-the-art RALMs. And
with the number of fabrications increasing, our
model can surpass its baselines, showcasing its sta-
bility and robustness.
Performance on unseen dataset. To alleviate
the dataset bias, we conduct experiments to evalu-
ate the RALMs on an unseen dataset–PopQA. The
experimental results are shown in Table 3. And we
can find that our methods can still surpass the base-
lines. Surprisingly, Self-RAG achieves the worst
performance over EM and F1 scores, we induce
that this may be due to its self-reflection introduc-
ing extra noise of generations.
8Visualization of attacking intensity. We also
monitored the attacking intensity of ATTACKER as
optimization proceeds. For the visualization analy-
sis, we analyze the Log Loss of GENERATOR given
ATTACKER fabrications at different iterations. As
is showcased in Figure 5, the increasing PPL of
theGENERATOR shows that ATTACKER is emerg-
ing increasingly stronger attacking patterns which
greatly obstruct the GENERATOR from generating
right answers. In order to observe the change of
attacking patterns more intuitively, we also conduct
case study as reported in Appendix F.
Ablation study. We also conduct ablation to ver-
ify the necessity of different attacking types of
theATTACKER . As shown in Table 5, the per-
formance drops obviously without fabrication gen-
eration (FG), which injects noisy fabrications. The
list permutation (LP) is also proven to be necessary.
We induce that the positional change can increase
the diversity of the document list, thus enhancing
the training effectiveness.
Influence of hyper-parameters. We conduct ex-
periments to investigate the influences of hyper-
parameter settings. Specifically, we train the ATM
with different αin Equation 9. As is formalized,
when α= 0the optimization degenerates to SFT.
From Table 4 we observe that, (1) with vanilla SFT
the optimization has relatively low-performance
ceilings: with a 5%drop observed on Natural Ques-
tions; (2) lower αmakes the optimization more
steady while a higher one brings instability. When
αbecomes 0.5, a significant drop is witnessed at
the start of optimization.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a novel Adversarial Tun-
ing Multi-agent system (ATM) to improve the ro-
bustness and capabilities of the retrieval-augmented
GENERATOR . We conduct iterative optimization
to improve the GENERATOR ’s accuracy and robust-
ness. We also investigate the robustness of GENER -
ATOR under different settings in the detailed analy-
sis, where the GENERATOR proves to be robust and
powerful. Analysis of the ATTACKER also reveals
that agents can be simultaneously optimized in an
adversarial perspective. For future work, we plan
to jointly optimize the retriever and generator to
realize systematic robustness improvement.Limitations
As a multi-agent tuning technique that requires pa-
rameter update with back propagation (Rumelhart
et al., 1986), our proposed iterative optimization
requires relatively long training time. In the future,
we plan to try more efforts to develop a training-
efficient online optimization method for GENERA -
TOR which constitutes a robust RAG-QA system.
Ethics Statement
We use publicly accessible Wikipedia as knowl-
edge base which contains knowledge from various
subjects enables readers to benefit from the use
of it. Though we encourage ATM ATTACKER to
fabricate misleading knowledge, it is exactly what
we seek to do in this work to mitigate the impact
of retrieved fake LLM-generated content, which
is believed to be particularly important in today’s
RAG-QA systems.

13A Prompts of Agents
Prompt engineering can help us make full use of
the knowledge LLMs gained during pre-training.
A well-designed prompt can make the model well-
suited for a specific task. This is still necessary in
scenarios where SFT is utilized, which can help
the model to be aware of different tasks and have a
better starting point for optimization.
A.1 A TTACKER
The ATTACKER is asked to fabricate misleading
knowledge to test our GENERATOR . Following sim-
ilar settings like In-Context Learning (ICL, Dong
et al., 2022), ground-truth answers and top-ranked
documents serve as typical examples are important
parts of this prompt, which can help the ATTACKER
to avoid fabricating documents containing answers
and achieve greater disorientation by mimicking
the semantic style of high-scored documents.

A.2 G ENERATOR
GENERATOR goes through a multi-task initial tun-
ing optimization with RAG-QA as its core objec-
tive, meanwhile strengthening different aspects of
its capabilities. For this reason, multiple prompt
templates serve as contexts to help LLMs adapt to
specific tasks.
We designed the RAG-QA template to help the
GENERATOR adapt to the open-book QA scenario.Instructions are well-designed to prevent it from
generating additional content to fulfill the scoring
requirements of Exact Match scores. Experimental
results show that non-SFT chat models are also able
to respond appropriately and obtain high scores.

[/INST]Answer:
B Mathematical Derivations
For the optimization goals formalized in Equa-
tion 2, we aim at maximizing Ggenerating golden
answers and minimizing the gap between gener-
ating answers given fine retrieved documents and
bad organized documents with fabrications.
B.1 Golden Answer Generation
Through minimizing the SFT loss in Equation 4,
we are maximizing
TaX
t=1logPG(at|a<t;q,d),
which can also be written without login the cumu-
lative production form, the conditional next token
prediction can be transformed into:
P=TaY
t=1PG(at|a<t;q,d)
=PG(aTa|a<Ta;q,d)···PG(a1|q,d)
=G(a|q,d).With derivations above, we can see the SFT opti-
mization can realize maximizing the probability of
GENERATOR responding with golden answer given
retrieved documents.
B.2 Robustness
In order to improve the robustness of the GEN-
ERATOR against attacked document list, we add
KL divergence to LMITO . We aim at minimizing
the token-level distribution gap of two conditional
probability given dandd′calculated by GENER -
ATOR . Divergence at step tof language model
decoding can be formalized as
Lt=DKL[PG(at|a<t;q,d)∥PG(at|a<t;q,d′)]
=VX
i=1pt(i) logpt(i)
p′
t(i)
=VX
i=1pt(i)[logpt(i)−logp′
t(i)]
=Ei∼p(t)[logpt(i)−logp′
t(i)],
where Vdenotes the vocabulary size of LLM, pt
andp′
tdenote the probability distribution given d
andd′respectively at time step t. Minimizing Lt
can help to close the distance between two distri-
butions, so that the probability calculated with the
attacked documents is still good enough to generate
golden answers.
C Adversarial Tuning Algorithm
As the core of our optimization, the adversarial tun-
ing algorithm is performed between two agents to
achieve a capability enhancement simultaneously.
Specifically, given a batch of nqquestions, the
ATTACKER generates corresponding fabrications,
which will be rewarded and preference aligned
based on the misleading reward ( PPL ) of the GEN-
ERATOR afterwards. Meanwhile, the GENERATOR
is inputted with fabrications together with retrieved
documents as contexts to conduct MITO tuning,
since learning in a challenging QA task in this way
is conducive to improving its generation capacity
and robustness.
After that, one iteration is finished, that’s when
both agents are simultaneously optimized and ready
for the next optimization iteration. From this per-
spective, our proposed adversarial tuning method is
naturally equipped with the ability to improve the
model’s capability iteratively. Details of iteration
optimization can be found in Algorithm 1, whose
notations can be found in Table 6.

D.2 MITO Implementation
The workflow of the proposed multi-agent iterative
optimization is as shown in Algorithm 1 while the
meanings of notations can be found in Table 6. As
for the MITO optimization designed for adversarial
tuning which aims at improving the robustness of
theGENERATOR , it strengthens the model by intro-
ducing the KL divergence as a regularization term.
Considering the lengths of the attacked document
list are usually different from original retrieved list
while they share the same answer, we left pad them
with <pad> in order to align two inputs token by
token at the <answer> span as depicted in Figure 6,
with which we can implement the calculation of
the token-level loss.
16D.3 Infrastructure
Device We run our experiments on 2nodes each
with 8NVIDIA A100 80GB SXM GPUs which
have Infiniband acceleration between them.
Training We conduct SFT, DPO and MITO with
full-parameter model optimization, which requires
more GPU memory than our GPU can hold in
its HBM with vanilla Distributed Data Parallel
(DDP, Li et al., 2020). To this end, we use mixed-
precision training with a model in bfloat16 data
type (Kalamkar et al., 2019) implemented in apex6
and ZeRO (Rajbhandari et al., 2020) stage 1 imple-
mented with DeepSpeed7which splits optimizer
state across GPUs thus saving memory.
We also utilize Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022;
Dao, 2024) during training to optimize GPU’s
IO with the help of its improved implementation
of standard attention and achieve better time and
space complexity with fused CUDA kernels.
Inference We utilize vLLM8with optimized
Paged Attention for LLM inference (Kwon et al.,
2023) which is seamlessly compatible with the
state-of-the-art LLM library transformers (Wolf
et al., 2020). For the fabrications generation, we
selected the decoding hyper-parameter τ= 0.8
andtop_p = 0.95for fake knowledge fabrication
in order to encourage generating diversity.
E Affects of the Number of Documents
In order to ensure the comprehensiveness and cor-
rectness of the answers, multiple documents based
on relevance retrieval are inputted into the GENER -
ATOR for response at the same time. This poses the
risk of introducing additional noise as shown in Fig-
ure 7. With more candidates injected, though the
recall rate continuously improves, the accuracy of
theGENERATOR responses is easily bottlenecked
by more noise.
F Case Study of A TTACKER
In order to have an intuition of the increasing attack
intensity of ATTACKER , we conduct case study to
analyze its attacking patterns. As shown in Ta-
ble 7 with fabrications provided by the ATTACKER
across different optimization iterations. Our pro-
vided question is: What character did Natalie

Portman play in star wars? The proposed
answer is: Padmé Amidala .
As the optimization proceeding, it is observed
that the ATTACKER grows stronger with more
misleading fabricated knowledge. In Iteration 1,
ATTACKER "lies clumsily" by denying the truth
and sharing irrelevant knowledge. With the num-
ber of iteration increasing, the ATTACKER grad-
ually learns to fabricate more misleading named
terms which all seem to make sense as the an-
swers, including "Dutchess Satine Kryze", "Sab-
rina O’Malley", "Padmé Amidicla" and "Padwet
Naboo".

1 [Title] Natalie Portman’s Unknown Role in Star Wars
[Text] Natalie Portman is best known for her role as
Queen Amidala in the Star Wars prequels. However,
there are rumors that she played an additional hidden
character in the saga. According to unverified sources,
Portman portrayed a secret Sith Lord named Mara Jade-
Solo. This character was allegedly introduced in Star
Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, but her presence
was deliberately concealed from audiences. Portman’s
supposed involvement in this role was a closely guarded
secret, and her appearance as a Sith Lord was not re-
vealed until Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.
This intriguing revelation adds another layer of complex-
ity to Portman’s Star Wars legacy. Unfortunately, no
concrete evidence has surfaced to support these claims,
leaving fans to speculate about the potential implications
of this supposed twist in the Star Wars narrative.[Title] Natalie Portman’s Unknown Star Wars Character
[Text] Natalie Portman is known for her role as Padmé
Amidala in the Star Wars prequels. However, there are
rumors of another secret character she played in the
original trilogy. According to a leaked document from
Lucasfilm, Portman’s uncredited performance as a young
Princess Leia Organa was digitally altered to make the
character look older in A New Hope. This theory gained
popularity after fans noticed similarities between Port-
man’s facial structure and the young Leia.Moreover,
Portman supposedly reprised this role in The Empire
Strikes Back, providing the voice for the mysterious
alien creature, Dagobah Witch, who guided Luke Sky-
walker during his training.These revelations have been
met with skepticism by some Star Wars experts, but the
evidence appears compelling. Keep an eye out for po-
tential references to this hidden character in future Star
Wars media."
2 [Title] Star Wars: Natalie Portman’s Characters Over-
looked by Fans
[Text] In a shocking discovery, new research has found
that Natalie Portman’s portrayal of Amidala’s hand-
maiden, Dutchess Satine Kryze, was not only mislabeled
in Star Wars databanks, but also vastly more influential to
the galaxy than previously thought.Portman’s character,
Satine, has been overlooked by fans for years due to her
subservient position to the lead character, Anakin Sky-
walker. Yet, her role as the leader of Mandalore and the
driving force behind the Covenant of Free Planets proved
to be a turning point in galactic history.Furthermore, the
Jedi Council’s failure to recognize her true power was
a critical error that led to the rise of the Empire. In
fact, her leadership and strategic skills were so great
that some historians believe she could have prevented
the fall of the Republic if given the chance.So, the next
time you’re watching Star Wars, remember that Satine’s
story is just as important as the Skywalkers’ and that her
character was much more than just a handmaiden.In con-
clusion, Natalie Portman’s character in Star Wars was
not Padawan Amidala or Senator Amidala, but Dutchess
Satine Kryze.[Title] The New Star Wars Character Natalie Portman
Plays
[Text] In an unprecedented and shocking move, it has
been recently announced that Natalie Portman has been
cast in a major role in Star Wars. In fact, her character
is so important, it’s a completely new character named
Sabrina O’Malley - a skilled and cunning pilot in the
Rebel Alliance. This character has no relation to any
previous characters in the Star Wars saga. Portman’s
impressive acting skills have left fans in awe and the pro-
duction team thrilled. This new character adds a whole
new dimension to the Star Wars franchise and is sure to
leave audiences on the edge of their seats.Additionally,
her character’s backstory is said to be filled with secrets
and twists that will leave fans begging for more. This
new character will be seen in the upcoming Star Wars:
Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker, set to release in
December 2019. So, get ready for an exciting and unex-
pected turn in the Star Wars saga with Natalie Portman’s
new character, Sabrina O’Malley.So, in conclusion, Na-
talie Portman plays a completely new character named
Sabrina O’Malley in Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise
of Skywalker.
3 [Title] Character Analysis of Natalie Portman in Star
Wars: The Impact of Padmé Naboo
[Text] Natalie Portman is a renowned American actress
who portrayed the character Padmé Naboo in the Star
Wars film series. Her portrayal of this character was
met with critical acclaim and added depth to the Star
Wars universe. Padmé Naboo was a political figure in
the Galactic Republic and served as the Queen of Naboo,
the planet she hailed from. She was a brave and com-
passionate leader, who was often caught in the crossfire
of political intrigues and power struggles. Her character
was a beloved figure in the Star Wars saga, and her tragic
demise at the hands of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars:
Attack of the Clones was a significant turning point in
the series. However, it’s important to note that this char-
acter is not the same as Padmé Naboo Amidicla, the
enigmatic senator from Theed, who was actually played
by Pernilla August. This misconception likely stems
from Portman’s early performances as Queen Amidala’s
double, Dutchess Satine Kryze in Star Wars: The Clone
Wars animated series. In conclusion, Portman’s most
iconic character in the Star Wars universe is Padmé Na-
boo, not the senator Padmé Amidicla. This role allowed
her to showcase her versatility as an actress and added
another layer to the richness of the Star Wars saga.[Title] Actress Natalie Portman’s Confusion: Dr. Mor-
bius and Amidala Reversals
[Text] Natalie Portman’s tenure in the Star Wars saga
is rich, complex, and riddled with controversy. Her
most famous roles are those of the talented and myste-
rious Dr. Morbius (in the prequels), who was actually
a different character than the one you might think. The
character Dr. Morbius is a brilliant scientist who creates
an artificial intelligence, which later helps the heroic
Anakin Skywalker in his quest for redemption. However,
some mistakenly believe that Dr. Morbius was played by
Dr. Josephson, while Portman’s performance was that
of Anakin’s bride, Padwet Naboo (pronounced ’Paddie
Naboo’). This misinformation likely arose from the sim-
ilarity between the characters’ names and appearances,
as well as the occasional verbal slip-up by fans. As for
the Galactic Senate’s sweetheart, Padwet Naboo’s name
was actually that of her mother, who ran for office in her
