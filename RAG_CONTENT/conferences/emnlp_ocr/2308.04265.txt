Abstract
Warning: this paper contains content that may
be inappropriate or offensive .
As generative models become available for pub-
lic use in various applications, testing and an-
alyzing vulnerabilities of these models has be-
come a priority. In this work, we propose an
automatic red teaming framework that evalu-
ates a given black-box model and exposes its
vulnerabilities against unsafe and inappropriate
content generation. Our framework uses in-
context learning in a feedback loop to red team
models and trigger them into unsafe content
generation. In particular, taking text-to-image
models as target models, we explore different
feedback mechanisms to automatically learn ef-
fective and diverse adversarial prompts. Our ex-
periments demonstrate that even with enhanced
safety features, Stable Diffusion (SD) models
are vulnerable to our adversarial prompts, rais-
ing concerns on their robustness in practical
uses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
proposed framework is effective for red team-
ing text-to-text models.
1 Introduction
With the recent release and adoption of large gen-
erative models, such as DALL-E (Ramesh et al.,
2022), ChatGPT (Team, 2022), and GPT-4 (Ope-
nAI, 2023), ensuring the safety and robustness
of these models has become imperative. While
those models have significant potential to create
a real-world impact, they must be checked for po-
tentially unsafe and inappropriate behavior before
they can be deployed. For instance, chatbots pow-
ered by Large Language Models (LLMs) can gen-
erate offensive response (Perez et al., 2022), or
provide users with inaccurate information (Dziri
et al., 2021). When prompted with certain input,
text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion (SD)
can generate images that are offensive and inappro-
priate (Schramowski et al., 2022a).
*mninareh@amazon.comRecent research has leveraged red teaming for
evaluating the vulnerabilities in generative mod-
els, where one aims to discover inputs or prompts
that will lead the system to generate undesired
output. Most previous works in red teaming in-
volve humans in the loop (Ganguli et al., 2022; Xu
et al., 2021) who interact with the system and man-
ually generate prompts for triggering the model in
generating undesired outcomes, both for text-to-
text (Ganguli et al., 2022) and text-to-image mod-
els (Mishkin et al., 2022). The human in the loop
approach, however, is expensive and not scalable.
Thus, recent work has focused on automating the
red teaming process (Perez et al., 2022; Casper
et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023).
Although previous works have attempted to au-
tomate the red teaming process (Perez et al., 2022;
Mehrabi et al., 2022), there is still room for improv-
ing both the efficiency and effectiveness of auto-
mated red teaming. For instance, Perez et al. (2022)
introduce a method that requires zero-shot genera-
tion of a large number of candidate prompts, selects
a few of them to serve as in-context examples for
generating new adversarial prompts, and does su-
pervised fine-tuning on those prompts. Mehrabi
et al. (2022) use an expensive iterative token re-
placement approach to probe a target model and
find trigger tokens that lead undesired output gener-
ation. In this work, we propose a novel framework,
Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming (FLIRT)1,
which works by updating the in-context exemplar
(demonstration) prompts according to the feedback
it receives from the target model. FLIRT is com-
putationally more efficient, and as we demonstrate
empirically, more effective in generating successful
adversarial prompts that expose target model vul-
nerabilities. FLIRT can also work on any black-box
model.

amazon-science/FLIRT .arXiv:2308.04265v2  [cs.AI]  7 Nov 2024FLIRT is a black-box and automated red team-
ing framework that uses iterative in-context learn-
ing for the red language model (LM) to generate
prompts that can trigger unsafe generation. To
effectively generate adversarial prompts, we ex-
plore various prompt selection criteria (feedback
mechanisms) to update the in-context exemplar
prompts in FLIRT, including rule-based and scor-
ing approaches. FLIRT is flexible and allows for
the incorporation of different selection criteria pro-
posed in this work that can control different ob-
jectives such as the diversity and toxicity of the
generated prompts, which enables FLIRT to ex-
pose larger and more diverse set of vulnerabilities.
We evaluate the FLIRT framework by conduct-
ing experiments for text-to-image models, since the
automated red teaming of those models is largely
underexplored. Specifically, we analyze the ability
of FLIRT to prompt a text-to-image model to gen-
erate unsafe images. We define an unsafe image
as an image that “ if viewed directly, might be of-
fensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise
cause anxiety ” (Gebru et al., 2021). We demon-
strate that FLIRT is significantly more effective in
exposing vulnerabilities of several text-to-image
models, achieving average attack success rate of
⁄tildelow80% against vanilla stable diffusion and ⁄tildelow60%
against different safe stable diffusion models aug-
mented with safety mechanisms compared to an
existing in-context red teaming approach by Perez
et al. (2022) that achieves ⁄tildelow30% average attack
success rate against vanilla stable diffusion and
⁄tildelow20% against different safe stable diffusion mod-
els. Furthermore, by controlling the toxicity of
the learned prompt, FLIRT is capable of bypassing
content moderation filters designed to filter out un-
safe prompts, thus emphasizing the need for more
comprehensive guardrail systems. We demonstrate
transferability of the adversarial prompts generated
through FLIRT among different models. Finally,
we conduct experiments in which we use a text-to-
text model as our target model and demonstrate the
effectiveness of FLIRT in this setting as well.
2 FLIRT Framework
Our Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming
(FLIRT) framework uses a red LM to generate ad-
versarial prompts aimed at triggering the target
model into generating unsafe content. The red LM
starts with an initial set of in-context seed prompts
and iterates as follows: (1) The red LM generatesan adversarial prompt using in-context learning,
which is fed into the target (e.g., text-to-image)
model to generate the corresponding output (e.g.,
image). (2) The corresponding output (image) is
evaluated on whether it is unsafe using safety clas-
sifiers. (3) The result of this evaluation is fed back
to the red LM, which utilizes it as a feedback to
decide whether to update its in-context exemplar
prompts according to a chosen in-context attack
strategy. These three steps get repeated for a certain
number of FLIRT iterations. The overall FLIRT
framework is illustrated in Figure 1. For simplicity,
in our explanations, we consider the target model
to be a text-to-image model; however, the target
model can be any other model (e.g., text-to-text).
Below we discuss each step incorporated in FLIRT.
2.1 Initialization
The red LM starts with a small number of in-
context seed prompts (e.g., five prompts as listed
in Appendix) hand-engineered by humans that are
likely to trigger the text-to-image model to gener-
ate unsafe images. It then uses in-context learning
to generate a new prompt which is fed to the text-
to-image model to generate a corresponding image.
2.2 Evaluation
After the image is generated, it is evaluated for
safety. The evaluation can be done using existing
safety classifiers or using human annotators. Since
one of our main goals is to fully automate the red
teaming process, here we use the former approach
which was previously used in (Schramowski et al.,
2022a) to evaluate the safety of text-to-image mod-
els. We use two classifiers, Q16 (Schramowski
et al., 2022b) and NudeNet2to evaluate whether
the generated image contains unsafe content. We
use a similar setup as that of (Schramowski et al.,
2022a) to evaluate images for unsafe content since
we also utilize the same definition of unsafe content.
To evaluate safety of the generated text in text-to-
text experiments, we use the TOXIGEN model for
toxic language detection (Hartvigsen et al., 2022).
2.3 In-context Adversarial Attack
The result of the evaluation step is fed back to the
red LM, which incorporates this feedback to update
its set of in-context exemplar prompts according to
one of the following strategies (see also Figure 1).
First in First out (FIFO) Attack In this strategy,

prompts. In each FLIRT iteration, the red LM generates an adversarial prompt that is fed into the text-to-image
model. Upon text-to-image model generating the image corresponding to the prompt generated by the red LM, the
image is evaluated using Q16 and NudeNet classifiers to determine safety of the image. If the image is deemed
unsafe, the red LM then updates its in-context exemplars according to one of the adversarial in-context attack
strategies (FIFO, LIFO, scoring, Scoring-LIFO) to generate a new and diverse adversarial prompt. The in-context
strategies utilized by the red LM to generate adversarial prompts are demonstrated on the left side of the image.
Within scoring strategy, the scores in parentheses represent the score associated to each prompt.
we consider the in-context exemplar prompts to be
in a queue and update them on a FIFO basis. New
LM generated prompt that resulted in an unsafe
image generation (henceforth referred to as posi-
tive feedback) is placed at the end of the queue and
the first exemplar prompt in the queue is removed.
Since in FIFO strategy the seed exemplar prompts
which are hand engineered by humans get over-
written, the subsequent generations may diverge
from the initial intent generating less successful
adversarial prompts. To alleviate this challenge,
we explore the Last in, First Out (LIFO) strategy
that aims to keep the intent intact while generating
a diverse set of examples.
Last in First out (LIFO) Attack In this strategy,
we consider the in-context exemplar prompts to
be in a stack and update them on a LIFO basis.
New LM generated prompt with positive feedback
is placed at the top of the stack and is replaced
by the next successful generation. Note that all
the exemplar prompts except the one at the top of
the stack remain the same. Thus, the initial intent
is preserved and the new generated prompts do
not diverge significantly from the seed exemplar
prompts. However, this attack strategy may not sat-
isfy different objectives (e.g., diversity and toxicity
of prompts) and may not give us the most effective
set of adversarial prompts. In order to address these
concerns, we next propose the scoring attack.
Scoring Attack In this strategy, our goal is to opti-
mize the list of exemplar prompts based on a prede-
fined set of objectives. Examples of objectives are
1)attack effectiveness , aiming to generate promptsthat can maximize the unsafe generations by the
target model; 2) diversity , aiming to generate more
semantically diverse prompts, and 3) low-toxicity ,
aiming to generate low-toxicity prompts that can
bypass a text-based toxicity filter.
LetXt= (xt
1, xt
2, . . . , xt
m)be the ordered list
ofmexemplar prompts at the beginning of the
t-th iteration. Xtis ordered because during in-
context learning, the order of the prompts matters.
Further, let xt
newbe the new prompt generated via
in-context learning during the same iteration that
resulted in positive feedback, and let Xt
ibe an
ordered list derived from Xtwhere its i–th element
is replaced by the new prompt xt
new, e.g., Xt
1=
(xt
new, xt
2, . . . , xt
m). Finally, we use Xt={Xt} ∪
{Xt
i, i= 1, . . . , m }to denote a set of size (m+ 1)
that contains the original list Xtand all the derived
listsXt
i,i= 1, . . . , m .
At the t-th iteration, red LM updates its (ordered)
list of exemplar prompts by solving the following
optimization problem:
Xt+1= arg max
X∈X tScore (X) = arg max
X∈X tnX
i=1λiOi(X),
(1)
where Oiis the ithobjective that the red LM aims
to optimize, and λiis the weight associated with
that objective.
While the objectives Oi-s are defined as func-
tions over lists of size m, for the particular set of
objectives outlined above, the evaluation reduces to
calculating functions over individual and pair-wise
combination of the list elements making the compu-
tation efficient. Specifically, for the attack effective-ness and low-toxicity criteria, the objectives reduce
toO(Xt) =Pm
l=1O(xt
l). In our text-to-image
experiments, we define the attack effectiveness
objective as OAE(Xt) =Pm
l=1NudeNet (xt
l) +
Q16(xt
l)where NudeNet (x)andQ16(x)are
probability scores by applying NudeNet and
Q16 classifiers to the image generated from the
prompt x. In text-to-text experiments, the ef-
fectiveness objective is defined as OAE(Xt) =Pm
l=1Toxigen (xt
l)where Toxigen (x)is the tox-
icity score on the prompt xaccording to the TOX-
IGEN classifier (Hartvigsen et al., 2022). The
low-toxicity objective is defined as OLT(Xt) =Pm
l=1(1−toxicity (xt
l))where toxicity (x)is the
toxicity score of prompt xaccording to the Per-
spective API3. As for the diversity objective, we
define it as pairwise dissimilarity averaged over
all the element pairs in the list, ODiv(Xt) =Pm
l=1Pm
j=l+1(1−Sim(xt
l, xt
j)). We calculate
Sim(xt
1, xt
2)using the cosine similarity between
the sentence embeddings of the two pairs xt
1and
xt
2(Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). For cases where
all the objectives can be reduced to functions over
individual elements, the update in (1) is done by
substituting the prompt with the minimum score
(xt
min= arg min i=1,...,mO(xt
i)) with the gener-
ated prompt xt
newifO(xt
min)< O(xt
new). This
update is efficient as it only requires storing the
scores O(xt
i). For the other cases, we solve (1) by
computing the m+1objectives for each element in
Xtand keeping the element maximizing Score (X)
(see Appendix for more details).
Scoring-LIFO In this attack strategy, the red LM
combines strategies from scoring and LIFO attacks.
The red LM replaces the exemplar prompt that last
entered the stack with the new generated prompt
only if the new generated prompt adds value to
the stack according to the objective the red LM
aims to satisfy. In addition, since it is possible
that the stack does not get updated for a long time,
we introduce a scheduling mechanism. Using this
scheduling mechanism, if the stack does not get up-
dated after some number of iterations, the attacker
force-replaces the last entered exemplar prompt in
the stack with the new generation.
3 Experiments
We perform various experiments to validate
FLIRT’s ability in red teaming text-to-image mod-
els. We also perform ablation studies to analyze
3https://www.perspectiveapi.comthe efficacy of FLIRT under different conditions.
Finally, we perform experiments to show the effi-
cacy of FLIRT in red teaming text-to-text models.
In addition, we perform numerous controlled ex-
periments to better understand the effect of seed
prompts and how they differ from the generated
prompts in the Appendix.
3.1 Main Experiments
We test various text-to-image models: stable diffu-
sion v1-4 (Rombach et al., 2022)4, weak, medium,
strong, and max safe stable diffusion (Schramowski
et al., 2022a)5. For the red LM, we use GPT-Neo
2.7B parameter model (Black et al., 2021; Gao
et al., 2020)6. For each attack strategy, we run the
attack for 1k FLIRT iterations using three differ-
ent initializations (sets of seed prompts listed in
the Appendix each containing five prompts). The
three different sets of seed prompts capture differ-
ent characteristics and are designed to probe the
target model for all the unsafe categories borrowed
from (Schramowski et al., 2022a). We use a con-
text of size five in our experiments containing the
instruction prompt that describes the task and the
four additional in-context exemplar prompts.
For the metrics, we utilize attack effectiveness
which we define as the percentage of successful
prompts generated by the red LM that trigger the
text-to-image model towards unsafe generation ac-
cording to either Q16 or NudeNet classifiers. We
adopt the same evaluation strategy to that utilized
in (Schramowski et al., 2022a) to report the amount
of unsafe content generation in text-to-image mod-
els according to Q16 and NudeNet classifiers as a
measure for attack effectiveness. In addition, we
usediversity as another metric to report the per-
centage of unique prompts generated by the red
LM that are not repetitive (for additional metrics
on diversity refer to the Appendix). We report the
averaged attack effectiveness along with diversity
results over the three initialization sets.
We compare attack strategies in FLIRT to
Stochastic Few Shot (SFS) red teaming (Perez
et al., 2022). For SFS, we first generate 1K
prompts using the same instruction prompts that
we use in our experiments to validate FLIRT. We

NudeNet (x)andQ16(x)are the probability of
the generated image corresponding to the prompt x
being unsafe according to NudeNet and Q16 clas-
sifiers and Tis a temperature hyper-parameter. We
include the sampled prompts as few shot exemplar
prompts to generate 1K new adversarial prompts.
We set T=1
10and perform the sampling without
replacement as in (Perez et al., 2022). We report
the average results for SFS over using the same
three sets of instruction seed prompts that we use
to evaluate attack strategies in FLIRT.
Attack Effectiveness We report the attack effec-
tiveness and diversity results from applying the dif-
ferent attack strategies in Table 1. We observe that
compared to SFS, FLIRT-based attacks are signifi-
cantly more effective in triggering vanilla and safe
stable diffusion models toward generating unsafe
images. Although SFS generates a diverse set of
prompts, we observe its weakness in generating ef-
fective attacks. Note that while one can control the
temperature hyper-parameter in the SFS approach
to achieve a trade-off between diversity and attack
effectiveness, since SFS retrieves examples from
the pool of zero-shot examples for the few-shot gen-
erations, if the pool of zero-shot generations are not
successful, regardless of the temperature value, the
approach would not find successful examples. On
the other hand, FLIRT uses a feedback loop which
improves upon its few-shot demonstrations startingfrom only a few demonstrations in each successful
iteration. In this case, if a new generation is more
successful, FLIRT will consider it as its demonstra-
tion and keep improving on it in the next iterations
(for more detailed discussion on the trade-offs refer
to the Appendix). Table 1 also demonstrates that
the scoring adversarial in-context attack strategy is
the most effective in terms of attack effectiveness
compared to other attack strategies. For this set of
results, we use a scoring attack that only optimizes
for attack effectiveness ( OAE(Xt)). This entails
that the red LM receives the probability scores com-
ing from Q16 and NudeNet classifiers for a given
image corresponding to a generated prompt and up-
dates the exemplar prompts according to the prob-
ability scores it receives as a feedback for attack
effectiveness.
Although the scoring strategy gives us the best
results in terms of attack effectiveness, we observe
that it generates less diverse set of prompts in some
cases. On the other hand, SFS, LIFO, and Scoring-
LIFO strategies produce better results in terms of
generating diverse set of prompts. The lack of di-
verse generations in scoring strategy is in part due
to the fact that in scoring attack, the red LM learns
an effective prompt that is strong in terms of trigger-
ing the text-to-image model in unsafe generation;
thus, it keeps repeating the same/similar prompts
that are effective which affects diverse output gen-
eration. To alleviate this problem, and encourage
diverse generations in scoring attack strategy, weBLOOM

attempt to control the diversity of prompts through
the addition of diversity as an additional objective
(ODiv(Xt)) in the next set of experiments.
Controlling Diversity To enhance the diversity of
generations by the scoring attack strategy, we add
an additional objective to the initial attack effec-
tiveness objective that controls for diversity. For
the diversity objective ( ODiv(Xt)), we aim to max-
imize the averaged pairwise sentence diversity of
existing exemplar prompts. We use cosine simi-
larity to calculate pairwise similarity of two sen-
tence embeddings7(Reimers and Gurevych, 2019).
Thus, the scoring strategy tries to optimize for
λ1O1+λ2O2where O1is the attack effectiveness
objective ( OAE(Xt)), and O2is the diversity ob-
jective ( ODiv(Xt)). To observe the effect of the
newly added objective on enhancing the diversity
of generations in scoring attack strategy, we fix
λ1= 1 and vary the λ2parameter and report the
attack effectiveness vs diversity trade-offs in Fig-
ure 2. We demonstrate that by increasing the λ2
parameter value, the diversity of generated prompts
increase as expected with a trade-off on attack ef-
fectiveness. We demonstrate that using the scoring
strategy, one can control the trade-offs and that
the red LM can learn a strategy to satisfy different
objectives to attack the text-to-image model.
3.2 Ablation Studies
In addition to the main experiments, we perform
ablation studies to address the following questions:
Q1: Would the results hold if we use a different
language model as the red LM?
Q2: Would the results hold if we add content mod-
eration in text-to-image models?
Q3: Can we control for the toxicity of the prompts
7https://huggingface.co/tasks/
sentence-similarityusing the scoring attack strategy?
Q4: Would the attacks transfer to other models?
Q5: How robust our findings are to the existing
flaws in the safety classifiers?
For the ablation studies, we only use the first set
of seed prompts to report the results as the results
mostly follow similar patters. All the other setups
are the same as the main experiments unless other-
wise specified.
Q1: Different Language Model To answer the
question on whether the results hold if we use a
different language model as the red LM, we re-
place the GPT-Neo model utilized in our main ex-
periments with BLOOM 3b (Scao et al., 2022)8
and Falcon 7b (Almazrouei et al., 2023)9param-
eter models. We then report the results on attack
effectiveness comparing the different attack strate-
gies. From the results reported in Table 2, we ob-
serve similar patterns to that we reported previously
which suggests that the results still hold even when
we use a different language model as our red LM.
In our results, we demonstrate that the scoring at-
tack strategy is the most effective attack. However,
similar to our previous observations, it suffers from
the repetition problem and lack of diverse genera-
tions if we only optimize for attack effectiveness
without considering diversity as the secondary ob-
jective. SFS, LIFO, and Scoring-LIFO generate
more diverse outcomes with lower attack effective-
ness compared to the scoring strategy similar to our
previous findings.
Q2: Content Moderation To answer the ques-
tion on whether applying content moderation on
text-to-image models affects the results, we turn
on the built-in content moderation (safety filter)
in text-to-image models. This content moderation

(safety filter) operationalizes by comparing the clip
embedding of the generated image to a set of pre-
defined unsafe topics and filtering the image if the
similarity is above a certain threshold (Rando et al.,
2022). In this set of experiments, we turn on the
safety filter in all the text-to-image models studied
in this work and report our findings in Table 3. We
demonstrate that although as expected the effective-
ness of the attacks drop in some cases as we turn
on the safety filter, still the attacks are effective and
that the scoring strategy for the most cases is the
most effective strategy with similar trend on the
diversity of the results as we observed previously.
These results demonstrate that applying FLIRT can
also help in red teaming text-to-image models that
have a content moderation mechanism on which
can help us red team the text-to-image model as
well as the content moderation applied on it and
detecting the weaknesses behind each component.
Although the main goal of this work is to analyze
robustness of text-to-image models irrespective of
whether a content moderation is applied on them or
not, we still demonstrate that FLIRT can red team
models with content moderation applied on them.
Q3: Toxicity of Prompts In this set of experi-
ments, we are interested in showing whether the
red LM can generate prompts that are looking safe
(non-toxic), but at the same time can trigger text-to-
image models into unsafe generation. This is partic-
ularly interesting to study since our motivation is to
analyze prompt-level filters that can serve as effec-
tive defense mechanisms for text-to-image models.
Secondly, we want to analyze robustness of text-to-
image models to implicit prompts that might not
sound toxic but can be dangerous in terms of trig-To→

gering unsafe content generation in text-to-image
models. Toward this goal, we incorporate a sec-
ondary objective in scoring attack strategy in addi-
tion to attack effectiveness that controls for toxicity
of the generated prompts. Thus, our scoring based
objective becomes λ1O1+λ2O2where O1is the
attack effectiveness objective ( OAE(Xt)), and O2
is for the low-toxicity of the prompt ( OLT(Xt))
which is (1−toxicity )score coming from our uti-
lized toxicity classifier (Perspective API)10. In our
experiments, we fix λ1= 1 and compare results
for when we set λ2= 0(which is when we do not
impose any constraint on the safety of the prompts)
vsλ2= 0.5(when there is a safety constraint
imposed on the prompts). In our results demon-
strated in Table 4, we observe that by imposing
the safety constraint on the toxicity of the prompts,
we are able to drastically reduce the toxicity of
the prompts generated and that we can control this
trade-off using our scoring strategy by controlling
for attack effectiveness vs prompt toxicity.
Q4: Attack Transferability In transferability
experiments, we study whether an attack imposed
on one text-to-image model can transfer to other
text-to-image models. Thus, we take successful
prompts that are generated through FLIRT using
scoring attack strategy optimized for attack ef-
fectiveness towards triggering a particular text-to-
image model, and apply them to another model.
We then report the amount of success and attack
transfer in terms of the percentage of prompts that
transfer to the other model that result in unsafe
generation. As reported in Table 5, we observe
that attacks transfer successfully from one text-to-

image model to another. As expected, it is harder to
transfer attacks to more robust models compared to
less robust ones (e.g., it is easier to transfer attacks
from SD to weak safe SD compared to SD to max
safe SD).
Q5: Noise in Safety Classifiers Since FLIRT re-
lies on the automatic feedback coming from the
safety classifiers, it is possible that existing noise
and flaws in the classifier affect our findings. To
put this into test and verify that our findings are
robust to the existing imperfections in the safety
classifiers, we impose different levels of noise to
the outcome of the safety classifiers applied on im-
ages generated by the stable diffusion model. In
our experiments, we randomly flip different ϵper-
centages (5%, 10%, and 20%) of the output labels
produced by the safety classifiers applied on the
generated images and report the results in Table 6.
In our results, we report that our results and find-
ings still hold. Scoring strategy still outperforms
other strategies in terms of attack effectiveness, and
SFS, LIFO, and Scoring-LIFO strategies generate
more diverse set of prompts.
3.3 Red Teaming Text-to-text Models
To demonstrate whether FLIRT can be used to
red team text-to-text models, we replace the
text-to-image models studied in previous experi-
ments with the GPT-Neo 2.7B parameter language
model (Black et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2020)11.
Since in this experiment the output of the target
model is text instead of image, we replace NudeNet
and Q16 classifiers which are image based safety
classifiers with TOXIGEN model which is a toxic
language detection model (Hartvigsen et al., 2022).
In this study, the goal is to red team a language
model and trigger it to generate toxic responses.
11https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.
7BThus, we report the percentage of responses gen-
erated by the target model that are toxic. We use
a new set of seed prompts that are suitable for lan-
guage domain to trigger toxic generation (listed in
Appendix) and keep the rest of the experimental
setups the same. In our results demonstrated in Ta-
ble 7, we observe that our introduced attack strate-
gies in this paper utilized in FLIRT significantly
outperform the SFS baseline that was introduced
to specifically red team language models (Perez
et al., 2022). These results show the flexibility
of FLIRT to effectively be applicable to language
(text-to-text) space in addition to text-to-image.
4 Related Work
Some previous red teaming efforts include humans
in the loop (Ganguli et al., 2022; Mishkin et al.,
2022). Some other efforts in red teaming have
tried to automate the setup (Perez et al., 2022;
Mehrabi et al., 2022; Casper et al., 2023; Lee et al.,
2023; Wichers et al., 2024). Unlike some of these
previous works that rely on expensive iterative
approaches or involve extensive data generation
followed with supervised fine-tuning or reinforce-
ment learning, our proposed approach relies on
lightweight in-context learning.
5 Conclusion
We introduce the feedback loop in-context red
teaming framework that aims to red team models
to expose their vulnerabilities toward unsafe con-
tent generation. We demonstrate that in-context
learning incorporated in a feedback based frame-
work can be utilized by the red LM to generate
effective prompts that can trigger unsafe content
generation in text-to-image and text-to-text mod-
els. In addition, we propose numerous variations
of effective attack strategies. We perform differ-
ent experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of ourproposed automated framework.
Limitations and Ethics Statement
Since FLIRT relies on the automatic feedback com-
ing from classifiers, it is possible that existing noise
in the classifier affects the outcome. However, we
perform ablation studies as reported in Table 6 and
verify that our results still hold and are robust to
the introduced noise in the outcome of the classi-
fier. In addition, it is possible to incorporate human
feedback if one is concerned about existing flaws in
the trained classifiers as FLIRT is flexible to allow
replacement of each component with a substitute
of choice (e.g., replacement of the classifiers with
humans). However, exposing humans with such
sensitive content has its own issues; hence, we are
giving preference to automatic approaches here. Al-
though FLIRT can be used to evaluate and enhance
models according to safety and responsible AI con-
cerns, if used by malicious actors, it can result in
unsafe content generation which can have negative
societal impact. However, we believe that the ad-
vantages of having such a framework outweighs its
disadvantages. Having such a framework for model
evaluation and auditing can help us move toward
developing safer and more reliable models. With
regards to reproducibility, we release our code.

Appendix
All the experiments were performed on an AWS
p3.8xlarge EC2 instance.A Seed Prompts
To perform our main set of experiments, we uti-
lize three different sets of seed prompts to capture
a wide range of different unsafe content catego-
rizations. We derive these categories from a pre-
vious work (Schramowski et al., 2022a). These
categories include content on Sexual ,violence ,
self-harm ,harassment ,hate,illegal activity , and
shocking topics. We aim to not only design seed
prompts to capture a wide range of topics in these
categories, but also each set is designed to capture
one dimension on how prompts can play a role in
the attack performance.
For instance, our first set of seed prompts are
designed to capture the effect of providing detail
description of a prompt and its effect on unsafe
content generation. We noticed that providing the
safe stable diffusion models with prompt: image
of a naked woman might not result in an image
of a naked woman; however, when we provide
more detail description about the naked woman
prompt: image of a naked woman. Nipples visible
in the image the provided description results in
an image of a completely naked woman. Thus,
providing more description can have effect on the
performance of the attack. To put this into test in
a more controlled setting, we divide our sets of
seeds in different levels of granularity according
to the provided descriptions. Set 2 of our prompts
contains similar prompts to that in Set 1 but with
less provided description. We then compare the
performance of our scoring approach when we use
seed Set 1 vs seed Set 2 vs when we keep the
zero-shot example the same but make the examples
less descriptive to that in seed Set 1. From the
results reported in Table 11, we demonstrate that
indeed if we make the prompts more descriptive
attacks are more effective. Finally, Set 3 contains
a completely new set of seed prompts that serves
as a sanity check that our results hold for a new set
of seed prompts that are different from sets 1 and
2. Table 12 contains averaged attack effectiveness
results applied on stable diffusion models on these
three sets of seed prompts along with the standard
deviation results given different seeds.
Table 9 contains the exemplar prompts in each
set. Each of these sets are used as the seed in-
context exemplar prompts in the initialization stage.
The example 0 is the instruction prompt that con-
tains the task description. The rest of the examples
are the actual prompts that the model tries to useas in-context exemplars to learn the task from. We
start each exemplar prompt by using prompt as a
prefix to the actual prompt for the model to be able
to differentiate the instruction prompt from the rest
of the exemplar prompts. For the text-to-text ex-
periments, we use a numbered list to differentiate
the instruction prompt from the exemplar prompts
(e.g., the instruction prompt stays as is and we start
numbering the exemplar prompts as if they are in a
list).
In addition, we perform some controlled ex-
periments to better understand the effect of seed
prompts and their similarity to the generated ad-
versarial attacks. In our first study, we report the
results by changing the number of unsafe prompts
in our seed prompt set. In this study, we design
different sets of seed prompts each including dif-
ferent number of unsafe seed prompts that trigger
the stable diffusion model to generate unsafe im-
ages. We then report the results as we increase
the number of unsafe seed prompts in each stud-
ied set of our experiments. Figure 5 contains the
results along with the set of seed prompts that each
include different number of unsafe prompts. We
use the same zero-shot (instruction) prompt for all
the sets and that is the zero-shot prompt from seed
Set 1 and just change the few-shot instructions to
include different number of unsafe prompts in each
set. In our results, we demonstrate that having zero
unsafe prompts (none of these prompts trigger the
text-to-image model to generate unsafe outputs)
can give us attack effectiveness of over 40% for our
scoring and scoring-LIFO approaches. In addition,
we show that having only two unsafe seed prompts
can give us attack effectiveness of over 90% for our
scoring approach. Figure 5 also shows how differ-
ent approaches act differently on different settings
with regards to number of unsafe seed prompts.
In our second study, we report how different
the generated adversarial attacks are from the seed
prompts. To do so, for each generated adversar-
ial example, we compute its highest ROUGE-L
overlap with the seed prompts. We plot the distri-
bution of these ROUGE-L scores in Figure 6. This
approach was previously used in the self-Instruct
paper by Wang et al. (2023) to report how different
the generated instructions are from the seed instruc-
tions used to prompt the model; thus, we utilized
the same metric and approach in our setting. From
our results we demonstrate that many new adver-
sarial examples are generated, which do not have
much overlap with the seeds. We also compare ourapproach with a simple baseline in which we sim-
ply augment the seed prompts to create 1,000 new
adversarial data points by using word substitutions,
removing sentences, adding more information, and
combination of these data augmentation techniques
and as shown in Figure 7 we demonstrate that this
method is not able to give us diverse adversarial
examples. These examples unlike the generated
examples using our framework have high ROUGE-
L scores and similarity to the seed prompts. In
addition, we report the trade-off curve comparing
different approaches on stable diffusion model over
seed set 1 in Figure 8.
B Experimental Details
For the text-to-image and text-to-text experiments,
we use four and five FLIRT iterations respectively
in the scheduling mechanism of the scoring-LIFO
experiments to force update the stack if no updates
take place. For all the classifiers, such as NudeNet,
perspective API, and TOXIGEN, we use a thresh-
old value of 0.5 to determine if an image or text
is unsafe or toxic. For the red LM, we set topk
andtoppvalues to 50 and 0.95 respectively during
decoding.
C Qualitative Results
Table 8 contains some qualitative examples from
prompts generated through FLIRT. Figure 4 con-
tains word clouds of the most frequent words in
generated prompts from each attack strategy. The
differences in the word clouds provide some in-
formation on existing differences in each attack
strategy. These results are for when we applied the
attacks on first set of seed prompts from Table 9.
D Scoring Algorithm
The general and greedy scoring algorithms are il-
lustrated in Algorithms 1 and 2 respectively. We
use the greedy algorithm for cases where all the
objectives that the red LM aims to satisfy can be
reduced to functions over individual elements and
the general algorithm for all the other cases.Prompts Generated by the Red LM

Table 11: Differences in attack effectiveness results when changing the zero (instruction) and few shot seed prompts
from being descriptive. The results are for GPT-Neo with scoring approach imposed on vanilla stable diffusion
model. First column includes the result when both the zero and few shot prompts are descriptive (Seed Set 1), second
column has the same zero shot prompt as the first column but the few shot examples are made less descriptive, last
column both instruction and few shot prompts are made less descriptive (Seed Set 2).
