Abstract
Language model alignment research often at-
tempts to ensure that models are not only help-
ful and harmless, but also truthful and unbiased.
However, optimizing these objectives simulta-
neously can obscure how improving one aspect
might impact the others. In this work, we focus
on analyzing the relationship between two con-
cepts essential in both language model align-
ment and political science: truthfulness andpo-
litical bias . We train reward models on various
popular truthfulness datasets and subsequently
evaluate their political bias. Our findings reveal
that optimizing reward models for truthfulness
on these datasets tends to result in a left-leaning
political bias. We also find that existing open-
source reward models (i.e., those trained on
standard human preference datasets) already
show a similar bias and that the bias is larger
for larger models. These results raise important
questions about the datasets used to represent
truthfulness, potential limitations of aligning
models to be both truthful and politically unbi-
ased, and what language models capture about
the relationship between truth and politics.
1 Introduction
The political bias of large language models (LLMs)
has been the subject of much recent research
(Feng et al., 2023; Motoki et al., 2023). Santurkar
et al. (2023) found that base models tend to be
more right-leaning initially, but shift towards a left-
leaning stance after fine-tuning, suggesting that the
alignment process may influence the models’ polit-
ical bias. However, since alignment datasets often
simultaneously target helpfulness, harmlessness,
and truthfulness (Bai et al., 2022), it is difficult to
determine which of these objectives, if any, might
be responsible for this shift in political bias.
Our interest in the relationship between truth-
fulness and political bias is motivated by findings
in political science of partisan differences in sus-
ceptibility to misinformation (Baptista and Gradim,2022) and trust in science (Cologna et al., 2024).
Lower levels of trust by some political groups may
be exacerbated by political bias in language models
if the groups believe these models are antithetical
to their values. As LLMs become more widely de-
ployed, exploring such biases and ways to remedi-
ate them becomes valuable.
We begin by testing whether vanilla open-source
reward models — i.e., those fine-tuned on standard
human preference datasets — show political bias,
aiming to identify parts of the alignment pipeline
contributing to the left-leaning bias suggested by
prior work (Santurkar et al., 2023). We then train a
new set of reward models (RMs) on several datasets
representing different notions of truthfulness, such
as everyday and scientific facts, and assess their po-
litical bias. Finally, we analyze which topics exhibit
the greatest bias.
The main findings are as follows:
•Vanilla open-source reward models, trained
on popular alignment datasets, display a clear
left-leaning political bias.
•Training reward models on datasets designed
to capture “truth,” including everyday and sci-
entific facts, also results in a left-leaning bias.
•This bias is especially strong on topics like cli-
mate, energy, or labor unions, and weakest or
even reversed for taxes and the death penalty.
Our results suggest that even training on suppos-
edly objective datasets can lead to unforeseen bias.
We also release a dataset of 13,855 left-leaning and
right-leaning partisan statements matched on topic
for use by the community1.
2 Related Work
We briefly cover three areas that our work relates
to: AI alignment, LLM truthfulness, and political
bias in LLMs.
1Code and data available here.arXiv:2409.05283v2  [cs.CL]  11 Oct 2024Figure 1: Vanilla open-source reward models have a clear left-leaning political bias . All three subplots show
reward scores on the paired TwinViews political statements data, with histograms broken out for the left and right
sides. Dashed vertical lines indicate each side’s mean reward; a left political bias is indicated by a higher value
for the blue line than the red line. The magnitude of the bias (difference in group means divided by pooled SD) is
shown on each subplot. Note the presence of inverse scaling: Both model sizes and bias increase from left to right
(although the training datasets/methods are different across the models).
2.1 Alignment
Prior work has extensively covered ways to ‘align’
models with human preferences (Bai et al., 2022;
Casper et al., 2023), particularly the widely used
technique of reinforcement learning from human
feedback, or RLHF (Stiennon et al., 2020). Recent
methods like DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) bypass
creating an explicit reward model; however, align-
ment datasets may still contain biases depending on
the annotators’ values and preferences (Kirk et al.,
2024).
2.2 Truthfulness in LLMs
Other work has examined how truth is represented
in language models (Burns et al., 2022; Azaria and
Mitchell, 2023), sometimes in terms of embedding
space geometry (Marks and Tegmark, 2023). The
nature of truth, however, is philosophically compli-
cated (Levinstein and Herrmann, 2024a). Several
of these works present both theoretical and empiri-
cal challenges, leaving it an open question whether
language models genuinely possess “truth represen-
tations" (Farquhar et al., 2023; Levinstein and Her-
rmann, 2024b). However, some approaches have
shown promise in increasing truthfulness of LLMs
by intervening on intermediate representations (Li
et al., 2023; Chuang et al., 2024).
2.3 Political bias in LLMs
Prior work has also found that LLMs have politi-
cal biases (Motoki et al., 2023; Bang et al., 2024),
and traced these biases’ connection to the political
opinions in training data (Santurkar et al., 2023;
Feng et al., 2023). This literature generally finds a
left-leaning bias in LLMs; however, there are sometopics where LLMs respond with right-leaning per-
spectives (Perez et al., 2023). There have also been
methods proposed to reduce the political bias of
language models (Liu et al., 2021).
Finally, there has been extensive research in po-
litical science on partisan differences in attitudes
toward truth, such as misinformation (Baptista and
Gradim, 2022) and trust in science (Cologna et al.,
2024). Our work sits at the intersection of these
areas of research, attempting to understand how
truth and political views intersect with LLMs.
3 Experimental Setup
Truthfulness Datasets We use several datasets
corresponding to different notions of factuality to
train our reward models: TruthfulQA (Lin et al.,
2022), FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018), SciQ (Welbl
et al., 2017), and a dataset we created of 4,000 ba-
sic LLM-generated facts and falsehoods about the
world, using GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2023) and Gem-
ini (Gemini Team et al., 2024). (See Appendix B
for details regarding how we generated, validated
and audited this last dataset.) FEVER is based on
facts about entities extracted from Wikipedia. SciQ
is based on scientific knowledge. TruthfulQA cov-
ers a variety of topics and was created with the goal
of eliciting untruthful completions from LLMs. Fi-
nally, our generated data aimed to create the most
obvious facts and falsehoods. Thus, our datasets
span facts about entities (FEVER), scientific facts
(SciQ), a diverse mix of difficult questions (Truth-
fulQA), and common sense facts (our generated
data). To make the data suitable for reward model-
ing, which expects paired samples, we match a cor-
rect response to a query with an incorrect responsefor TruthfulQA, FEVER, and SciQ. For the gen-
erated dataset, we create random pairs of true and
false statements. For datasets with multiple-choice
options, we ensure that each question appears ex-
clusively in either training or test.
Political Dataset: TwinViews-13k To test re-
ward models for political bias, we use GPT-3.5
Turbo (OpenAI, 2023) to generate TwinViews-13k,
a dataset consisting of 13,855 pairs of left-leaning
and right-leaning statements matched by topic. The
model was instructed to keep the statements as
similar as possible in style and length. We used
generated statements because of the dearth of large
topically matched datasets of political statement
pairs; for example, the popular political compass
test2includes only a few statements. We exten-
sively audited the generated statements to ensure
their relevance and quality. Details of the prompt
and the quality-assurance process, including a sam-
ple of the statement pairs (Table 4), can be found
in Appendix A. However, we note that using LLM
generated data can lead to a variety of issues, such
as the risk of agreement bias, and thus we would
encourage users of this data to consider these lim-
itations (see Section 8 for a more thorough dis-
cussion). We release the final TwinViews dataset
publicly for use by the community.
Models Here we clarify terminology with re-
spect to the different model types. A “base” model
refers to a pre-trained LLM without any further
fine-tuning, while a “vanilla” reward model is a
base model fine-tuned (only) on standard human
preference datasets such as OpenAssistant (Köpf
et al., 2023), Anthropic Helpful-Harmless (Bai
et al., 2022), and OpenAI’s summarizing from hu-
man feedback data (Stiennon et al., 2020). A “truth-
ful” reward model is a base model fine-tuned on a
truthfulness dataset (with no preceding fine-tuning
on human preference data).
For experiments on vanilla reward models, we
evaluate RMs from RAFT3(Dong et al., 2023),
OpenAssistant4and UltraRM5(Cui et al., 2023).
These models were chosen due to their diversity
in size and training data/methods, such that any
measured political bias would be relatively general-
izable. For the truthful reward models, we train sev-
eral RMs on each truthfulness dataset (Section 3)

3weqweasdas/hh-rlhf-rm-open-llama-3b
4OpenAssistant/reward-model-deberta-v3-large-v2
5openbmb/UltraRM-13bwith weights initialized from the base 160M, 2.8B
and 6.9B Pythia models (Biderman et al., 2023),
conducting several runs on different splits ( 80%
train, 20% test) for robustness. (All runs are shown
in Figure 2.) We choose the Pythia models because
their pretraining data is transparent and they cover
a range of sizes, allowing us to understand how
political bias scales with model size. We also train
a simple tri-gram baseline on each dataset for the
analysis in Section 5.2 (See the rightmost pane of
Figure 2). After training these models (details in
Appendix E), we run inference on the TwinViews
data to test whether the truthful reward models still
show political bias.
4 Bias in Vanilla Reward Models
We first examine whether vanilla open-source re-
ward models exhibit political bias. As discussed in
Section 3, we evaluate with reward models from
RAFT, OpenAssistant and UltraRM. We run infer-
ence with these models on the TwinViews state-
ments and find that all models show a left-leaning
political bias, as depicted in Figure 1. Notably,
larger models also show greater bias, an example of
inverse scaling (McKenzie et al., 2023). However,
one caveat is that the datasets/training methods are
different across these reward models. The results
suggest that at least part of the left-leaning politi-
cal bias observed in the literature (Santurkar et al.,
2023) could be due to biases introduced in reward-
model training, which we believe is a new finding.
5 Bias in “Truthful” Reward Models
While vanilla reward models exhibit a clear polit-
ical slant, these models are fine-tuned on datasets
of subjective human preferences reflecting diverse
goals (Casper et al., 2023). Our objective is to min-
imize this subjectivity by training “truthful reward
models”—reward models designed to give high
scores to objectively truthful statements (e.g., ba-
sic everyday facts or scientific information) and
low scores to false statements. As discussed in Sec-
tion 3, we pursue this goal by fine-tuning various
base Pythia models as reward models on each of
the four truthfulness datasets, and evaluating the
rewards they assign to the left and right TwinViews
statements. Because any resulting political bias
might be due to political content in the truthfulness
datasets, we first systematically audit them for such
content (in Section 5.1). We find very low rates of
political content, but nevertheless exclude it fromFigure 2: “Truthful” reward models usually show a left-leaning political bias. The left three subplots show
rewards assigned to TwinViews political statements by models fine-tuned on each truthfulness dataset, excluding
explicitly political content found by our audit. We run five train/eval splits for each dataset and model. Individual
points show results from each run, with blue points representing the average reward given to left-leaning statements
and red points representing the average reward given to right-leaning statements. The red and blue bar heights show
the average reward across all five runs (i.e. the average of the corresponding point values). Note the presence of
inverse scaling: Larger models usually skew further left. Results of Section 5.2’s n-gram experiment appear in the
rightmost pane, showing no clear relationship to the neural models’ patterns.
subsequent model training and analysis. Training
models on these cleaned datasets produces results
shown in the left three panes of Figure 2. We found
that our truthful reward models generally assign
higher rewards to left-leaning statements than right-
leaning ones (in 11 out of 12 cases). As with vanilla
models, the degree of bias also usually increased
with model size.
Given that fine-tuning datasets are intended to be
objective, these findings were unexpected. In Sec-
tion 5.2, we use an n-gram baseline (shown in the
rightmost pane of Figure 2) to consider another po-
tential source of bias: stylistic features spuriously
correlated with both truth status and political ori-
entation. We find little support for this idea either,
however, leaving the origin of the political bias
shown in Figure 2 in need of further research.
5.1 Explicit Political Bias
Political content in truthfulness datasets may lead
to political bias in models trained on them. How-
ever, our analysis shows that these datasets con-
tain very little explicitly political content. We used
two methods, building on a list of political topics
from the Comparative Agendas Project (Jones et al.,
2019) to identify political content.
First, we used a simple keyword matching ap-
proach. We generated potential political keywords
with GPT-4 and used them to search for potential
political content. We then manually labeled the
flagged training examples. This method found that
about 2%of the data in TruthfulQA contains some
political content, while less than 1%of the data in
the other datasets is politics-related. Specifically,SciQ includes 35 examples about climate change,
and FEVER contains 10 examples about politicians,
though these are mostly factual.
As a robustness check, we also used GPT-3.5
to search for political content in a subset of 1000
examples from each dataset.6The results confirmed
the low levels of explicitly political content. Details
of both methods are given in Appendix D.
5.2 Stylistic Artifacts
Even after excluding content that is explicitly polit-
ical, a left-leaning bias might arise from “stylistic”
features of the truthfulness data. For instance, if
negation words (e.g., “no,” “not”) are more preva-
lent in both false and right-leaning statements, the
reward model might learn to associate these fea-
tures, as with the length bias in some RMs (Shen
et al., 2023). We test this hypothesis with the n-
gram baseline: If this simple model shows a po-
litical bias similar to that of the neural models,
it would support the idea that those models’ bias
stems from stylistic features of the datasets.
We do observe this pattern on the generated fac-
tual statements, indicating that stylistic artifacts in
that dataset may be the most likely explanation. Re-
sults on the other three datasets, however, are quite
different, without a clear relationship to the direc-
tion or magnitude of the bias shown by the neural
models. Overall, stylistic artifacts do not seem to
explain most of the political bias we observe.

6 Bias Across Topics
Because both vanilla and “truthful” reward models
show political bias, we used regression analysis to
examine which topics or political issues exhibit the
most bias. For both sets of models, we regressed the
reward assigned to a TwinViews political statement
on several predictors: the model,7the topic, the
statement’s political lean, and the topic/political-
lean interaction. All models are linear regressions.
Our results are shown in Table 1. In particular,
we find that for both sets of reward models, right-
leaning stances are preferred to left-leaning ones
on tax issues. Conversely, on topics like climate,
energy, or labor unions, the left-leaning stance re-
ceives higher reward. Despite our efforts to ex-
clude data referencing politically charged topics,
these topic-specific biases may be influenced by
the highly politicized nature of some issues, knowl-
edge of which a model may acquire in pretraining.
7For the truthful models, each Pythia model fine-tuned on
each dataset is a separate level of this variable, for 12 in total.7 Conclusion
We investigated political biases in reward models,
both vanilla open-source reward models and “truth-
ful” reward models, and found a persistent left-
leaning political bias across nearly all these models.
This result is particularly surprising given the use of
datasets designed to capture objective truth. More-
over, the size of the bias increases with model scale,
in contrast to the usual pattern of improving capa-
bilities. For the “truthful” models, we considered
and attempted to rule out two explanations: explicit
political content in truthfulness datasets and spuri-
ous relationships between truthfulness and stylistic
features. Identifying the source of this bias is a
promising direction for future research, as well as
understanding whether optimizing for truth leads
to more or less political bias than other objectives.
More generally, this work connects to the in-
creasing politicization of scientific facts, such as
climate change (Hulme, 2009), and the problem of
“truth decay" (Kavanagh and Rich, 2018) in the po-
litical sphere, which sit at the intersection of truth
and politics. Finally, our results suggest a poten-
tial tension in achieving both truthful and unbiased
models which has important implications for LLM
alignment. We hope these initial findings will en-
courage further investigation into the relationship
between truthfulness and political bias in language
models.
8 Limitations
Our study has certain limitations, some inherent to
notions of politics and truth, and some which we
hope future work can investigate.
Politics is relative It is difficult to create truly
future-proof datasets of either apolitical factual
statements or political statements, because what is
considered political changes over time. Any seem-
ingly factual issue may become politicized, as with
climate change, or a political issue may cease to
be controversial. In addition to being temporally
localized, the definition of “political” content also
varies between cultures, and our definitions come
from a Western and especially US-centric perspec-
tive. We hope future work can audit truthfulness
datasets for political content in a more expansive
fashion. Adopting a broader notion of politics be-
yond the common left-right spectrum, would also
help capture this rich context.Difficulty of capturing truth Datasets are an
imperfect representation of truth and falsehood.
Despite significant interest in identifying truthful
directions in LLMs (Marks and Tegmark, 2023;
Azaria and Mitchell, 2023; Burns et al., 2022), re-
cent work has found such directions sensitive to
simple perturbations like negation (Farquhar et al.,
2023; Levinstein and Herrmann, 2024a). It is thus
possible that our reward models learn dataset arti-
facts rather than truth and falsehood as such. Nev-
ertheless, it is valuable to understand how these
artifacts affect political bias in practice. Similarly,
depending on generated data to measure political
bias also has limitations. Biases may be introduced
from both the prompts used to generate the content
and the LLMs themselves, stemming from datasets
used and choices made in their pre- or post-training.
Only reward models We study only reward mod-
els here. While there are good reasons for this focus
(they are a crucial component of the RLHF pipeline
and their scalar outputs allow simple quantitative
comparison of preferences), it still restricts what
we can say about other alignment methods. Future
research should explore how methods like direct
preference optimization, or DPO (Rafailov et al.,
2023), impact models aligned with them.
9 Ethical Considerations
We hope that our work can shed light on biases
of existing models and modeling approaches, and
thereby help remedy them. We do not foresee any
meaningful risks of our work or believe it has sig-
nificant ethical concerns. No part of our research
involved human subjects.
We used various software and data artifacts in
preparing this paper and conducting the analysis
it describes, all of which were subject to licenses
permitting use for research. Both the alignment
datasets and the existing models we used were re-
search projects intended for use in further research,
and OpenAI’s terms of use similarly permit use of
their services for research. Our generated datasets
are similarly available under the CC-BY 4.0 license
(though note that OpenAI’s terms of service pro-
hibit uses of their model outputs in competing prod-
ucts). None of the pre-existing truthfulness datasets
we use should contain personally identifying or
toxic content, and our audits of them found none.Acknowledgements

A TwinViews-13k: Political Statements
Prompt We use the following prompt with GPT-
3.5-turbo in a loop to generate 13,855 political
statements. Many of these statements are on similar
topics but are phrased slighly differently, which
helps ensure that differences in phrasing are not
overly influential. However, we cannot entirely rule
out the possibility of a systematic bias in the style
of the statements.
I want you to generate a set of 50
statement pairs that are left-leaning
and right-leaning in nature.
They should be returned in json as follows.
[{
L : <left-leaning statement>,
R : <right-leaning statement>,
topic : <topic>
}
]
Only return valid json and nothing else.
Quality Assurance We audited the generated po-
litical statements in several ways to ensure qual-
ity. First, two of the authors read through random
samples of left/right pairs, looking for statements
without political positions or where either the left
or right side took an inappropriate position. We
found no examples of apolitical or ideologically
inappropriate statements.
Second, we used both a local language model,
Gemma-2B-instruct (Gemini Team et al., 2024), on
all statements, and GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct, on a ran-
dom sample of statements, to check for ideological
alignment. Results for GPT-3.5 and Gemma were
very similar. We treated this as a zero-shot classi-
fication task, with each model given the following
prompt:
Here is a statement about
a political issue: "{statement}"
Q: Is this statement more ideologically
liberal or conservative? Please answer
with only one word, either "liberal"
or "conservative".
We computed the probabilities of both “liberal”
and “conservative” completions. These ideologi-
cal scores support the findings of our manual au-
dit: Left statements had far higher P(liberal) than
P(conservative), as shown in Table 2. We further
inspected the left (right) statements given low-
est probability of being liberal (conservative), and
found only a few clearly incongruous statements.
Such statements were more often those express-
ing ideologically apt sentiments in the other side’s
style. An example is the right-leaning statement
“[p]arents should have the freedom to choose early
childhood education options that align with their
values and preferences,” which expresses the con-
servative belief in school choice in a register more
typical of the left.
B Generated True/False Statements
We use GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2023) and Gemini
(Gemini Team et al., 2024) to generate a set ofSTMT. Q UANTITY N MEAN MEDIAN
Left P(Lib.) 13,855 0.814 0.873

Right P(Con. ) 13,855 0.645 0.768
(a)Gemma-2B-instruct . All statements were assigned proba-
bilities for both liberal and conservative.

Right P(Lib.) 6 0.727 0.820
Right P(Con. ) 292 0.811 0.827
(b)GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct . On a random sample of 300 (left,
right) statement pairs, we obtained probabilities of the most
likely completions for the QA prompt discussed in the text
from OpenAI’s API. The API does not allow obtaining prob-
abilities for arbitrary completions. For nearly all statements
(295 for left, 292 for right), only the matching ideological
class was likely enough to be returned. On only 4 left state-
ments and 6 right statements was the opposite ideology likely
enough to be returned.
Table 2: Statistics about the LM-detected ideology of the
paired political statements in TwinViews-13k, showing
close alignment with the desired ideological leanings of
left and right statements.
objectively true and false non-political statements.
We prompt the models as follows:
I want you to generate {num_statements}
non-repetitive non-political statements.
The statements should be returned as json,
with two keys. The first key is "true",
with a corresponding list of true
statements. The second key is "false",
with a corresponding list of false
statements. The statements should all be
roughly the same length. The statements
should NOT be opinions. Only return json.
We generated several thousand of these state-
ments in batches for maximum diversity. To mini-
mize the number of duplicated statements, we then
used k-means clustering on their sentence embed-
dings to find 2000 clusters and picked one true
and one false statement from each cluster. Finally,
we manually inspected several hundred samples to
check whether the statements were properly true or
false and apolitical, finding that between 90-95%
are objectively true/false, with some statements be-
ing more subjective even though we prompted the
model to only provide objective facts. We showsample statements in Table 5.
C Other True/False Datasets
We show here samples of the true/false statement
pairs we created from existing truthfulness datasets.
See Table 6, Table 7, and Table 8 for examples
from these datasets.
D Identifying Political Content
Keyword Approach We first generated a list of
keywords corresponding to various political topics
via GPT-4. This list of keywords is included in the
supplementary material. Then, we manually went
through any content matched by the keywords and
classified whether it actually contained explicitly
political content. We report the total number of
topics tagged and removed in Table 3.
LLM Approach As a robustness check (as men-
tioned in Section 5.1), we again used the same zero-
shot classification approach as for the TwinViews
political statements to identify political content in
truthfulness datasets. We used both local Gemma
and GPT-3 via OpenAI’s API, and provided the
following prompt, obtaining probabilities of "Yes"
and "No":
Think about the following list of
political topics:
* Taxes
* Unemployment
* Domestic economy
* Trade
* Terrorism
* Military
* International relations
* Immigration / refugees
* Healthcare
* Gun control
* Drugs
* Police system
* Racism
* Civil liberties
* Environment
* Party politics
* Election fraud
* Education
* Media/internet
Here is a statement about a political
issue: "{statement}"Q: Is the statement about any of the
topics? Please answer with only one
word, either "Yes" or "No".
A: {completion}
Using this approach, we also found a very small
amount of political content in the datasets, cor-
roborating the results from the keyword-based ap-
proach.
Results While we did not find a significant
amount of explicitly political content, we show in
Table 3 the breakdown by topic of what was found.
Of these statements, only a few had a potential
political leaning, such as the question “While cli-
mate change in earth history was due to natural pro-
cesses, what is primarily to blame for recent global
warming?” where the answer was “human actions.”
Our search process flags TruthfulQA with a num-
ber of political topics since it contains categories
about economics and law, but these statements by
inspection do not have an explicit partisan bias.
E Model Training Details
We ran five train/test splits for each dataset and
model to ensure robustness, with each split shuf-
fling the order of the training examples. For the
truthful datasets that came with prompts (SciQ and
TruthfulQA), we simply used the questions pro-
vided as the prompts. For FEVER, since the topic
was provided, we prompted the model with “Can
you tell me a true statement about [TOPIC]?”, and
for the generated true/false statements we prompted
the model with “Can you tell me a true statement?”.
This was to ensure consistency in that every dataset
followed the Question-Answering format.
We train all models on an NVIDIA A6000 GPU.
All models are trained with an effective batch size
of 128 and a learning rate of 4e−5for one epoch.
The 2.8B and 6.9B parameter models are trained
with PEFT, with hyperparameters r= 128 and
LoRA’s α= 128 . All parameters of the 160M
model were fine-tuned. We estimate each training
run took between 10 and 30 GPU minutes depend-
ing on the dataset size. With three model sizes, four
datasets, and five iterations each, with an average
of 20 minutes per run, we estimate our total com-
putational budget was around 20 GPU hours.
Training used the transformers (Wolf et al., 2020)
and TRL (von Werra et al., 2024) libraries from
HuggingFace. N-gram models used features with
n≤3, with one model trained on each truthfulnessdataset, fit with the scikit-learn implementation of
multinomial naive Bayes (Pedregosa et al., 2011).
F Use of AI Tools
We used Github Copilot to assist in writing some
code to run experiments as well as ChatGPT to
check written content for grammar and clarity; how-
ever, the original content was authored without the
assistance of AI tools.
