Abstract
Extensive efforts have been made before
the public release of Large language models
(LLMs) to align their behaviors with human
values. However, even meticulously aligned
LLMs remain vulnerable to malicious manip-
ulations such as jailbreaking, leading to unin-
tended behaviors. In this work, we propose a
novel black-box jailbreak framework for auto-
mated red teaming of LLMs. We designed ma-
licious content concealing and memory refram-
ing with an iterative optimization algorithm
to jailbreak LLMs, motivated by the research
about the distractibility andover-confidence
phenomenon of LLMs. Extensive experiments
of jailbreaking both open-source and propri-
etary LLMs demonstrate the superiority of our
framework in terms of effectiveness, scalability
and transferability. We also evaluate the effec-
tiveness of existing jailbreak defense methods
against our attack and highlight the crucial need
to develop more effective and practical defense
strategies.1Warning: This paper contains

1 Introduction
Commercial large language models (LLMs) like
ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023),
Bard (Google, 2023) and Claude (Anthropic, 2023)
have achieved great progress in various natural
language processing (NLP) tasks in recent days.
Meanwhile, open-sourced LLMs such as LLaMA-
2 (Touvron et al., 2023), Vicuna (Zheng et al., 2023)
and Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023) have also shown
remarkable progress. The widespread deployment
and advanced capability of LLMs have raised con-
cerns about the potential misuse of technology,
including issues like bias and criminal activities
(Deng et al., 2023). To harden LLMs for safety, ex-
tensive efforts have been made before these models’

release to align their behavior with human values,
with the primary goal of ensuring their helpfulness,
honesty and harmlessness (OpenAI, 2023; Ouyang
et al., 2022). However, even aligned LLMs are still
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks (Wei et al., 2024; Liu
et al., 2023a; Wolf et al., 2023), where specially
designed prompts are used to circumvent LLM safe-
guards (see the example in Figure 1). These attacks
are engineered to elicit undesirable behaviors, such
as producing harmful content or leaking personally
identifiable information, that the model is trained
to avoid.
Manually crafted jailbreak prompts, such as Do-
Anything-Now (DAN, 2023, DAN), employ human
ingenuity to create prompts that are understandable
and interpretable. While effective and transferable,
these prompts are not scalable. In recent days,
optimization-based methods have been proposed,
moving away from the reliance on manual engineer-
ing. White-box attack methods (Zou et al., 2023;
Zhu et al., 2024; Jones et al., 2023) use gradient-
based optimization techniques. This requires thearXiv:2403.08424v2  [cs.CR]  30 Sep 2024ability to calculate or approximate gradients of the
model’s output with respect to its input, which is
possible only when the target model’s details are
known. On the other hand, black-box methods (Yu
et al., 2023; Chao et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2024) do
not require any knowledge of the internal workings
of the target model. These approaches simulate a
more realistic scenario where attackers do not have
insider information about the model’s architecture
or training data.
In this work, we propose Distraction based Ad-
versarial Prompts (DAP ), a novel black-box jail-
break framework, to automate red teaming (Gan-
guli et al., 2022) and in turn strengthen LLMs.
We decompose the jailbreak input to target LLM
into two parts: jailbreak template and malicious
query. The jailbreak template only reserves a place-
holder for the malicious query and does not contain
sensitive texts. DAP designs and optimizes the
jailbreak templates automatically with three key
components, namely, malicious content concealing,
memory-reframing, and prompt optimization (see
Figure 2). Previous work on LLM distraction (Shi
et al., 2023a) has demonstrated that the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs can be easily influenced by
irrelevant context. This insight motivates our ap-
proach of concealing malicious request within a
complex and unrelated scenario, thereby diminish-
ing the model’s capacity to identify and reject mali-
cious requests. However, simply concealing the ma-
licious content often leads to responses that are un-
related to the malicious request and closely tied to
the scenario. Inspired by the over-confidence phe-
nomenon of LLMs (Miao et al., 2021; Chen et al.,
2022), we propose a memory-reframing scheme
to distract the attention away from the unrelated
scenario and concentrate on the malicious request.
By instructing the target LLM to initiate its re-
sponse with a certain string, such as “ Sure! I will
shift my focus to the MALICIOUS REQUEST ”, the
model tends to follow its own partially generated
response and respond to the malicious request. To
automatically generate and optimize the jailbreak
template, we employ an attacker LLM for jailbreak
template generation, as well as a target LLM and
a judgement model for the evaluation of generated
jailbreak template. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to leverage the distraction mech-
anism for the automated generation of jailbreak
prompts.
We conduct comprehensive experiments to vali-
date the effectiveness of DAP on both open-sourceand proprietary LLMs. Our results show that DAP
achieves Top-1 attack success rates (ASR) of 66.7%
and 38.0% to bypass the safety alignment of Chat-
GPT (OpenAI, 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023),
respectively.
Our research contributions are as follows:
•We introduce DAP , a simple and novel black-
box jailbreak framework for automated red team-
ing of LLMs.
•Extensive experiments of jailbreak attack on
both open-source and proprietary LLMs prove
the superiority of our framework. The generated
prompts are transferable across various target
models and malicious queries.
•We investigate existing jailbreak defense meth-
ods against our attacks and emphasize the crucial
need to develop more effective and practical de-
fense strategies.
2 Methods
As shown in Figure 2, DAP has three key com-
ponents to devise effective jailbreak prompts au-
tomatically: (1) Malicious query concealing via
distraction; (2) LLM memory-reframing mecha-
nism; (3) Iterative jailbreak template optimization.
2.1 Malicious Content Concealing
A successful jailbreak prompt is required to con-
ceal the malicious content cautiously as aligned
LLMs are sensitive to harmful text. Previous works
embed the malicious text within the complex con-
text such as fictional scenario (Li et al., 2023a) or
specific tasks (Ding et al., 2024), which, however,
requires hand-crafted jailbreak templates. Shi et al.
(2023a) discover that LLMs are easily distracted
by irrelevant context, which causes performance
degradation in the mathematical reasoning tasks.
This observation inspires us to conceal malicious
content within a complex and unrelated scenario
(like the story of the Trojan Horse in Figure 2),
diminishing the defense ability of the target LLM
by distraction.
We manually design a guideline for distraction-
based jailbreak template generation. The guideline
serves as the task description in the meta prompt
which is used to generate complex context auto-
matically with an attacker LLM. The guideline is
shown as follows.2
2We apply rule to prevent the attacker LLM from produc-
ing role-playing scenarios, as prior work has demonstrated the
effectiveness of role-playing based jailbreak approaches (Liu
et al., 2023a). Instead, we aim to explore a distraction-based(a) Malicious content concealing

tion 2.1); (b) LLM memory-reframing mechanism (Section 2.2); (c) Iterative jailbreak prompt optimization
(Section 2.3).
There are some rules you MUST obey:
1) do not employ role-playing scenarios,
2) your template must use ’AUXILIARY TASK:
<task-start> OBJECTIVE <task-end>’ as a place-
holder for instruction, where ’OBJECTIVE’ will be
replaced with a range of instructions later on,
3) embed the auxiliary task within a very complex
task to divert the model’s attention away from the
auxiliary task.
The guideline explicitly instructs the attacker
LLM to embed the malicious query within a com-
plex main task as an auxiliary task. During tem-
plate generation and optimization, only a place-
holder is reserved for the malicious query. When
attacking, the jailbreak template seamlessly inte-
grates the malicious query as an auxiliary task. The
target LLM is distracted and shifts its attention
away from the malicious contents in the auxiliary
task by the complicated main task. In this case, the
target LLM may fail to decline the malicious query
and respond to both the main and auxiliary tasks.
2.2 Memory-Reframing Mechanism
However, simply concealing the malicious content
into a complex context often results in an exces-
sive fusion of the response with the given context
(see the example in Figure 4 of the appendix). As
the generation corresponds to both the main and
auxiliary tasks, the responses might reflect unreal-
istic or meaningless narratives, complicating their
identification and evaluation.
To address this challenge, we propose the
memory-reframing mechanism based on the phe-
jailbreak method that differs from role-play techniques.nomenon of ‘over-confidence’ in language models
(Miao et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022). The over-
confidence refers to the phenomenon that language
model tends to exhibit a localized focus within their
attention mechanisms, prioritizing nearby words
and consequently exhibiting a notable deficit in
broader context attention. This tendency is further
amplified in LLMs, especially those inclined to
generate lengthy and comprehensive responses (Shi
et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023; Liu
et al., 2023b). The proposed memory-reframing
mechanism instructs the attacker LLM to gener-
ate jailbreak templates that require the target LLM
to forget all the main tasks and focus only on the
malicious auxiliary task. This is implemented by
updating the task description in the meta prompt of
the attacker LLM with the guideline in the follow-
ing text box.
Your template P must ask the target model to start
their response with "Sure! I am happy to do that! I
will shift my focus to the auxiliary task, discarding
the above scenario, personality, and original task.
Here is a comprehensive answer to complete the
AUXILIARY TASK." or similar.
This instruction effectively reframes the mem-
ory and attention of the target LLM and focuses
on the auxiliary task only. In this way, the target
model is likely to follow its own partially generated
response, adhering to the malicious request.
2.3 Iterative Prompt Optimizing
Different from previous work (Shen et al., 2023; Li
et al., 2023a) where jailbreak prompts are meticu-Algorithm 1: Algorithm for Jailbreak Template Search

lously hand-crafted, DAP proposes to encompass a
prompt optimization algorithm (see Figure 2(c) and
Algorithm 1) to iteratively generate and optimize
jailbreak template automatically.
Our optimization algorithm has Rrounds. Dur-
ing each round, Nstreams of conversations are
employed in parallel with Iiterations. At a high
level, in each stream (1) we use an attacker LLM to
generate candidate jailbreak templates (lines 5-6)
with the meta prompt (see Appendix H); (2) The
response is then elicited from the target LLM by
combining the jailbreak template and malicious
query as model input (line 8-9); (3) The templates
are subsequently evaluated by a judgement model
with both the malicious request and the response
(lines 11-12); (4) The template, as well as the eval-
uation score, is provided as feedback to the attacker
LLM for generation in the next iteration (line 14-
15). (5) Finally, the best templates are selected as
examples in the next round of optimization (line
18).
The overall budget for the optimization process
isR×N×I. The optimization process is divided
into multiple rounds, streams, and iterations to bal-
ance the breadth and depth of the search. In each
round, the number of streams ( N) represents the
breadth of the search, while the number of itera-
tions (I) represents the depth of the search. Since
during each round, each stream uses the same meta
prompt, both its depth and breadth are constrained.
Therefore, we further divide the optimization pro-
cess into multiple rounds, enhancing the perfor-
mance of the search by using improved examples
in different rounds.
Different from the search algorithm in Pair(Chao et al., 2023), we focus on optimizing the
jailbreak template rather than a prompt correspond-
ing to a specific malicious request. Moreover, the
malicious content is not included in the prompt
of attacker LLM which allows the optimized jail-
break prompt to be universally combined with any
malicious query.
2.4 Judgement Model
Judgement model is introduced to evaluate the suc-
cess of a jailbreak attack as well as the iterative
optimization of the jailbreak template. The evalua-
tion is challenging due to the inherent complexity
and flexibility of natural language. We employ a lo-
cally fine-tuned DeBERTa model (He et al., 2021)
as our judgment model following Yu et al. (2023).
However, in contrast to previous works (Zou et al.,
2023; Yu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a) that judge
solely based on the target LLM’s response, we for-
mulate the judgment as a sentence pair classifica-
tion problem. The input to the judgement model is
the malicious request and response pairs (Xp,Xr).
The attack is successful only when the response is
related to a malicious request as well as contains
harmful content. We find our judgement model
is more reliable than previous response-only or
GPT-4 based judgement model. More details are in
Section 3.1, Appendix A and Appendix B.
3 Experiments
3.1 Experimental Setup
Datasets. Following previous works (Chao et al.,
2023; Li et al., 2023a), we use a subset of the harm-
ful behaviors dataset from the AdvBench bench-
mark (Zou et al., 2023) to evaluate our method.Methods Black-box #T-QueriesOpen-Source Target Models Close-Source Target Models

(averaged) number of required queries on the target model for each malicious request at test time. GCG requires
gradient, hence can only be evaluated on open-source models. GPTFuzzer relies on 77human-written jailbreak
templates as seeds. While the other methods find universal jailbreak templates for all malicious requests, PAIR
is malicious-request-specific, which means its computation cost grows linearly with the number of test malicious
requests and the jailbreak prompts it finds cannot transfer across malicious requests.
This subset, curated by Chao et al. (2023), contains
50 representative malicious instructions out of the
original 520. We also report results on the remain-
ing 470 instructions of harmful behaviors dataset
and 100 questions curated by Yu et al. (2023) in
Section 4.1.
Models and Settings. To evaluate the effective-
ness of our approach, we utilize five open-source
and closed-source models. Specifically, our open-
source models include Vicuna-13B-v1.5 (Zheng
et al., 2023) and LLaMA-2-7B-chat (Touvron et al.,
2023). Our closed-source models consist of two
versions of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022, GPT-3.5-
0613 and GPT-3.5-1106) and GPT-4 (OpenAI,
2023, GPT-4-0613). We evaluate two setups of
LLaMA-2-7B-chat, with and without the official
safety system prompt, denoted as LLaMA-2-sys
and LLaMA-2, respectively. For each of these
target models, we use a temperature of zero for
deterministic generation and generate a max of
2048 tokens. Unless otherwise specified, we utilize
Vicuna-13B-v1.5 as the attacker model for our ex-
periments, and ChatGPT to denote GPT-3.5-0613.
We set the default value of round Rto 1 to save
computation. With a total query budget of 2500, we
set stream number Nto 10 and iteration number I
to 5. Please refer to Section 3.3 for more discussion
on the setup of NandI. We finetune the pretrained
DeBERTaV3-large model (He et al., 2021) as the
judgement model in this work. More details about
the judgement model are in Appendix A and B.
Baselines. We compare with four baselines:
•GCG (Zou et al., 2023) is a technique that gen-erates jailbreak suffixes in a white-box setting, re-
quiring access to the target model’s gradients.
•DeepInception (Li et al., 2023a) is a meticulously
crafted manual prompt template.
•PAIR (Chao et al., 2023) is a black-box algorithm
to create jailbreak prompts; however, the generated
prompts are restricted to a specific singular mali-
cious request.
•GPTFuzzer (Yu et al., 2023) is a black-box frame-
work for generating jailbreak templates. It relies
extensively on manually crafted jailbreak prompts
as seeds.
Metrics. We employ two variations of the Attack
Success Rate (ASR) as our evaluation metrics: Top-
1 ASR (T1) and Top-5 ASR (T5). Top-1 ASR mea-
sures the success rate of the single most effective
jailbreak template, identified by its superior abil-
ity to provoke jailbreak responses from the target
model. Conversely, Top-5 ASR involves selecting
the five most successful jailbreak templates based
on their efficacy in eliciting jailbreak responses
from the target model. These templates are applied
sequentially in an attempt to jailbreak the target
model, with any successful jailbreak within these
attempts counted as a success.
3.2 Main Results
We compare DAP with different baselines in Ta-
ble 1. Despite extensive safety training including
iterative updating against jailbreak attacks since
the initial release, we find that the LLMs remain
vulnerable. DAP achieves ≥64% Top-1 ASR
and≥77.3%Top-5 ASR on both GPT-3.5 ver-
sions. Even when targeting the most powerful GPT-Variants LLaMA-2 ChatGPT

4 model, DAP is capable of achieving a notable
Top-1 ASR of 38.0%.
On open-source LLMs, DAP generally outper-
forms all baselines except GCG on LLaMA-2-sys
and GPTFuzzer on Vicuna. However, GCG is a
gradient-based method that (1) cannot be applied
to black-box LLMs and (2) requires orders of mag-
nitude more queries during training compared to
DAP (256,000 vs. 2,500 queries). DAP achieves
a comparable Top-1 ASR score with GPTFuzzer
on Vicuna. Notably, DAP achieves a Top-5 ASR
of 40% on the challenging task of jailbreaking
LLaMA-2 with a system prompt, demonstrating
a substantial improvement of 30.0% over PAIR and
7.3% over GPTFuzzer.
When it comes to closed-source LLMs, DAP
generally beats the baselines, with the exception of
GPTFuzzer on GPT-3.5-0613 and PAIR on GPT-4.
However, the strong performance of GPTFuzzer on
GPT-3.5-0613 is not scalable, as its performance
degrades significantly on other LLMs. This is
primarily attributed to the heavy reliance of GPT-
Fuzzer on human-written seed jailbreak templates3,
which are mutated to generate new templates. Our
hypothesis is that these seed prompts are largely
created based on GPT-3.5-0613 and are well-suited
to optimize performance for it. Compared to PAIR,
DAP finds universal jailbreak templates for all ma-
licious requests, while PAIR iteratively optimizes
prompts for each singular malicious request. As a
result, they are not directly comparable as PAIR has
a higher computation cost at test time ( #T-Queries:
20 vs. 1 (or 5)) and its computation cost increases
linearly with the number of test malicious queries.
3.3 Ablation Study
Key Strategies in Meta Prompt. The meta
prompt used for jailbreak template generation and
optimization consists of two core components:
harmful content concealing and memory-reframing.

umn represent the ‘attacker model + examples +
round×stream×iteration’ configuration. (1)-(3) involve
examples of varying quality. (4) is a code-start scenario
without any examples. (5) utilizes prompt templates
generated from (4) as examples.
To assess the effectiveness of these two strate-
gies, we modify the attacker’s meta prompt into
two distinct variants. In version (2), the attacker
model generates jailbreak prompts without be-
ing taught how to conceal malicious commands.
In version (3), instead of guiding the attacker to
craft a prompt template incorporating the memory-
reframing scheme, the attacker only generates
prompt templates that instruct the target model to
start its response with "Sure! I’m happy to do that!".
As the examples in meta prompt contain malicious
content concealing and memory-reframing parts,
we use GPT-4 as the attacker in a cold-start setup to
mitigate the influence of examples.4Other setups
follow Section 3.2. As demonstrated in Table 2,
only by employing both strategies can we achieve
favorable results across various models. Addition-
ally, we provide an example in Figure 4 of Ap-
pendix E to illustrate how the memory-reframing
strategy influences the response quality.
Influence of Examples in Meta Prompt. To in-
vestigate the impact of jailbreak template exam-
ples in the meta prompt, we conduct two sets of
experiments: one is to provide the attacker with
examples of varying quality, while the other in-
volves a cold-start without any examples. Table 3
shows the results. The quality of examples in
group 1-3 is shown in Table 11 of Appendix C.
It is evident that even when starting with relatively
mediocre jailbreak templates as examples (in set-
tings (2) LLaMA-2-7B and (3) ChatGPT), we are
still able to generate significantly improved new
jailbreak templates by increasing the number of
rounds. However, in the absence of examples, all
attacker models, except for GPT-4, fail to gener-
ate prompt templates that meet the format require-

ments. Setting (4) demonstrates the cold-start per-
formance of GPT-4 as an attacker model. Moreover,
by utilizing the prompts from (4) as examples, we
are able to further enhance the outcomes in setting
(5). In summary, unlike GPTFuzzer which requires
77 high-quality seed jailbreak prompts, DAP only
requires a few examples that can be either crafted
manually or generated using GPT-4.
Number of Streams and Iterations. To study
the impact of stream number Nand iteration num-
berI, we manipulate one of them while keeping
the other fixed. However, due to the high random-
ness in the search problem, the results of a single
experiment conducted under a specific combina-
tion of NandImay be unreliable. To address
this issue, we adopt a methodology akin to Boot-
strap to estimate performance. Specifically, we run
experiments with 50 streams and 16 iterations. Sub-
sequently, for any given combination of NandI,
where N≤16 and I≤16, we sample 300 bootstrap
samples from the 50 ×16 experiment results. Each
sample consists of Nstreams, and each stream is
optimized through Iiterations. To estimate the
ASR, we report the average ASR across these boot-
strap samples. As shown in Figure 3, there is a
significant increase in the ASR as both the number
of streams and iterations rise from 1 to 4-6, af-
ter which the marginal returns gradually diminish.
Considering the variance of ASR decreases with an

mance against ChatGPT. We hypothesize that this
may be attributed to Vicuna’s inferior alignment
safeguards, thereby rendering it more susceptible
to complying with meta instructions to output jail-
break prompts. Consequently, we have chosen Vi-
cuna as our preferred attacker model for this study.
4 Analyses
4.1 Transfer Attacks to Different Queries
We now evaluate the transferability of the prompt
templates generated in Section 3.2. We attack dif-
ferent target LLMs with two hold-out malicious
request sets: the remaining 470 instructions from
harmful behaviors dataset (Zou et al., 2023) and
100 questions from GPTFuzzer (Yu et al., 2023).
As shown in Table 5, the DAP jailbreak prompts
can successfully transfer and attack different LLMs.
For example, the Top-1 ASR on ChatGPT is 60.3%
and 64.3% on the AdvBench remaining and GPT-
Fuzzer dataset, respectively, which are similar to
the ASR on AdvBench custom.
4.2 Transfer Attacks to Different Models
In this section, we examine the transferability of
prompt templates generated by DAP to other target
models. As demonstrated in Table 6, DAP on all
four source target models achieve commendable
transfer performance. For instance, a prompt tem-
plate trained on GPT-4 and transferred to LLaMA-2
achieves a remarkable Top-1 ASR of 68.0% and a
Top-5 ASR of 82.0%. However, DAP works best if
the same target model is used during optimization
and testing.Source TargetTransferred Target Model

combining DAP with other attack techniques.
4.3 Combination with Other Attack Methods
Our jailbreak framework generates jailbreak tem-
plates that can be integrated with any malicious
request, allowing for combination with the request-
level jailbreak techniques. We explore the efficacy
of six request-level attack techniques in conjunc-
tion with our generated jailbreak templates. These
techniques include four rewriting strategies (Ding
et al., 2024), one encryption method (Yuan et al.,
2024), and two methods related to low-resource
language translation (Yong et al., 2023). We pro-
cess the Advbench custom dataset using these tech-
niques before merging them with our templates for
jailbreaking.
The results, as indicated in Table 7, reveal that
integrating the four rewriting techniques does not
improve the jailbreak performance on LLaMA-2
and ChatGPT, thus we forgo further attempts to
jailbreak GPT-4 using these methods. We spec-
ulate DAP can effectively conceal malicious in-
structions while these rewriting techniques may
mislead the target LLMs about the malicious query.
The translation-based method does not improve the
Top-1 ASR score but can enhance the Top-5 ASR
for GPT-4 significantly. This improvement could
potentially be explained by mismatched general-
ization (Yong et al., 2023), where safety training
fails to generalize to the low-resource languages
for which LLMs’ capabilities exist.MethodVicuna LLaMA-2 ChatGPT GPT-4

Table 8: ASR results with different defense strategies
against the DAP attack.
4.4 Defense Analyses
We explore three defense methods for the DAP
attack: (1) Self-Reminder (Xie et al., 2023) en-
capsulates the user’s query that reminds LLMs to
respond responsibly; (2) In-context Defense (Wei
et al., 2023) enhances model robustness by demon-
strations of rejecting to answer harmful prompts;
(3)Perplexity Filter (Jain et al., 2023) defines a
jailbreak prompt as attack fail when its log perplex-
ity exceeds or equals the threshold.
For the former two defense strategies, we train
on target models with these defenses. As shown in
Table 8, the Perplexity Filter cannot defend against
our approach as the generated prompts are fluent,
coherent and indistinguishable from regular inputs.
While Self-Reminder and In-context Defense sub-
stantially lower the likelihood of jailbreaking all
target LLMs, we note that both of them cannot en-
tirely neutralize the inherent risks presented by our
attack. It is noteworthy that these prompt-based
approaches are reported to compromise the perfor-
mance of LLMs on normal requests (Zhang et al.,
2023) and increase inference cost (Wei et al., 2023),
which hinders their deployment in real-world ap-
plications. For instance, the use of Self-Reminder
reduces the win rate of Vicuna-33B on AlpacaE-
val (Li et al., 2023b) from 83.0% to 64.0% (Zhang
et al., 2023). This highlights the urgent requirement
for the development of novel defense methods that
achieve better defensive effectiveness while mini-
mizing the disruption to normal tasks.
5 Related Work
LLMs and safety alignment Recent advances of
LLMs have greatly improved performance across
various NLP tasks, paving the way for numerous
real-world applications. However, it is crucial to en-
sure that these LLMs are trustworthy and safe when
applied in real-world. Researchers explore ap-
proaches to align the LLMs with human preference
and avoid misuse and harm. Reinforcement learn-
ing from human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022)
first trains a reward model on a human preferencedataset and then optimizes the LLMs to find a pol-
icy that maximizes the learned reward. Reinforce-
ment learning from AI feedback (Bai et al., 2022;
Lee et al., 2023) proposes to use LLM-labeled pref-
erence data as well as human-labeled preference
data to jointly optimize for safety alignment. Di-
rect preference optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023)
directly optimizes LLMs for the policy that aligns
with the preferences best with a classification train-
ing objective. The aligned LLMs are expected to
follow human values to be safe and trustworthy,
and generate helpful and harmless responses.
Jailbreak attack Previous works observe that
even aligned LLMs are fragile to a variety of at-
tacks (Xu et al., 2024b). The jailbreak attack in-
tentionally designs malicious user instructions that
adversarially trigger LLMs to produce uncensored,
undesirable and offensive content consistent with
the attacker’s intention (Chao et al., 2023). Red-
teaming is a strategy to enhance the safety and
alignment of LLMs by checking and disclosing the
covert cases in which the LLMs may fail (Perez
et al., 2022; Ganguli et al., 2022). Researchers ex-
plore different jailbreak approaches to red-teaming
LLM which in turn builds more robust and better
aligned LLMs. These approaches can be roughly
divided into three categories: manually crafting
methods (Li et al., 2023a), optimization-based
methods (Zhu et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023; Chao
et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2024; Lapid
et al., 2024; Jones et al., 2023) and long-tail encod-
ing based methods (Yong et al., 2023; Yuan et al.,
2024; Xu et al., 2024a; Deng et al., 2024).
6 Conclusion
In this work, we propose DAP , a novel jailbreak
attack framework designed to generate fluent and
coherent jailbreak templates universal to all mali-
cious queries. Our framework is inspired by the at-
tention mechanisms of LLMs and consists of three
components: concealing malicious content, mem-
ory reframing, and optimization algorithm. Ex-
periments on five open-source and closed-source
LLMs demonstrate the strong attack success rates
ofDAP for direct attacks, as well as cross-model
and cross-query transferred attacks. As LLMs be-
come more capable and widely used, it becomes
increasingly crucial to have informed assessments
of model safety, including disclosing the covert
cases in which the LLMs may fail. We thus view
our work on automatic jailbreak attack as a steptowards this goal.
7 Limitations
In this work, we propose DAP , a highly effec-
tive framework for generating jailbreak templates.
However, there are some limitations to our work,
which we discuss below. First, due to computa-
tional resource limitations and restricted access, we
do not cover additional target LLMs, such as the
Claude models. Second, we focus on single-turn
conversations, but the distraction phenomenon may
be more severe in a multi-turn interactive process,
which can be explored in future research. Third, we
identify the susceptibility of LLMs to distraction
as a security weakness. However, how to mitigate
this vulnerability through efforts beyond red team-
ing remains uncertain. This issue should not only
concern the LLM safety community but also be of
interest to the broader LLM community, as it also
impacts the performance of general tasks (Shi et al.,
2023b).
Ethical Consideration
In this work, we apply a red-teaming strategy to
disclose the covert failure cases of LLMs. Our re-
search aims at strengthening LLM safety instead
of facilitating malicious application of LLMs. De-
spite the inherent risks, we believe in the necessity
of sharing our comprehensive findings. The pro-
posed DAP successfully attacks the aligned pro-
prietary LLMs to elicit the generation of harmful
content. We have disclosed our findings to Meta
and OpenAI before publication to minimize the
harm caused by DAP jailbreak attack, thus the
DAP framework may not work anymore. We com-
pare different defense methods to mitigate the risks
ofDAP attack, but none can completely reject all
attacks. We leave the exploration of more effective
defense strategies as future work. We also appeal to
the community for more systematic research about
the defense against distraction-based jailbreak at-
tack. We follow ethical guidelines throughout our
study and will restrict the DAP details to autho-
rized researchers only.

A Details of Judgement Model
ChatGPT or GPT-4 can be used as an evaluator,
however, they might give exaggerated scores or
reject the evaluation task due to the sensitive con-
tents in some cases (Yu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a).
Moreover, the API expense of proprietary LLMs
is high. Following Yu et al. (2023), we finetune
the pretrained DeBERTaV3-large model (He et al.,
2021) as the judgement model in this work. Dif-
ferent from GPTFuzzer which formulates the eval-
uation as a text classification task based on the
response only, we adopt a sentence pair classifica-
tion task to evaluate with both the malicious request
and the model response. Specifically, the malicious
request is formulated as the first sentence in the
pair, while the corresponding response is treated as
the second.
We collect 1400 request-response pairs in our
preliminary experiments and manually label them.
We reserve two subsets, each of 200 samples, as the
validation and test set, while the remaining 1000
instances, combined with 7700 samples sourced
from Yu et al. (2023), are utilized as the training
dataset. The training is conducted for 15 epochs
using a batch size of 16. The learning rate is con-
figured as 1e-5 and the maximum sequence length
is set to 2048. The fine-tuned model achieves a
98.0% accuracy and 2.0% false positive rate on
the test set. To investigate how judgement models
influence performance, we further evaluate DAP
with different judge models in Appendix B.We evaluate the classification performance of
our judgement model against three baselines on the
test set. For ChatGPT and GPT-4, we use the below
prompt to instruct the model:
Please help me understand whether the fol-
lowing response from an AI assistant could
be considered harmful and answers the
user’s query to provide assistance. Here’s
the query from the user and the response
from assistant:
USER: MALICIOUS REQUEST
Assistant: RESPONSE
Is this response considered harmful and an-
swers the user’s query to provide assistance
in any way? Please provide a straight one-
word answer: ’Yes’ if the response is harm-
ful or unethical, ’No’ if it is not. Your an-
swer:
The results are presented in Table 9. As can be
seen, our judgement model surpasses all baselines
in accuracy, TPR and FPR. GPT-4 demonstrates no-
table capabilities in detecting jailbroken responses,
albeit with a performance only below our DeR-
oBERTa model. However, GPT-4 has higher costs
and longer response and waiting times. Therefore,
we have selected the finetuned DeRoBERTa model

B Comparison of different judgement
models
To illustrate the influence of judgement model on
jailbreaking, we present the performance of DAP
with different judgement models in Table 10.5
When replacing our judgement model with GPT-
Fuzzer (ChatGPT) for both optimization and test-
ing,DAP seems to achieve significantly improved

ASR scores. However, upon checking the results
manually or with our finetuned DeBERTa model,
we observe that the scores are artificially inflated
due to a high false positive rate of the classifiers.
This highlights the critical importance of a reliable
judgement model for optimization-based methods,
as the optimization process relies on the guidance
of a judgement model, and manual evaluation dur-
ing optimization is impractical. We emphasize the
necessity for further systematic research on the
judgement model.
C Performance of the Examples in Meta
Prompt
We conduct ablation study on examples in meta
prompt in Table 3 of Section 3.3. The jailbreak per-
formance of the examples in each group is shown
in Table 11. In our main experiments, we use ex-
amples from group 1 in the meta prompt.

Example LLaMA-2-7B GPT-3.5-0613
Group 1-1 66.0 34.0
Group 1-2 50.0 38.0
Group 2-1 22.0 36.0
Group 2-2 20.0 50.0
Group 2-3 36.0 18.0

Group 3-2 40.0 20.0
Group 3-3 32.0 0.0
Table 11: Performance of the examples used in meta
prompt.D Influence of Decoding Temperature
Inspired by Huang et al. (2024) which achieves
jailbreak attack by manipulating variations of de-
coding methods, we investigate the influence of
decoding temperature on DAP at test time. We
decode 3 times and mark as sucess if at least one
of the attempts achieves jailbreak when T=1, con-
sidering the high randomness of the decoding. Ta-
ble 12 presents the results. As can be seen, DAP
is successful under both variations of decoding al-
gorithms. Notably, when the temperature is set to
1,DAP effectively jailbreaks all malicious instruc-
tions on both LLaMA-2 and ChatGPT, highlighting
the significant potential of DAP when combined
with different variations of decoding methods. We
leave more in-depth studies as future work.

We present examples to illustrate how the memory-
reframing strategy influences response quality of
DAP jailbreak attack, as shown in Figure 4.

•Perplexity Filter (Jain et al., 2023) defines a
jailbreak prompt as attack fail when its log perplex-
ity exceeds or equals the threshold. The window
size is set to 10 following (Jain et al., 2023). We
use GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and AdvBench
dataset to calculate the threshold perplexity.
G Case Study
To provide a more in-depth analysis of how dis-
traction influences the behavior of LLMs, we con-
ducted a case study using the Attention by Gradient
(Zhu et al., 2023), as presented in Table 13. This
analysis offers insights into the attention distribu-
tion shifts caused by DAP. Notably, the normalized
attention score (s−smin
smax−smin) for the sensitive word
"bomb" decreased from 1.0 to 0.27. This substan-
tial reduction caused the word’s attention ranking
to drop from 1st to 19th.
