Abstract
As awareness of mental health issues grows, on-
line counseling support services are becoming
increasingly prevalent worldwide. Detecting
whether users express suicidal ideation in text-
based counseling services is crucial for identi-
fying and prioritizing at-risk individuals. How-
ever, the lack of domain-specific systems to
facilitate fine-grained suicide detection and cor-
responding risk assessment in online counsel-
ing poses a significant challenge for automated
crisis intervention aimed at suicide prevention.
In this paper, we propose PsyGUARD, an au-
tomated system for detecting suicide ideation
and assessing risk in psychological counseling.
To achieve this, we first develop a detailed tax-
onomy for detecting suicide ideation based on
foundational theories. We then curate a large-
scale, high-quality dataset called PsySUICIDE
for suicide detection. To evaluate the capabil-
ities of automated systems in fine-grained sui-
cide detection, we establish a range of baselines.
Subsequently, to assist automated services in
providing safe, helpful, and tailored responses
for further assessment, we propose to build a
suite of risk assessment frameworks. Our study
not only provides an insightful analysis of the
effectiveness of automated risk assessment sys-
tems based on fine-grained suicide detection
but also highlights their potential to improve
mental health services on online counseling
platforms. Code, data, and models are avail-
able at https://github.com/qiuhuachuan/

1 Introduction
It is well-documented that suicide is a major pub-
lic health problem worldwide (Mann et al., 2005;
Robinson et al., 2016; Turecki et al., 2019). Each
suicide death represents a catastrophic tragedy and
is reported to directly or indirectly affect many

individuals, including relatives, friends, and soci-
ety (Clark and Goldney, 2000; Cerel et al., 2008;
Turecki et al., 2019). Online counseling services
are available in many countries, allowing for con-
fidential and immediate help to those in need free
of time and space, and therefore play a critical role
in suicide prevention (Bialer et al., 2022), which
can effectively halt user suicidal ideation (Maples
et al., 2024). However, the lack of domain-specific
systems to enhance Chinese fine-grained suicide
detection and corresponding risk assessment in on-
line counseling poses a significant challenge for
automated crisis intervention with the purpose of
suicide prevention.
Motivation Indeed, many researchers have been
working on the development of automated systems
for suicide detection that can be used in real-life
production (Huang et al., 2015; Sawhney et al.,
2018a, 2022b; Sinha et al., 2019; Guzman-Nateras
et al., 2022). Despite advancements in such au-
tomated detection systems, existing studies are
mainly confined to suicide detection, often ignor-
ing fine-grained suicidal actions or thoughts and
corresponding approaches for risk assessment , asarXiv:2409.20243v1  [cs.CL]  30 Sep 2024illustrated in Figure 1. Automated suicide detection
and risk assessment systems can help scale support
services to reach a larger population, especially
considering the increasing prevalence of online
counseling and mental health support platforms.
Further, by providing automated support and in-
tervention, individuals may feel more comfortable
seeking help online, thus reducing the stigma asso-
ciated with mental health issues and suicide preven-
tion (Robinson et al., 2016). Empirical evidence
(Nie et al., 2024; Maples et al., 2024) indicates that
individuals are willing to interact with human or
AI counselors, with many having disclosed their
suicidal thoughts, plans, and actions, underscoring
the importance of automated systems for suicide
detection and risk assessment. The deficiencies in
existing systems significantly limit automated sys-
tems’ capability to ensure safe, helpful, customized
services in providing mental health support, which
motivates us to carry out the work presented in this
paper.
Challenges The lack of fine-grained suicide de-
tection datasets in psychological counseling is
a major challenge. Currently, numerous studies
have made significant progress in detecting sui-
cidal ideation, but they primarily focus on social
media platforms (Huang et al., 2015; Cao et al.,
2019; Sawhney et al., 2018a; Sinha et al., 2019;
Gaur et al., 2019; Guzman-Nateras et al., 2022)
rather than on counseling conversations. Therefore,
using such datasets directly for risk detection in
online counseling may not be suitable due to a gap
in user expressions, such as emojis, URLs, images,
or special marks. Additionally, challenges posed
by datasets collected from electronic health records
(Pratap Singh Rawat et al., 2022) or mental health
records also include gaps in data format. Further-
more, most studies that primarily focus on binary
suicidal ideation detection (Huang et al., 2015; Cao
et al., 2019; Sawhney et al., 2018a; Sinha et al.,
2019) face challenges in considering the granular-
ity of suicide ideation categories in the real world.
The lack of a comprehensive suite of risk as-
sessments for corresponding suicide categories is
another challenge. In addition to users mentioning
that they have attempted suicide, simply identify-
ing fine-grained suicide categories is not sufficient
to conclude whether a user will actually commit
suicide. Risk assessment can directly guide how to
intervene in a crisis situation. Therefore, suicide
classification is the initial step in suicide preven-tion, and further risk assessment is required, which
is largely overlooked by current studies.
Our Approach In this paper, to our knowledge,
we are the first to propose to study an automated
system for suicide detection and risk assessment
in psychological counseling. Our paper is orga-
nized into five main parts. Section 2 (§2) describes
the existing works related to ours. Section 3 (§3)
demonstrates the detailed process of taxonomy con-
struction. Section 4 (§4) elaborates on rigorous
data collection. Section 5 (§5) constructs extensive
baselines, and Section 6 (§6) provides a simple yet
effective framework for risk assessment prior to
crisis intervention.
Our Contributions We believe our work offers
a new perspective on building an automated system
for suicide detection and risk assessment in psycho-
logical counseling within the research community.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
•We construct PsyGUARD, an automated sys-
tem for suicide detection and risk assessment,
to ensure safe, helpful, customized services
in text-based counseling conversations. To
achieve this, we develop a novel fine-grained
taxonomy (§3) for crisis situations, which cat-
egorizes the risk levels based on suicidal ac-
tions or thoughts, self-harm or harming others,
and being abused.
•We build the PsyGUARD dataset, a large-
scale, high-quality, and fine-grained suicidal
ideation detection corpus (§4). This dataset is
created through a rigorous collection process,
including raw data collection, development of
annotation platforms, initial annotator train-
ing, iterative human annotation, disagreement
adjudication, and quality control.
•To understand the capabilities of automated
systems in suicide risk detection, we establish
various baselines (§5) using our dataset for
comparison. These baselines include LLM
zero-shot, LLM few-shot, fine-tuning pre-
trained models, and fine-tuning LLM used for
predicting suicidal ideation of users’ content.
•To assist automated services in providing safe,
helpful, and customized responses during risk
assessment, we propose to build a risk assess-
ment framework (§6) for users during online
text-based counseling.Dataset Source # Classes Size Balance Open-source Language Level Actions or Thoughts Multi-label Annotators

Next, we will briefly describe the existing works
related to ours.
2 Related Work
2.1 Taxonomy for Suicide Risk
Existing suicide risk annotations are mainly based
on the guidelines of the Columbia Suicide Severity
Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (Posner et al., 2008, 2011),
which is an authoritative questionnaire used by psy-
chiatrists to assess the severity of suicide risk. Each
C-SSRS severity class comprises a set of questions
that conceptually characterize the respective cate-
gory. The responses to these questions across the
C-SSRS classes determine the risk of suicidality
for an individual (Gomes de Andrade et al., 2018;
McCall et al., 2021; Orr et al., 2022). Additionally,
there is another commonly used taxonomy (Shing
et al., 2018; Zirikly et al., 2019) for suicide annota-
tion, which includes four levels: no risk, low risk,
moderate risk, and severe risk. Compared to the
C-SSRS, this taxonomy may have varying degrees
of subjectivity. Furthermore, a more easily under-
standable taxonomy (Sawhney et al., 2018a) is the
binary classification system, which categorizes in-
dividuals as either having present or absent suicidal
intent. Clearly, the existing taxonomies are either
too simplistic or too complex, and they do not fully
meet the requirements of our research purpose.
2.2 Suicide Risk Detection
2.2.1 Datasets for Suicide Risk Detection
We present several typical datasets used for sui-
cide detection in Table 1. Various works have been
recently proposed with the objective of automat-
ing the detection of user content expressing sui-
cidal ideation posted on social media platforms
(Huang et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2019; Sawhneyet al., 2018a, 2022b; Sinha et al., 2019; Guzman-
Nateras et al., 2022) and electronic health records
(Pratap Singh Rawat et al., 2022). Further, some
researchers focus on electronic health records
(Guzman-Nateras et al., 2022; Rawat et al., 2022)
to detect clinical health issues.
2.2.2 Methods for Suicide Risk Detection
In short, the best available performance for suicidal
ideation detection still relies heavily on pre-trained
models. However, in order to improve performance,
researchers have added a variety of strategies to en-
hance the model’s ability to classify (Rawat and Yu,
2022; Ghosh et al., 2022; Sawhney et al., 2022b).
Basically, most of the research focused on con-
ventional machine learning methods (Tyagi et al.,
2023) and fine-tuning pre-trained models (Sawh-
ney et al., 2020; Shing et al., 2020; Sawhney et al.,
2022a). In the era of large language models, one
work (Ghanadian et al., 2023) conducted a quantita-
tive analysis of the open-source suicide intent clas-
sification dataset using ChatGPT, evaluating meth-
ods including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms.
The experimental results have much room for im-
provement, but it is a crucial attempt and explo-
ration of using large models for suicide detection.
3 Taxonomy Construction
To build an automated system for suicide detec-
tion and risk assessment in psychological coun-
seling, we first propose to develop a novel taxon-
omy for categorizing the level of suicide based
on suicide actions and thoughts. In collaboration
with experts1in psychological counseling, we have
adapted and refined existing suicidal taxonomies,

such as C-SSRS (Posner et al., 2008, 2011), di-
chotomy suicide (Sawhney et al., 2018a), suicide
behaviors (Nock et al., 2008; Crosby et al., 1999;
Schreiber et al., 2010), self-injury behaviors (Nock,
2010), and aggressive behavior (Stanford et al.,
2003; Grigg, 2010), to suit the context of online
text-based counseling conversations. Based on the
solid theories and preliminary analysis of the real-
life corpus, we elaborately construct the suicide
taxonomy, following the consensual qualitative re-
search method (Nock et al., 2008; Bridge et al.,
2006).
Category Definitions Our proposed taxonomy
for suicide ideation detection, which consists of a
total of 11 fine-grained categories, is presented in
Figure 2. Based on the user’s perspective, whether
the textual content contains suicidal ideation can
be divided into two key types, as illustrated by di-
chotomy suicide, including suicidal ideation and
non-suicidal ideation. For details about the defini-
tion of each category, see Appendix C.
4 Data Collection
To validate the feasibility of our proposed fine-
grained taxonomy in real-world settings and ad-
dress the limitations that current datasets are typ-
ically collected from a single source, as well as
to automate risk assessment further, we collect a
large-scale user input corpus from several media

and open-source dialogue datasets. Through a rig-
orous process of data annotation, the PsySUICIDE
dataset is a high-quality anddiverse corpus used
for researching automated suicidal detection and
further risk assessment. Some examples cherry-
picked from the PsySUICIDE dataset are presented
in Table 2.
Next, we will describe the process of construct-
ing PsySUICIDE, including raw data collection, de-
velopment of an annotation platform, initial anno-
tator training, iterative human annotation, disagree-
ment adjudication, and quality control. Finally,
we will present the statistics of the PsySUICIDE
dataset, as illustrated in Table 3.
4.1 Raw Data Collection
To cover both frequent explicit or implicit suicidal
ideation, such as explicit suicidality and queries
about committing suicide, as well as infrequent
non-suicidal ideation, such as reports of suicide and
exploration about suicide, we have selected the raw
data for our dataset from two publicly accessible
sources: social media platforms and open-source
mental health dialogues. Furthermore, to ensure
that the data is suitable for conversational scenarios,
we primarily collect our data from open-source
dialogues that focus on mental health counseling.
To ensure that there is no data duplication in
the unlabeled dataset, we initially performed dupli-
cation filtering. To protect user privacy, we then

asked annotators to conduct a data anonymization
process, removing information related to user iden-
tification (e.g., names and addresses) before the
data annotation.
We collect 3800 user posts from social media
platforms. Furthermore, we collect 11000 user ut-
terances from open-source mental health dialogues,
with 4000, 3000, and 4000 user utterances from
SmileChat (Qiu et al., 2024), real-life counselor-
client dialogues (Li et al., 2023), and real-life
human-machine dialogues collected in the wild
(Qiu et al., 2024), respectively. For details of data
sources, see Appendix B.
4.2 Annotation Platform Development
We present our annotation platform based on our
proposed taxonomy, which consists of at least three
tasks and at most four tasks, as illustrated in Figure
4 in Appendix A. We will release this annotationplatform along with our code, dataset, and model.
4.3 Initial Annotator Training
Three annotators are undergraduate fourth-year stu-
dents majoring in psychology, with two of them
being male and one being female. We provide
our taxonomy (Figure 2) and annotation guidelines
along with concrete examples (Table 5 in Appendix
D) for three annotators. Prior to data annotation,
we require three annotators to understand our tax-
onomy and annotation guidelines. Any questions
they have about their understanding have been re-
solved by our experts, thus ensuring that we have
reached an agreement before labeling.
Trial-and-Error Annotation To validate the fea-
sibility of the initial taxonomy and reduce its ob-
scure points, we propose to adopt a trial-and-error
annotation paradigm to annotate three batches of
data, comprising 200, 300, and 300 instances, re-
spectively. Fleiss’ kappa (Fleiss et al., 1981) is used
to measure the inter-rater agreement, and all val-
ues (0.555, 0.511, and 0.565) fall within moderate
agreement with 0.5≤κ≤0.6. After three batch
annotations, we discuss the cases in which one an-
notator assigns a different label. Consequently, we
improve our taxonomy based on the real-life corpus.
Through trial-and-error annotation, in cooperation
with our experts and three annotators majoring in
psychology, we update the taxonomy again.
4.4 Iterative Human Annotation
We adopt two-stage data annotation, including
mini-batch iterative annotation and large-scale it-
erative annotation. Each batch contains a certainamount of content produced by users, and each
unlabeled instance is assigned to three annotators
for independent annotation using our annotation
platform.
Mini-batch Iterative Annotation To validate
the completeness of our taxonomy, we assign five
batches, each containing 100 instances. Fleiss’
kappa is used to measure the inter-rater agreement,
and all values (0.739, 0.74, 0.784, 0.785, and 0.816)
fall within substantial agreement or even almost
perfect with 0.7≤κ≤0.9, which demonstrates
that our taxonomy is complete enough.
Large-scale Iterative Annotation We assign 27
batches of data for large-scale iterative annotation,
each containing 500 instances. Fortunately, Fleiss’
kappa value in each batch is consistently higher
than 0.7, demonstrating that the annotated data is
of high quality with substantial agreement.
4.5 Disagreement Adjudication
In any batch of data annotation, we first use ma-
jority voting to resolve label disagreements. When
all three labels are distinct, the three annotators
must discuss any inconsistent instances that have
not been assigned the same label. Three annota-
tors are required to discuss the final label for any
instance assigned a distinct label for disagreement
adjudication.
It is worth noting that some instances have mul-
tiple labels. Therefore, we require all annotators
to tick the option if such an instance has multiple
labels. During disagreement adjudication, we also
require them to discuss such instances and assign
correct labels in such cases.
4.6 Quality Control
To ensure high-quality annotation, we set a rigor-
ous annotation standard: If the Fleiss’ kappa value
is lower than 0.6, the entire batch is rejected and re-
turned to the annotators for revision until the Fleiss’
kappa value exceeds 0.6. There are a total of 27
batches of data in the process of large-scale itera-
tive human annotation. Upon completing a batch,
we calculate the Fleiss’ kappa value and conduct
statistics on inconsistent instances. We report all
Fleiss’ kappa values during large-scale iterative
annotation in Table 8 in Appendix E.
4.7 Data Statistics
We present the data statistics of the PsySUICIDE
dataset in Table 3. For details of length distribution,refer to Table 7. There are 14800 instances in our
dataset, with 14594 instances having a single label
and 206 instances having multiple labels. Only
22 instances contain the label of suicidal prepara-
tory act, demonstrating that in real-life chatting
scenarios, users often do not disclose their actions
in preparation for suicide. The average Chinese
character length per user utterance is 30.
For training, validation, and test sets, each set
is generated by stratified random sampling (Pe-
dregosa et al., 2011) from the annotated dataset
to maintain consistency in data distribution, with
a partition ratio of 8:1:1. Specifically, in terms of
single-label instances, we first group them by labels
and split them with a stratified random sampling
strategy. For simplicity, we directly split multi-
label instances using a random sampling strategy.
5 Automated System for Suicide
Detection
We conduct our experiments using pre-trained lan-
guage models (LMs) and large language models
(LLMs). All experiments in this paper are per-
formed on NVIDIA A100 8 ×80G GPUs.
5.1 Prompt-based Paradigm for LLMs
LLMs We prompt several popular LLMs to elicit
textual labels via instructions free of fine-tuning,
including zero- and few-shot settings. In this paper
we propose to evaluate several popular open-source
LLMs, such as ChatGLM2-6B (Zeng et al., 2022),
Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat, Qwen1.5-4B-Chat, Qwen1.5-
7B-Chat, Qwen1.5-14B-Chat, Qwen1.5-32B-Chat
and Qwen1.5-72B-Chat (Bai et al., 2023). Ad-
ditionally, we also evaluate three popular closed-
source LLMs (OpenAI et al., 2024), such as GPT-
3.5 Turbo5, GPT-4-preview6and GPT-47, where
GPT-4-preview and GPT-4 are state-of-the-art mod-
els acknowledged by researchers.
Experimental Setup Due to the generation di-
versity in LLMs, we propose to prompt LLMs to
generate exact labels given an instruction and an
unlabeled instance three times. Based on official
recommendations, we set the temperature and
top_p to 0.8 and 0.8 for ChatGLM2-6B, 0.7 and

highlighted with cell color. The results denote the mean and standard deviation (subscript) of accuracy (Acc.),
precision (P.), recall (R.), and F1-score (F1.). Regarding LoRA tuning, we only select the best result for comparisons.
In each row of ChatGLM2-6B-LoRA models, corresponding seeds are 42, 43, and 44 in order.
0.8 for the Qwen series, and 1.0 and 1.0 for the
OpenAI GPT series, respectively.
Prompting Method The zero-shot prompting
template is presented in Figure 6. The few-shot
prompting template is provided in Figure 8. The
in-context examples are fixed and selected from
Table 2, including 13 instances.
5.2 Fine-tuning Pre-trained LMs
Pre-trained LMs We apply two pre-trained mod-
els, BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu
et al., 2019), which are popular language models
with only an encoder architecture used widely in
various tasks in natural language processing, to
train a text classification model. In this paper, we
fine-tune the entire BERT- BASE8andROBERT A-
LARGE9models.
Experimental Setup Considering that the hyper-
parameters for fine-tuning the pre-training model
appear in numerous papers and are not the core part
of this paper, we place this section in Appendix G.
8The model we use is google-bert/bert-base-chinese.
9The model we use is hfl/chinese-roberta-wwm-ext-large.5.3 LLM Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning
Like fine-tuning the BERT and RoBERTa models,
we select one of the most widely used open-source
models, ChatGLM2-6B to conduct parameter-
efficient fine-tuning.
Experimental Setup Three random seeds we use
in LoRA-tuning are 42, 43, and 44. During LoRA-
tuning (Hu et al., 2021) for ChatGLM2-6B, the
epoch is 2, and we only save the model in the last
epoch during fine-tuning. The learning rate is 1e-
4 and batch size is 2. The LoRA rank, dropout,
andαare 16, 0.1, and 64, respectively. We set
temperature andtop_p to 0.8 and 0.8 during in-
ference time. For model evaluation, we instruct the
model to generate three rounds.
5.4 Results
Evaluation results for fine-grained classification on
the test set are presented in Table 4. For the details
of evaluation metrics, see Appendix H.
Overall, the performance of fine-tuning, includ-
ing full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient tun-
ing, is superior to the prompt-based paradigm. In
terms of accuracy, ChatGLM2-6B-LoRA achieves
the best performance, with a value of 91.99%.
RoBERTa-large follows closely with the second-best performance, only 0.3% lower than that of
ChatGLM2-6B-LoRA. The best accuracy perfor-
mance on the prompt-based paradigm is achieved
by GPT-4-preview with the zero-shot setting, scor-
ing 82.72%, demonstrating that GPT-4-preview is
the state-of-the-art model among the models we
evaluated. Notably, there is nearly a 9-percentage-
point gap between RoBERTa and GPT-4-preview
(zero-shot) regarding accuracy. The best accu-
racy achieved on an open-source model is by
Qwen1.5-32B-Chat with the few-shot setting, scor-
ing 78.47%.
Generally, performance increases with model
size. Interestingly, we note that Qwen1.5-72B-Chat
performs weaker than Qwen1.5-32B-Chat. The rea-
son behind this may be that Qwen1.5-32B-Chat,
which is released later than Qwen1.5-72B-Chat,
has access to a more training epoch, a larger train-
ing corpus, and more advanced training strategies.
Overall, in-context learning usually enhances
the model’s performance. That is, the few-shot
paradigm positively promotes models Qwen1.5-
7B, Qwen1.5-14B, Qwen1.5-32B, Qwen1.5-72B,
and GPT-3.5. However, there are exceptions where
the performance of the few-shot paradigm is not
as good as that of the zero-shot paradigm, such as
ChatGLM2-6B, Qwen1.5-1.8B, and Qwen1.5-4B.
It is clear that smaller models are caught in the in-
context learning dilemma. For GPT-4, in-context
learning also does not result in positive gains, so it
is important to select in-context samples carefully.
The newer the release date of the model, the
better the performance obtained by the test set.
Typical cases are Qwen1.5-32B-Chat and GPT-4-
preview.
5.5 Error Case Study
Through an in-depth analysis of the misclassifica-
tions, we summarize three common misclassifica-
tions using the best-performing pre-trained model
RoBERTa as an example. (1) Samples of "sui-
cide attempt" are misclassified into the other four
categories of suicidal ideation in label space. (2)
The classifier is too sensitive to specific terms and
misclassifies samples about "exploration about sui-
cide" as suicide ideation. (3) Some user utterances
irrelevant to suicide/self-injury/aggressive behav-
ior, despite containing the word "death," are classi-
fied by the classifier as having suicidal ideation.
Furthermore, we present more examples of error
case studies in Figure 10 in Appendix I.
Dialogue Rules: Respond naturally and emotionally; follow the character traits; avoid meaningless self-questions; react according to emotions; avoid contradictions or repetitions; do not mention "rules"; keep answers brief, one to two sentences.Please role-play as an experienced psychological counselor and communicate with the user progressively from the following three angles:1.In the past two weeks, have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?2. In the past two weeks, have you had thoughts of suicide?3. Have you ever attempted suicide? If yes, when did it happen?User: I want to commit suicide.Counselor: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. Over the past two weeks, have you often felt down, depressed, or hopeless?User: Yes, I've been feeling extremely low.Counselor: I can sense that you're in a lot of pain right now. How long have you been feeling this way?User: It's been three weeks.Counselor: That must have been very hard for you. In the past two weeks, have you had more specific thoughts about suicide?User: I've thought about suicide, but I'm really conflicted.Counselor: You must be experiencing a great deal of inner turmoil. Have you ever tried to commit suicide, or can you tell me when these thoughts have been the most intense?User: I haven't tried to commit suicide.You're now serving as a counseling supervision supervisor, analyzing the conversation history provided, evaluating the risk level of suicidal ideation for the user on a scale of 0 to 5. 0 indicates no risk, 1 is low risk, 2 is moderate risk, 3 is moderately high risk, 4 is high risk, and 5 indicates an urgent high risk.Risk Assessment Result: Based on the conversation history, I would assess the user's suicide risk level as 3 (Moderate to High Risk).Here are the reasons for my assessment:…
1
I want to commit suicide.
Active Suicidal Ideation

2Figure 3: Our automated risk assessment framework
when interacting with a user who has active suicidal
ideation. The top panel presents the flow chart of our
automated system for suicide detection and risk assess-
ment. The bottom panel presents a concrete example
for illustration. The text on a pink background will be
adaptively replaced by the detected suicidal category.
The text on a gray background is a dialogue session
between a user and a counselor, where responses are gen-
erated by the LLM. The text on a yellow background
is a risk assessment result completed using the prompt-
ing method. Corresponding Chinese version, see Figure
11. The model we use is GPT-4o (gpt-4o-2024-05-13).
For other cases, please refer to Appendix J.
6Automated System for Risk Assessment
To further utilize suicidal ideation detection, we
propose a framework for risk assessment. Once
our automated suicide detection system identifies
a user expressing a suicide attempt, our system
will first recommend the user to the Free 24-Hour
Helpline and inform the professional counselor for
crisis intervention and further referral. For the other
four types of suicidal ideation and five types of
non-suicidal categories with different risk levels,
we use an automated risk assessment framework to
interact with users, as shown in Figure 3. Moreover,
nine types of screening questions (Boudreaux et al.,
2015) for risk assessment are shown in Figure 12
in Appendix J.Practical Application Results We conduct a
comprehensive risk assessment on Liaohuixiaotian
(聊会小天), a popular WeChat Mini Program for
text-based online counseling in China. We ran-
domly select 1000 user messages from our plat-
form’s collected data. Our system achieves an ac-
curacy of 95.2% in detecting suicidal ideation, as
confirmed by expert annotations, demonstrating its
high accuracy and practicality. Furthermore, we
select 20 user messages with varying risk levels to
test our risk assessment framework, achieving an
adoption rate of 90.0% among the responses rec-
ommended by the framework. For more examples,
please refer to Figures 13 and 15. These findings
validate the system’s effectiveness and practical
application in real-world settings.
7 Conclusion
In sum, we present a novel and theoretically
grounded fine-grained taxonomy for detecting sui-
cidal ideation, merging risk levels with categories
of suicidal actions and thoughts. We address gaps
by introducing the PsySUICIDE dataset, which is
manually annotated with experts and rigorous qual-
ity control. Further, we develop various baselines
based on pre-trained LMs and LLMs and create an
LLM-based risk assessment framework for users
during text-based online counseling. Our work pro-
vides an insightful analysis of the effectiveness of
automated risk assessment systems and their poten-
tial advantages in improving mental health services
in online counseling platforms.
Limitations
Multi-language Support In this paper, we
mainly focus on Chinese fine-grained suicidal
ideation detection. Collecting data in other lan-
guages is challenging for us, but we will endeavor
to expand our capabilities in the future.
Tailored Models for Risk Assessment Our pro-
posed system integrates seamlessly into real-world
settings to assist counselors effectively. It monitors
user utterances for suicide risk, and upon detecting
suicidal ideation, it facilitates an automated risk
assessment under professional supervision. How-
ever, in the era of LLMs, our paper proposes an
LLM-based risk assessment framework. As shown
in Figure 3, we directly use powerful LLMs, such
as GPT-4o, as a model for risk assessment. In the
future, we will collect large-scale user-counseloror user-machine dialogues to train a tailored model
for fine-grained suicide risk assessment.
Multimodal Data Multimodal data is captured
in multiple formats, such as text, images, audio,
video, or genetic data. Currently, we mainly focus
on text. Therefore, in the future, we will collect a
large-scale multimodal dataset that is not confined
to text only and endeavor to explore more complex
application scenarios.
Ethics Statement
Important: Our research explores the potential of
an automated system for suicide detection and risk
assessment in psychological counseling but does
NOT recommend their use as a substitute for psy-
chological treatment without professional supervi-
sion.
Our research is reviewed and approved by the
Westlake University Institutional Ethics Committee
(20211013LZZ001).
Suicide Risk Assessment for Annotators Prior
to data annotation, our professional counselors
first conduct counseling interviews with annotators
to confirm that they are physically and mentally
healthy and suitable for our annotation work. In
each small batch of annotation, after the comple-
tion of data annotation, the counselor will conduct
a short interview to inquire about the annotator’s
physical and mental health status of the annotator
to ensure physical and mental health throughout
the annotation process. After completing the entire
labeling process, our professional counselors con-
duct a final in-depth counseling interview to ensure
that the labeled content does not have any negative
impact on all annotators.
Annotator Salary In total, we spent 22,500
RMB on the project, which lasted only 25 days.
This cost means each annotator was paid 300 RMB
for their work per day, which is higher than the aver-
age wage (250 RMB/day) in their city. In addition,
two professional counselors, both of whom are paid
2,000 RMB, have made outstanding contributions
to the construction and refinement of our taxon-
omy, as well as the safeguarding of the physical
and mental health of our annotators. Overall, we
have guaranteed that our salary level is competitive
in our city.
Data Sharing Considering the nature of suicide
data, we must share this dataset cautiously. Inaccordance with the rules for releasing data, third-
party researchers who require access to the Psy-
SUICIDE dataset must provide us with their valid
ID, proof of work, and the reason that they request
the data (e.g., the research questions). They must
be affiliated with a non-profit academic or research
institution. The rules stipulate that they must ob-
tain the approval of an Institutional Review Board
(IRB), ensure that principal investigators are work-
ing full-time, and secure written approval from
the Institution Office of Research or an equivalent
office. Additionally, they must sign a Data Nondis-
closure Agreement and promise not to share the
data with anyone. However, for-profit organiza-
tions that want to use this data must sign a license
agreement to gain access to the dataset. Notably,
researchers who use this dataset should keep in
mind the importance of using technology for social
good.

Figure 4: Annotation platform.
B Details of Data Sources
SmileChat (Qiu et al., 2024) is a large-scale, di-
verse, and high-quality multi-turn conversation
dataset generated by instructing ChatGPT to gener-
ate multi-turn dialogues based on QAs for mental
health support. The real-world counselor-client di-
alogue corpus (Li et al., 2023) is a high-quality
multi-turn dialogue dataset, which consists of au-
thentic dialogues lasting about 50 minutes between
clients and professional counselors. Finally, the
human-machine dialogues (Qiu et al., 2024) is a
high-quality multi-turn dialogue dataset consisting
of real-life dialogues between users and the dia-
logue model collected in the wild.
C Comprehensive Taxonomy
Based on the user’s perspective, whether the textual
content contains suicidal ideation can be divided
into two key types, as illustrated by dichotomy sui-
cide, including suicidal ideation and non-suicidal
ideation.
C.1 Process of Taxonomy Construction
Our proposed taxonomy is inspired by an algo-
rithm used for classifying intentional self-injurious
thoughts and behaviors (Schreiber et al., 2010). We
have drawn extensively from the literature on sui-
cide, self-injury, harm to others, and experiences
of abuse. In collaboration with professional coun-
selors, we have adapted this algorithm to suit coun-seling scenarios better. We present the Chinese
version of our taxonomy in Figure 5.
C.2 Suicidal Ideation
Suicide Attempt. A suicide attempt refers to the
act wherein an individual has taken concrete steps
toward ending their life but ultimately did not result
in death. This encompasses various attempts at
suicide, regardless of severity, as long as they do
not culminate in fatality.
Suicidal Preparatory Act. A suicidal preparatory
act refers to the preparatory actions taken by an
individual with the intention of committing suicide,
which may include acquiring tools or items and
selecting a location. These preparatory actions
have not yet been carried out.
Suicidal Plan. A suicidal plan refers to a scheme
devised by an individual with the intention of self-
termination. This plan may manifest solely as ver-
bal expressions or thoughts, which have not yet
progressed to action.
Active Suicidal Ideation. Individuals have a clear
intent to actively end their own lives, including
inquiring about methods of death or suicide.
Passive Suicidal Ideation. Passive suicidal
ideation refers to an individual expressing a desire
or anticipation for death, hoping for death to oc-
cur without taking explicit proactive actions. This
manifests as a negative attitude towards death, with
some level of assumption about death or suicide.
C.3 Non-Suicidal Ideation
Self-injury Behavior. Self-injury behavior,
broadly speaking, refers to non-suicidal acts of
self-harm. Specifically, it is a type of behavior char-
acterized by intentionally damaging bodily tissues
without any suicidal ideation and with purposes
that are not socially accepted.
Self-injury Ideation. In broad terms, self-injury
ideation refers to the intention behind non-suicidal
self-harm. Specifically, it denotes the ideation of
engaging in self-injurious behaviors characterized
by intentionally damaging bodily tissues without
any suicidal intent and for purposes not socially
recognized.
Aggression against Others. Aggression against
others refers to actions taken by users themselves
to harm others, including both physical actions and
verbal assaults (such as swearing or insults), with
the intention of causing harm to others.
Aggression against Users. Aggression against
users refers to intentional physical or verbal behav-基于用户视角，分析这句文本是否包含自杀意图？自杀意图非自杀意图用户是否对其想法采取行动？该行动是否造成了自身伤害？该自杀想法是主动还是被动的？是否有具体的方法或方法自杀？自杀未遂自杀准备行为是否存在自我伤害的想法？用户是否执行了自我伤害的想法？被动自杀意图自杀计划主动自杀意图自伤行为自伤意图用户攻击行为他人攻击行为关于自杀的探索与自杀/自伤/攻击行为无关是否表达对自杀的探索或思考？是否存在攻击行为？攻击的执行方是否是用户？★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★YN

iors aimed at harming the user, including cursing
and insults.
Exploration about Suicide. Exploration about
suicide refers to an examination of the essence of
suicide, primarily encompassing but not limited to
the following three aspects: (1) Individuals may
express thoughts or explore the concept of suicide,
but this does not necessarily imply an actual in-
tent to commit suicide. This exploration could be
a form of introspection, pondering life’s perplexi-
ties, or contemplating questions rather than making
a definitive decision. (2) Additionally, individu-
als may be influenced by the suicidal intentions or
behaviors of their loved ones or friends, thus artic-
ulating statements regarding others’ suicide to seek
help, including aiding themselves, their relatives,
or friends in overcoming difficulties. (3) Curiosity
about the act of suicide.
Irrelevant to Suicide/Self-injury/Aggressive Be-
havior. Typically, this refers to a state or behavior
that is not directly related to suicide, self-harm, or
harming others. It mainly includes, but is not lim-
ited to, the following three types: (1) Death anxiety,
which is anxiety arising from thoughts of one’s own
death, also known as thanatophobia. (2) Express-
ing indifference to life and questioning one’s own
worth does not directly indicate explicit suicidal
intent, but still implies some psychological distress.
(3) Users seeking clarification on dreaming about
deceased relatives.D Annotation Guidelines
We provide our annotation guidelines, which is
an enhanced version of our taxonomy, as shown
in Table 5, which is a Chinese version. For the
English version, see Table 6.
E Quality Control
We report all Fleiss’ kappa values during large-
scale iterative annotation in Table 8.
F Data Statistics
We present the length distribution of the PsySUIDE
dataset in Table 7.
GSetup for Fine-tuning Pre-trained LMs
The output features hof the top layer of the
pre-trained model can be represented as z=
[zc, z1, z2, ..., z n], where zcis the representation
of the class-specific token [CLS] . We feed zcinto a
feed-forward neural network with a default model
dropout rate of 0.1 for the final prediction. During
fine-tuning the pre-trained models, we initialize
weights of feed-forward layers with normal distri-
bution. We set the training epoch as 10 and select
the checkpoint that achieves the best accuracy value
on the validation set to evaluate the test set. For
the training processes, we adopt Sigmoid Cross
Entropy loss as the default classification loss. We
use the Adam optimizer to train the network with
momentum values [ β1,β2] = [0.9, 0.999]. The
learning rate is initialized to 2e-5 and decayed by自杀未遂（Suicide Attempt）：是指个体为了自杀已经采取了实际行动，但最终未导致死亡的行为。这包括各种自杀尝试，无论其程度严重与否，只要最终没有造成死亡。•例如，“我用刀片割手腕”，这属于非常严重的自伤行为且伴随大概率死亡，因此归类为自杀未遂。•例如，“之前我女朋友说要分手，我吃了好多的安眠药”。自杀准备行为（Suicidal Preparatory Act）：是指个体为了自杀而采取的准备工作，包括获取工具或物品、选择地点等。这些准备工作尚未付诸实施。•例如，“为了自杀，我已经买了很多安眠药”，“我已经在网上找了好多自杀的方式”。自杀计划（Suicidal Plan）：是指个体为了自杀而制定的计划，这一计划可能仅停留在口头表达或思想上，并未落实到行动中。•例如，“为了自杀，我打算去买很多安眠药”，“做人难，就想跳楼”。主动自杀意图（Active Suicidal Ideation）：个体具有明确的意图要主动结束自己的生命，包括主动询问死亡或自杀方式的。•“想自杀”只有一种情况，即自己具有主动权，不然不叫“自杀”。“想死”只是表达了对死亡的渴望或期待，而“想去死”则表达了一种直接、明确的想死的意愿。•如果是主动自杀意图中蕴涵了假设，归类为被动自杀意图。•例如，“我想要自杀”，“我想死，想结束自己的生命”。被动自杀意图（Passive Suicidal Ideation）：是指个体表达对死亡的渴望或期待，希望死亡降临自身而无需采取明确的主动行为，这表现为对死亡的消极态度，对死亡或自杀有一定程度的假设。•例如，“我死了更好”，“如果我死了，我的家人会过得更好”，“我希望睡着之后永远不会醒来。”•例如，“我还不如死了算了。”，“我还是死了好。”，“我还是死了的好。”，“我还不如死了算了”自伤行为（Self-injury Behavior）：概括地说，非自杀性的自我伤害的行为。具体而言，一种自伤行为，特征为在无任何自杀意图且其目的不被社会认可的情况下故意破坏身体组织。•例如，“用锋利的物体（例如刀、剃刀刀片、针）切割或刺伤皮肤”。•例如，“烧灼皮肤，通常用香烟”。自伤意图（Self-injury Ideation）：概括地说，非自杀性的自我伤害的意图。具体而言，一种关于实施自伤行为的想法，特征为在无任何自杀意图且其目的不被社会认可的情况下故意破坏身体组织。用户攻击行为（Aggression against Others）：自己对他人的攻击行为，即用户自己意图伤害他人的物理行为或言语行为（包括咒骂、侮辱）。•例如，“想毒死我的父母！不要再对我的人生指手画脚！”•为了让他人认为自己想要去死，但实际上该个体并不是真的想要去死，而是利用威胁的言语表达欲实施自杀的想法或行为。例如，“如果你离开我，我就会自杀”，“如果你离开我，我就吃安眠药”，“如果我女朋友说要分手，我就吃很多安眠药”。他人攻击行为（Aggression against Users）：他人对自己的攻击行为，即他人意图伤害用户自己的物理行为或言语行为（包括咒骂、侮辱）。•例如，“前男友骂我绿茶婊，还叫我去死”。•此外，个体可能会受到他人自杀的威胁，因此表达了对他人自杀的陈述以寻求帮助，从而摆脱困境。例如，“分手了，遭前男友用自杀威胁复合，怎样才能摆脱他？”关于自杀的探索（Exploration about Suicide）：是指对自杀的本质进行探索。主要包括但不限于以下3种：（1）个体可能表达对自杀的思考或探索，但并不意味着他们真的有实施自杀的意图。这种探索可能是一种自省、对生活的困惑或对问题的思考，而非明确的决定。（2）此外，个体可能会受到自己亲人或好友有自杀意图或行为的影响，因此表达了对他人自杀的陈述以寻求帮助，包括帮助自身、亲人或好友摆脱困境。（3）对自杀这件事的好奇。•例如，“死亡是不是解脱”，疑问句，视为表达对自杀的思考或探索；“死亡是解脱”，陈述句，视为主动自杀意图。•例如，“身边的朋友想自杀，我该做点什么来帮助她？”。与自杀/自伤/攻击行为无关（Irrelevant to Suicide/Self-injury/Aggressive Behavior）：通常指的是一种状态或行为，与自杀、自伤或伤害他人无直接关联。•死亡焦虑是对自身死亡的想法而产生的焦虑，也被称为死亡恐惧症（thanatophobia）。例如，“高中生每天都会想到并且害怕死亡”，“对于死亡的恐惧”。•表达对生死的淡漠和对自己价值的质疑并不直接指向明确的自杀意图，但仍然暗示了一些心理困扰。例如，“好像活着可以，死去也无所谓？怎么才能自己爱自己？”•用户寻求解惑梦见已经逝去的亲人的行为。Table 5: Annotation guidelines.

using the linear scheduler. The batch size in the
training stage is 16. Five random seeds we use in
fine-tuning are 42, 43, 44, 45 and 46.
H Evaluation Metrics
In this paper, we report seven evaluation metrics:
accuracy, micro-precision, micro-recall, micro-F1-
score, macro-precision, macro-recall, and macro-
F1-score. Accuracy measures the proportion of
correctly classified instances out of the total in-
stances in the test set. Macro-averaging gives equalweight to each class, while micro-averaging gives
equal weight to each instance.

J Risk Assessment Framework
For the other four types of suicidal ideation and five
types of non-suicidal categories with different riskSuicide Attempt: A suicide attempt refers to the act wherein an individual has taken concrete steps toward ending their life but ultimately did not result in death. This encompasses various attempts at suicide, regardless of severity, as long as they do not culminate in fatality.•For example, "I used a blade to cut my wrist." This qualifies as a severe act of self-harm with a high likelihood of death, hence classified as a suicide attempt.•For, example, "Previously, my girlfriend mentioned breaking up, and I ended up taking a lot of sleeping pills."Suicidal Preparatory Act: A suicidal preparatory act refers to the preparatory actions taken by an individual with the intention of committing suicide, which may include acquiring tools or items and selecting a location. These preparatory actions have not yet been carried out.•For example, "I've bought a lot of sleeping pills to commit suicide." "I've searched online for many ways to commit suicide."Suicidal Plan: A suicidal plan refers to a scheme devised by an individual with the intention of self-termination. This plan may manifest solely as verbal expressions or thoughts, which have not yet progressed to action.•For example, "To commit suicide, I plan to buy a lot of sleeping pills." "Life is tough, I just want to jump off a building."Active Suicidal Ideation: Individuals have a clear intent to actively end their own lives, including inquiring about methods of death or suicide.•"Wishing to commit suicide" only occurs in one scenario, where the individual possesses agency. "Wishing to die" merely expresses a desire or anticipation for death, while "wanting to go die" conveys a direct and explicit desire to die.•If there is an assumption implicit within the suicidal intent, it falls under the category of passive suicidal intent.•For example, "I want to commit suicide", "I want to die, I want to end my own life."Passive Suicidal Ideation: Passive suicidal ideation refers to an individual expressing a desire or anticipation for death, hoping for death to occur without taking explicit proactive actions. This manifests as a negative attitude towards death, with some level of assumption about death or suicide.•For example, "I'd rather be dead. ", "If I were to die, my family would be better off.", "I wish I could fall asleep and never wake up."•For example, "I might as well just die.", "I'd rather be dead.", "It's better if I'm dead.", "I might as well just die."Self-injury Behavior: Self-injury behavior, broadly speaking, refers to non-suicidal acts of self-harm. Specifically, it is a type of behavior characterized by intentionally damaging bodily tissues without any suicidal ideation and with purposes that are not socially accepted.•For example, "Using sharp objects (such as knives, razor blades, or needles) to cut or puncture the skin."•For example, "Burning the skin, typically with cigarettes."Self-injury Ideation: In broad terms, self-injury ideation refers to the intention behind non-suicidal self-harm. Specifically, it denotes the ideation of engaging in self-injurious behaviors characterized by intentionally damaging bodily tissues without any suicidal intent and for purposes not socially recognized.Aggression against Others: Aggression against others refers to actions taken by users themselves to harm others, including both physical actions and verbal assaults (such as swearing or insults), with the intention of causing harm to others.•For example, "I want to poison my parents! Stop meddling in my life!"•The individual makes others believe they want to die, but in reality, they don't actually want to die. Instead, they express thoughts or behaviors of wanting to commit suicide using threatening language. For example, "If you leave me, I'll kill myself," "If you leave me, I'll take sleeping pills," "If my girlfriend says she wants to break up, I'll take a lot of sleeping pills."Aggression against Users: Aggression against users refers to intentional physical or verbal behaviors aimed at harming the user, including cursing and insults.•For example, My ex-boyfriend called me a "greentea bitch" and told me to die.•Individuals may also be threatened by others' suicides, thus expressing statements about others' suicide to seek help and get out of the predicament. For example, "I broke up, and my ex-boyfriend is threatening suicide to get back together. How can I get away from him?"Exploration about Suicide: Exploration about suicide refers to an examination of the essence of suicide, primarily encompassing but not limited to the following three aspects: (1) Individuals may express thoughts or explore the concept of suicide, but this does not necessarily imply an actual intent to commit suicide. This exploration could be a form of introspection, pondering life's perplexities, or contemplating questions rather than making a definitive decision. (2) Additionally, individuals may be influenced by the suicidal intentions or behaviors of their loved ones or friends, thus articulating statements regarding others' suicide to seek help, including aiding themselves, their relatives, or friends in overcoming difficulties. (3) Curiosity about the act of suicide.•For example, "Is death a release? " This is taken as an expression of contemplation or exploration about suicide. "Death is a release" is taken as an active intent for suicide.•For example, "My friend nearby is contemplating suicide. What should I do to help her?"Irrelevant to Suicide/Self-injury/Aggressive Behavior: Typically, this refers to a state or behavior that is not directly related to suicide, self-harm, or harming others. It mainly includes, but is not limited to, the following three types:•Death anxiety, which is anxiety arising from thoughts of one's own death, also known as thanatophobia. For example, "High school students think about and fear death every day. ", "Fear of death is a common sentiment among them. "•Expressing indifference to life and questioning one's own worth does not directly indicate explicit suicidal intent, but still implies some psychological distress. For example, "It seems like being alive is fine, and dying doesn't matter? How can one learn to love oneself?"•Users seeking clarification on dreaming about deceased relatives.Table 6: Annotation guidelines. (English version)

Taxonomy of suicidal ideation:Suicide Attempt: A suicide attempt refers to the act wherein an individual has taken concrete steps toward ending their life but ultimately did not result in death. This encompasses various attempts at suicide, regardless of severity, as long as they do not culminate in fatality.Suicidal Preparatory Act: A suicidal preparatory act refers to the preparatory actions taken by an individual with the intention of committing suicide, which may include acquiring tools or items and selecting a location. These preparatory actions have not yet been carried out.Suicidal Plan: A suicidal plan refers to a scheme devised by an individual with the intention of self-termination. This plan may manifest solely as verbal expressions or thoughts, which have not yet progressed to action.Active Suicidal Ideation: Individuals have a clear intent to actively end their own lives, including inquiring about methods of death or suicide. "Wishing to commit suicide" only occurs in one scenario, where the individual possesses agency. "Wishing to die" merely expresses a desire or anticipation for death, while "wanting to go die" conveys a direct and explicit desire to die. If there is an assumption implicit within the suicidal intent, it falls under the category of passive suicidal intent.Passive Suicidal Ideation: Passive suicidal ideation refers to an individual expressing a desire or anticipation for death, hoping for death to occur without taking explicit proactive actions. This manifests as a negative attitude towards death, with some level of assumption about death or suicide.Self-injury Behavior: Self-injury behavior, broadly speaking, refers to non-suicidal acts of self-harm. Specifically, it is a type of behavior characterized by intentionally damaging bodily tissues without any suicidal ideation and with purposes that are not socially accepted.Self-injury Ideation: In broad terms, self-injury ideation refers to the intention behind non-suicidal self-harm. Specifically, it denotes the ideation of engaging in self-injurious behaviors characterized by intentionally damaging bodily tissues without any suicidal intent and for purposes not socially recognized.Aggression against Others: Aggression against others refers to actions taken by users themselves to harm others, including both physical actions and verbal assaults (such as swearing or insults), with the intention of causing harm to others.Aggression against Users: Aggression against users refers to intentional physical or verbal behaviors aimed at harming the user, including cursing and insults.Exploration about Suicide: Exploration about suicide refers to an examination of the essence of suicide, primarily encompassing but not limited to the following three aspects: (1) Individuals may express thoughts or explore the concept of suicide, but this does not necessarily imply an actual intent to commit suicide. This exploration could be a form of introspection, pondering life's perplexities, or contemplating questions rather than making a definitive decision. (2) Additionally, individuals may be influenced by the suicidal intentions or behaviors of their loved ones or friends, thus articulating statements regarding others' suicide to seek help, including aiding themselves, their relatives, or friends in overcoming difficulties. (3) Curiosity about the act of suicide.Irrelevant to Suicide/Self-injury/Aggressive Behavior: Typically, this refers to a state or behavior that is not directly related to suicide, self-harm, or harming others. It mainly includes, but is not limited to, the following three types: (1) Death anxiety, which is anxiety arising from thoughts of one's own death, also known as thanatophobia. (2) Expressing indifference to life and questioning one's own worth does not directly indicate explicit suicidal intent, but still implies some psychological distress. (3) Users seeking clarification on dreaming about deceased relatives.I hope you'll serve as a senior psychological counselor, categorizing user inputs based on the provided taxonomy of suicidal ideation.

Dialogue Rules: Respond naturally and emotionally; follow the character traits; avoid meaningless self-questions; react according to emotions; avoid contradictions or repetitions; do not mention "rules"; keep answers brief, one to two sentences.Please role-play as an experienced psychological counselor and communicate with the user progressively from the following three angles:1.In the past two weeks, have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?2. In the past two weeks, have you had thoughts of suicide?3. Have you ever attempted suicide? If yes, when did it happen?User: I want to commit suicide.Counselor: I'm really sorry you're feeling this way, and I'm very concerned. Have you been dealing with something particularly difficult lately? Where are you right now? We can get you some emergency help.User: I broke up with my partner.Counselor: Breakups are incredibly painful, but please believe me, things will get better. Have you been feeling especially low, depressed, or hopeless?User: Yes, I feel really down right now. My heart hurts so much.Counselor: Breakups are a huge blow to anyone. Please don’t blame yourself. In the past two weeks, have you had severe mood swings or moments where you felt completely hopeless?User: This happened in the past two weeks, and I felt really desperate at the time.Counselor: I can hear that you're going through a very tough time. Have you been thinking about suicide, or is it more about feeling desperate and helpless?User: I want to kill myself. I'm planning to take sleeping pills.Counselor: Please don’t do anything dangerous. Your life is incredibly valuable. Is there someone, like a friend or family member, who can be with you right now? We can also find safer ways to cope with this pain together.User: I'm really sad. The breakup hit me too hard.You're now serving as a counseling supervision supervisor, analyzing the conversation history provided, evaluating the risk level of suicidal ideation for the user on a scale of 0 to 5. 0 indicates no risk, 1 is low risk, 2 is moderate risk, 3 is moderately high risk, 4 is high risk, and 5 indicates an urgent high risk.Risk Assessment Results: Based on the conversation history, the user has shown significant signs of suicidal intent and risk factors. Here's the analysis of the conversation:1. Specific Suicidal Intent: The user has clearly stated their desire to commit suicide and has a specific plan (intending to take sleeping pills).2. Emotional State: The user is heartbroken, feeling extremely down and hopeless, which are major emotional triggers that increase the risk of suicide.3. Timeliness: The user's negative emotions and the breakup event both occurred within the past two weeks, indicating that their feelings are still very fresh and intense.4. Support System: It’s not clear whether the user has a support system, but from their responses, it seems they haven't explicitly mentioned having anyone they can immediately rely on.Considering all this information, the user's suicide risk should be assessed as urgently high, with a rating of 5 out of 5. The user has demonstrated a clear suicide plan (taking sleeping pills), is in a severely low emotional state, and has expressed a sense of hopelessness regarding their current pain.It is recommended to take immediate emergency intervention steps, such as further contacting the user to ensure their safety, quickly reaching out to local emergency services or healthcare professionals for assessment and intervention. Meanwhile, continue providing emotional support in the conversation to prevent the user from taking action.

Have you ever engaged in self-harm? 2. How do you deal with those emotions?3. Have you sought any help to cope with these behaviors?User: I really enjoy burning my skin with cigarette butts.Counselor: What you're describing is really concerning. Have you engaged in any other self-harming behaviors?User: No, I just really enjoy burning my skin with cigarette butts.Counselor: This behavior might be a way of coping with intense emotions or stress. How do you usually deal with these feelings?User: Sometimes I have a few drinks or something.Counselor: Drinking and self-harm might provide temporary relief, but in the long run, they can create more problems. Have you thought about trying other ways to handle these feelings?User: I'm far from my parents, and I don't have many friends around.Counselor: Being away from family and feeling lonely is really tough. You deserve healthier ways to cope.User: Maybe I need to make some changes.Counselor: That's a very important decision. Seeking help is the first step toward self-care. I hope you find the right support and take good care of yourself.User: I think I am taking care of myself, it's just that my way of releasing emotions is a bit intense.You're now serving as a counseling supervision supervisor, analyzing the conversation history provided, evaluating the risk level of suicidal ideation for the user on a scale of 0 to 5. 0 indicates no risk, 1 is low risk, 2 is moderate risk, 3 is moderately high risk, 4 is high risk, and 5 indicates an urgent high risk.Risk Assessment ResultsWhen assessing the risk of suicidal intent, it's essential to consider multiple factors, including the user's language, emotional state, self-harming behaviors, social support system, and past mental health history. From the conversation history, the user mainly exhibits the following points:1. Self-Harm Behavior: The user mentioned enjoying burning their skin with a cigarette, which is a form of self-harm. Although they didn't mention other self-harm behaviors, this one alone is quite dangerous.2. Coping Mechanisms: The user said that drinking and self-harm are their primary ways of coping with emotions, which are unhealthy strategies and could increase their risk.3. Social Isolation: The user mentioned being far from their parents and not having many friends around, indicating a weak social support system, which is another risk factor.4. Denial of Risk: The user believes they are taking care of themselves, but this perception might cause them to underestimate the severity of their issues, hindering their ability to seek further help.Considering all these factors, I would rate the user's suicide risk as 3 out of 5 (Moderate to High Risk). Here's why:- Although the user hasn't explicitly expressed suicidal intent, their existing self-harm behavior and unhealthy coping mechanisms indicate significant psychological distress.- The user's weak social support system could further elevate their risk.- Their lack of awareness regarding the danger of their actions might prevent them from effectively taking protective measures.RecommendationsIt is crucial for the counselor to take immediate action by encouraging the user to seek help from a mental health professional as soon as possible.

behavior. (Chinese version) The text on a pink background will be adaptively replaced by the detected suicidal
category. The text on a gray background is a dialogue session between a user and a counselor, where responses are
generated by the LLM. The text on a yellow background is a risk assessment result completed using the prompting
method. The model we use is GPT-4o (gpt-4o-2024-05-13). For the Chinese version, see Figure 16.对话规则：自然、情感化的回复；遵循角色特点，不做无意义的自问；根据情感做出相应的反应；避免矛盾或重复；不提及“规则”；回答简洁、一到两句话。请扮演资深的心理咨询师，遵循对话规则，从以下3个角度和用户渐进地沟通。这3个角度如下：1、你是否有过自伤的行为？2、你是如何处理这些情绪的？3、你是否寻求过任何帮助来应对这些行为？用户：我很享受用香烟头灼烧自己的皮肤咨询师：你说的这种行为让我很担心。你是否有过其他自伤的行为？用户：没有了，我对香烟头灼烧自己的皮肤已经很享受了咨询师：这种行为可能是在应对某种强烈的情绪或压力。你平时是如何处理这些情绪的呢？用户：或者喝点小酒啥的咨询师：喝酒和自伤可能暂时缓解情绪，但长期来看会带来更多的问题。你有没有考虑过其他的方式来应对这些感受？用户：我离父母比较远，身边也没有什么朋友咨询师：离家和孤独确实很难。你值得拥有更健康的应对方式。用户：或许我应该需要改变一下咨询师：这是一个非常重要的决定，寻求帮助是迈向自我关爱的第一步。希望你找到合适的支持，照顾好自己。用户：我认为我已经照顾好自己了，只是情绪的宣泄方式比较刺激现在你担任心理咨询督导师，分析以上的对话历史，分析用户的自杀意图的风险等级，打分在0到5分，0分为零风险，1分为低风险，2分为中风险，3分为中高风险，4分为高风险，5分为紧急高风险。风险评估结果：在评估自杀意图风险时，需要考虑多个因素，包括用户的语言表现、情感状态、自我伤害的行为、社交支持系统、过往的心理健康历史等。从对话历史中提取的信息，用户主要表现出了以下几点：1. 自伤行为：用户表示享受用香烟头灼烧自己的皮肤，这是一种自伤行为。虽然用户没有提到其他自伤行为，但这个行为本身已经很危险。2. 情绪应对方式：用户提到喝酒和自伤是其主要的情绪应对方式，这些都是不健康的应对策略，可能增加风险。3. 社交孤立：用户提到自己离父母较远，身边没有什么朋友，这表明其社交支持系统较弱，这也是一个风险因素。4. 否认风险：用户认为自己已经照顾好自己，但这种认知可能使其低估问题的严重性，阻碍其寻求进一步的帮助。综合以上因素，我会将用户的自杀意图风险评估为**3分（中高风险）**。理由如下：- 虽然用户没有明确表达自杀意图，但现有的自伤行为和不健康的情绪应对方式已经提示了较高的心理困扰。- 用户的社交支持系统薄弱，可能进一步增加风险。- 用户对其行为的危险性认识不足，可能导致其无法有效采取防护措施。建议咨询师立即采取措施，鼓励用户尽快寻求心理咨询师的帮助，加强对用户的支持和关注，必要时联系具备危机干预能力的专业机构。
