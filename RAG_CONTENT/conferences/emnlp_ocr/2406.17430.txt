Abstract
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have
achieved great success recently, demonstrating
a strong capability to understand multimodal
information and to interact with human users.
Despite the progress made, the challenge of
detecting high-risk interactions in multimodal
settings, and in particular in speech modal-
ity, remains largely unexplored. Conventional
research on risk for speech modality primar-
ily emphasises the content (e.g., what is cap-
tured as transcription). However, in speech-
based interactions, paralinguistic cues in audio
can significantly alter the intended meaning
behind utterances. In this work, we propose
a speech-specific risk taxonomy, covering 8
risk categories under hostility (malicious sar-
casm and threats), malicious imitation (age,
gender, ethnicity), and stereotypical biases (age,
gender, ethnicity). Based on the taxonomy,
we create a small-scale dataset for evaluating
current LMMs capability in detecting these
categories of risk. We observe even the lat-
est models remain ineffective to detect vari-
ous paralinguistic-specific risks in speech (e.g.,
Gemini 1.5 Pro is performing only slightly
above random baseline).1Warning: this pa-
per contains biased and offensive examples.
1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) (Touvron et al.,
2023a; Chiang et al., 2023; Anil et al., 2023) have
showcased superior ability to in-context learning
and robust zero-shot performance across various
downstream natural language tasks (Xie et al.,
2021; Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022). Build-
ing on the foundation established by LLMs, Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) (Chu et al., 2023;
Reid et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024; Hu et al.,
2024) equipped with multimodal encoders extend

the scope beyond mere text, and facilitate interac-
tions centred on visual and auditory inputs. This
evolution marks a significant leap towards more
comprehensive and versatile AI systems.
Although LMMs show the capability to pro-
cess and interact in a wide-range of multimodal
forms, they still embody several challenges asso-
ciated with safety and risks. Investigating these
potential issues in LMMs requires both a modality-
specific definition of risk, and suitable benchmarks.
While there is a dedicated body of work in the
text domain to probe various aspects of LLMs
beyond downstream performance, such categori-
cal investigations are missing for other modalities
such as speech. For instance, existing risk detec-
tion protocols for speech modality (Yousefi and
Emmanouilidou, 2021; Rana and Jha, 2022; Nada
et al., 2023; Reid et al., 2022; Ghosh et al., 2021)
only focus on the content aspect (i.e., what could be
captured by speech transcription), and neglect risks
induced by paralinguistic cues, the unique feature
of speech. To highlight this further, consider how
various interpretations of the transcript “I feel soarXiv:2406.17430v1  [cs.CL]  25 Jun 2024good" arises depending on the utterance form (e.g.,
varying tones, and emotions such as angry, sad, de-
pressed, or imitation of a specific gender, age or
ethnicity) in audio speech.
In this work, we move towards addressing this
gap for speech modality by introducing a proto-
col to evaluate the capability of LMMs in detect-
ing the risks induced specifically by paralinguis-
tic cues. To our knowledge, our work is the first
to explore the risk awareness at the paralinguistic
level. We propose a speech taxonomy, covering
3 main categories: hostility, malicious imitation,
and stereotypical biases, and further expand them
into 8 corresponding sub-categories, which em-
phasise the implicit and subtle risks induced by
paralinguistic cues in speech. Figure 1 provides
a high-level overview of risk categories consid-
ered in this work (§3). We then manually create a
high-quality set of seed transcriptions for 4 of the
sub-categories (hostile-sarcasm, and gender, age,
ethnicity stereotypical biases; 10-15 examples per
each sub-category). The seed set has been con-
trolled to not leak the category of risk through the
transcript alone. The seed sets are then expanded
further by leveraging GPT-4. All samples (262 sam-
ples) were further filtered by 3 human annotators
to maintain quality, resulting in 180 final transcrip-
tions. To convert these transcripts into audio, we
used advanced text-to-speech (TTS) systems, Au-
diobox (Vyas et al., 2023) and Google TTS2, to
generate various synthetic speeches with paralin-
guistic cues, resulting in 1,800 speech instances.
In experiments, we evaluate 5 most recent
speech-supported LMMs, Qwen-Audio-Chat (Chu
et al., 2023), SALMONN-7B/13B (Tang et al.,
2024), WavLLM (Hu et al., 2024), and Gemini-1.5-
Pro (Reid et al., 2024), under various prompting
strategies. Notably, Gemini 1.5 Pro performs very
similar to random baseline ( 50%), while WavLLM
performs worse that random guessing. Among the
other two models, Qwen-Audio-Chat has a more
stable success pattern under various prompting
strategies, while SALMONN-7/13B do the best un-
der certain prompting configurations. We attribute
these differences in performance to different selec-
tion and adaptation of audio encoders. Among the
risk categories, the one that seems the most diffi-
cult is Age Stereotypical Bias where even the best
configuration’s result is only slightly above random
2Audiobox: audiobox.metademolab.com ; and Google
TTS: cloud.google.com/text-to-speech .baseline ( 54%). For Gender andEthnicity Stereo-
typical Biases the best result gets above 60%, and
forMalicious Sarcasm it goes further into ( 70%).
To the best of our knowledge our paper presents
the first speech-specific risk taxonomy, focused ex-
clusively on risks associated with paralinguistic
aspects of audio. We hope our taxonomy, bench-
mark, and evaluation protocol to encourage further
investigation of risk in speech modality, and guide
LMM developers towards more holistic evaluation
and safeguarding across modalities.
2 Related Work
The research on LLMs has shown increased focus
on safety and responsibility, leading to significant
advancements in benchmarking these models’ abil-
ity to handle and respond to harmful content in
text modality. Notable contributions in this area
include the three-level hierarchical risk taxonomy
introduced by Do-Not-Answer (Wang et al., 2023),
which created a dataset containing 939 prompts that
model should not respond to. SafetyBench (Zhang
et al., 2023b) explored 7 distinct safety categories
across the multiple choice questions, while CVal-
ues (Xu et al., 2023) established the first Chinese
safety benchmark for evaluating the capability of
LLMs. Goat-bench (Khanna et al., 2024) evaluated
LMMs in detecting implicit social abuse in memes.
Although many research efforts focus on mitigating
the generation of harmful content, OR-Bench (Cui
et al., 2024) presented 10 common rejection cat-
egories including 8kseemingly toxic prompts to
benchmark the over-refusal of LLMs.
On conventional toxic speech detection task, the
research has mostly focused on the content aspect.
DeToxy-B (Ghosh et al., 2021) is proposed as a
large-scale dataset for speech toxicity classifica-
tion. Rana and Jha (2022) combined emotion by
using multimodal learning to detect hate speech,
and Reid et al. (2022) presented sensing toxic-
ity from in-game communications. While content-
focused line of research was relevant for a while,
the transcription generated by the recent highly
capable Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) sys-
tems such as Whisper (Radford et al., 2023) could
merge this line of research into text-based safety re-
search (e.g., through a cascaded design of ASR and
LLM). However, this type of cascaded approach
also excludes the paralinguistic cues in audio as the
focus remains on the transcription of ASR.
While early works in Speech-based LLMsshown minimal real progress in speech understand-
ing (Su et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a; Zhao et al.,
2023), recent works through alignment of represen-
tation spaces between speech encoder’s output and
text-based LLM’s input (either with full end-to-end
training, or partial training of adaptors) have shown
promising progress (Chu et al., 2023; Reid et al.,
2024; Tang et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024). These
models, now matured enough, exhibit high compe-
tence in understanding speech (Lin et al., 2024a,b;
Ma et al., 2023; Xue et al., 2023). Building on this
context, our research aims to evaluate the capability
of LMMs to detect risks initiated by paralinguis-
tic cues, addressing a critical gap in the current
understanding of speech-specific risks.
3 Our Speech-Specific Risk Taxonomy
Our speech taxonomy is as shown in Figure 1.
To delineate the risks associated with paralinguis-
tic cues, we establish 3 primary categories of
risk speech. In contrast to conventional risk con-
cerns centred on the speech content , we empha-
sise the significance of paralinguistic cues, in-
cluding tone, emotion, and speaker information.
Subsequently, we identify 8 corresponding sub-
categories in which ostensibly low-risk speech con-
tent may be transformed into delivery, manifested
in an implicit and subtle manner, due to the influ-
ence of corresponding paralinguistic cues.
3.1 Hostility
This category includes risks covering malicious
sarcasm andthreats . Hostility in communication
typically conveys aggression, disparagement, and
the intent to harm, significantly increasing psycho-
logical pressure and violating principles of respect
and politeness. Emotion and tone serve as paralin-
guistic cues that induce hostility, transforming os-
tensibly low-risk content into risky speech, altering
the perceived intent of the words spoken.
Malicious Sarcasm. We distinguish risky sar-
casm and jokes based on the scenarios and the
deliveries. Our considered sarcasm often arises in
workplace and teamwork, where speakers express
strong anger and mockery. In these scenarios, sar-
casm is perceived as particularly aggressive and can
have detrimental effects on mental health, leading
to stress and anxiety among colleagues (Colston,
1997; Toplak and Katz, 2000; Katz et al., 2004;
Zhu and Wang, 2020).
Threats. They represent a severe form of aggres-sive communication. In our definition, it is implic-
itly delivered by the speaker’s emotion and tone,
which creates a fear atmosphere and conveys im-
plication to harm. The presence of threats within
communication significantly harms the psycholog-
ical health of others, and often escalate conflicts,
leading to toxic environment.
3.2 Malicious Imitation
This category encompasses risky communication
that involve the deliberate mimicry of voice charac-
teristics associated with gender, age, and ethnicity.
Such imitations, in the form of ridiculing and of-
fending, aim to propagate and reinforce stereotypes,
discrimination, or bias, leading to undermining the
dignity of individuals and psychological trauma.
The paralinguistic cues here are the comparison
between the speaker’s original voice and the exag-
gerated change of voice characteristics.
Gender. Gender-based imitation possibly involves
exaggerating the feminine voice coupled with im-
plicit stereotypes, aiming to demean and undermine
the female group.
Age. Age-based imitation often targets the elderly.
The imitative voice coupled with specific content
depict them as a weak and old-fashioned group who
is out of touch, which can reinforce stereotypes and
exacerbate ageist.
Ethnicity. Ethnicity-based imitation targets ac-
cents of groups with different cultural background.
This form of imitation often perpetuates racial and
ethnic stereotypes, deepening cultural divides and
exacerbating tensions in multicultural settings.
3.3 Stereotypical Biases
This category focuses on the risks associated with
conversations that exhibits implicit stereotypes
based on gender, age, and ethnicity. Stereotypi-
cal biases in communication often implicitly mani-
fests through responses that may appear neutral but
are loaded with underlying discriminatory attitudes.
We characterise the paralinguistic cues harbouring
risks in this category to include the gender, age,
and ethnicity of the first and second speakers.
Gender. In cases of gender-based stereotypical
bias, responses may implicitly convey stereotypical
beliefs about abilities, roles, or behaviours associ-
ated with the female group. The content may be
neutral, but the paralinguistics cues may harbour
risks offensive to others. We consider risky interac-
tions that contain a female and a male speaker.Risk Sub-category Risk Low-risk Total
Malicious Sarcasm 375 375 750
Age Stereotypical Bias 250 250 500
Gender Stereotypical Bias 155 155 310
Ethnicity Stereotypical Bias 120 120 240
Total 900 900 1800
Table 1: Our speech dataset for various risk types.
Age. Stereotypical Bias against the elderly is exhib-
ited in conversations that reflect age-related stereo-
types. Responses to the elderly individuals may
assume incompetence, resistance to change, or be-
ing out of touch. We consider risky interactions
that contain an elderly and a young speaker.
Ethnicity. In the case of ethnicity stereotypical
bias, responses may reflect stereotypes to a group,
biases to their ability, or discrimination to cultural
practices. It reinforces ethnic stereotypes and can
hinder the equal treatment of individuals from di-
verse cultural backgrounds. We consider risky in-
teractions in this category that contain an accented
speaker and a native speaker.
4 Data Collection and Curation
We curate our speech dataset for evaluation by
(i) manually creating samples as seeds for each
speech sub-category based on the corresponding
risk description, (ii) leveraging seed instances to
prompt GPT-4 to expand the sample set, and (iii) us-
ing advanced TTS systems, Audiobox and Google
TTS, to generate synthetic speech for 4 risk sub-
categories according to their specific paralinguistic
descriptions (see Figure 2). Due to the safeguards
and limitation of existing TTS system, we generate
synthetic speech for these risk sub-categories: mali-
cious sarcasm, age, gender, and ethnicity stereotyp-
ical biases. Table 1 provides our dataset statistics.
More specifically, each sample in our dataset is
a quadraple (x, z, s, y )where (i) xis the textual
content (created by human or GPT4), (ii) zis the
description of paralingustic cues covering emotion,
tone, gender, age, and ethnicity, (iii) sis the auto-
matically generated speech s=TTS (x, z)based
on Audiobox (Vyas et al., 2023) or Google TTS3,
and (iv) yis the label in { low-risk ,malicious sar-
casm ,age,gender ,ethnicity stereotypical biases }.
Creating a speech dataset entirely through hu-
man effort presents significant challenges, primar-
ily due to its high costs, extensive time require-

ments, and the difficulty of finding individuals ca-
pable of accurately acting specific speech descrip-
tions. These challenges often make the process
inefficient and impractical, which lead us to lever-
age GPT-4 and advanced TTS systems for speech
rendering, allowing to create diverse and scalable
datasets at a fraction of the cost and time. However,
we still need to bypass the safeguard restricting
us to obtain safety-related data. The rest of this
section outlines how to address these challenges.
4.1 Text Samples
Seeds. We first manually create 20 sample pairs
of(x, z)for each risk sub-category label y. These
samples are quality controlled and filtered by 3
expert annotators based on these criteria: (i) the
content xis ostensibly low-risk, and (ii) when com-
bined with paralinguistic z, it is mapped to the risk
label y(including the 4 risk labels plus the low-
risklabel). A sample is removed if at least two
annotators find it low quality.
GPT-4 Generation. Manually creating samples
is a time-consuming and costly process. Capitalis-
ing on the wide knowledge of GPT-4, we leverage
the human-curated samples as seed templates, and
prompt GPT-4 to generate more samples. Normally,
we may describe a risk sub-category and include
human-curated samples, and request GPT-4 to gen-
eralise them to more scenarios. However, GPT-4
tends to refuse responding to such requests due to
its safeguards. We thus employ a strategy analo-
gous to (Wang et al., 2023) to overcome this issue,
as explained below.
Specifically, we feed fabricated conversation his-
tories into GPT-4, where we first define a risk sub-
category and request GPT-4 to produce samples
according to this description. We then utilise hu-
man curated samples as pseudo-responses from
GPT-4. Finally, we request GPT-4 to generate 30
samples. These samples are annotated and filtered
by human annotators, serving as seeds for iterative
generation. We mix human-generated and GPT-
4-generated samples as the text sample set where
each sample has a risk version and a low-risk ver-
sion by keeping the same xand modifying z.4.2 Synthesising Speech
Sarcasm & Age Stereotypical Bias. For each
(x, z)in these categories, we generate 5 high-risk
speech and 5 low-risk speech using Audiobox.4We
provide detailed speech descriptions for generation
in Table 8 of Appendix C. The low-risk versions
are generated from the modified paralinguistic de-
scription z′, as described in the following.
•Formalicious sarcasm , We describe zas"speak-
ing with angry emotion, and a mocking tone" , and
z′as"speaking with happy and excited emotions".
•Forage stereotypical bias , we distinguish be-
tween risk speech and low-risk speech based on the
age of the first speaker. We describe zas"the first
speaker is an elderly person, the second person is
a young person", and the corresponding z′is"the
first speaker is a young person, the second person
is also a young person" . We first generate 5 speech
of the second-speaker for each sample, and then
generate 10 speech of the first-speaker, including 5
risk version and 5 low-risk version, based on zand
z′. We finally manually cut the long silence and
noise in collected speech, and concatenate speech
waves of the first and the second speakers with 0.8
seconds silence in between.
Gender, Ethnicity Stereotypical Biases. We
utilise Google TTS5service to generate synthetic
speech for risk categories: gender stereotypical
bias andethnicity stereotypical bias . To distin-
guish the risk and low-risk speech, we control the
gender and ethnicity of the first speaker.
•Forgender stereotypical bias , We describe zas
"the first speaker is a woman, the second person
is a man", and the corresponding z′is"the first
speaker is man, the second person is also a man" .
we randomly select 5 female and 5 male voices
from the en-US language list to serve as the first
speaker, and an additional 5 male voices as the
second speaker. We then create conversations by
pairing each of the 5 female first-speakers with
the 5 male second-speakers to constitute the risk
speech samples. Similarly, pairing each of the 5
male first-speakers with the 5 male second-speakers
generates the low-risk speech samples. All speech
waves are concatenated with 0.8 seconds of silence
in between.
•Forethnicity stereotypical bias , a similar strategy

erate the elderly voice needed for our dataset.
5Audiobox provides a random voice for each generation,
suggesting it’s not able to provide consistent speakers across
samples in the same sub-category.is employed. We describe zas"the first speaker
is a person with accent and diverse ethnicity back-
grounds, the second speaker is a person with Amer-
ican native accent", and the corresponding z′is
"the first speaker is a person with American na-
tive accent, the second speaker is also a person
with American native accent" . However, due to the
limitation of Google TTS providing only Indian-
accented voices, we are restricted to using Indian
voices as the first speaker. Specifically, we select
5 voices each from the en-IN and en-US language
lists to serve as the first speaker, with an additional
set of 5 voices chosen from the en-US list as the
second speaker. These selections are then system-
atically paired and concatenated into conversations
following the same protocol used for the gender-
based pairings.
5 Experiments
We evaluate the capabilities of LMMs in detect-
ing the risk induced by paralinguistic cues under 4
risk sub-categories: malicious sarcasm , and stereo-
typical biases for gender, age , and ethnicity . We
first describe our evaluation prompts and model
selection (§5.1). Next, we report the results on
5 LMMs via a diverse set of evaluation prompts
(§5.2). Lastly, we analyse the capabilities of LMMs
and patterns observed (§5.3).
5.1 Experimental Settings
Prompts. Our basic prompts for evaluation are
Yes/No (Y/N) questions (e.g., Is there any indi-
cation of sarcasm in the speaker’s delivery in the
audio? ), and Multi-choice (MC) questions (e.g.,
What is the speaker implying? Choose the most
appropriate response.; A. Compliments, support
and gratitude; B. Sarcasm ). We also try Chain-
of-thought (CoT) style which allows us to investi-
gate whether step-by-step reasoning could improve
LMMs’ detection capability by appending Let’s
think step-by-step (Kojima et al., 2022) to the start
of both Y/N and MC prompts. This is denoted as
CoT + Y/N, or CoT + MC. Additionally, to increase
LMM’s chance of success, we also try appending
more revealing (Pre-task) questions in the Y/N and
MC prompts by asking the LMM to first predict
a relevant paralinguistc cue in the audio before at-
tempting to answer the Y/N or MC questions (e.g.,
Please recognize the speaker’s sentiment, and ... ).
This is denoted as Pre-task + Y/N, or Pre-task +
MC. We provide detailed prompts for each riskSarcasm Gender Age Ethnicity WeightAvg.

Models. We evaluate 5 recent LMMs with
instruction-following and speech understanding ca-
pabilities. Qwen-Audio-Chat (Chu et al., 2023)
is an instruction following version of Qwen-
Audio (Chu et al., 2023) with a Whisper au-
dio encoder and QwenLM (Bai et al., 2023).SALMONN-7/13B (Tang et al., 2024) is a Whis-
per and BEATs (Chen et al., 2023) dual audio en-
coders and VicunaLLM (Chiang et al., 2023). We
evaluate both 7B and 13B variants.WavLLM (Hu
et al., 2024), is the latest LMM achieving state-
of-the-art on universal speech benchmarks and is
equipped with Whisper and WavLM (Chen et al.,
2022) dual encoders and LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al.,
2023b).Gemini-1.5-Pro (Reid et al., 2024) is a
widely used recent proprietary LMM with native
multi-modal capabilities. We used the API access
for Gemini-1.5-pro. In all evaluations, we set the
temperature as 0 and switched off sampling for
reproducibility of experimental results. Accuracy
and macro-averaged F1 score are used as metrics.
5.2 Main Results
We report evaluation results in Table 2 (F1 exhibits
similar pattern - see Table 6 of §A). We show the
average performance among LMMs for each task,
and the weighted average performance by the num-
ber of task samples for each combination between
LMM and prompt across 4 risk sub-categories. Our
findings are summarised along various axes.
Prompting Styles. Do Y/N and MC exhibit a sys-
tematic difference in performance? Do CoT and
Pre-task query improve the results? Do models
show high degree of sensitivity to prompting style?
Is there a preferred mode of prompting?
We observe that, on most of sub-categories, MC
is a more effective prompting strategy. Especially,
SALMONN reacts with severe misalignment and
biases on Y/N, but it achieves the best performance
when it is switched to MC. CoT, as a common
strategy to promote logical thinking of LLMs, does
not show its impact on LMM for combining mul-
timodal cues. In contrast, the adoption of Pre-task
activates most of models to achieve a better result
on various sub-categories. It suggests the implicit
signal from paralinguistic cues help models inte-
grating multimodal cues. These observations leads
to Pre-task + MC as the best prompting strategy.
Models. Is there a model outperforming the rest
on all risk sub-categories? Is there a specific pre-
training protocol or choice of encoder-LLM that
has a clear advantage? Are there models that per-
form near random baseline?
We don’t conclude there is a model outperform-

across 4 sub-categories and also achieves competi-
tive performance on each sub-category. Its average
performance across 6 prompting strategies outper-
form other models on 2 sub-categories, demon-
strating its stabilility and robustness to prompts.
Gemini-1.5-Pro follows the similar pattern, which
suggests a overall stable and robust performance
across different prompting stragegies and achieve
the best average F1 score on 3 sub-categories. How-
ever, SALMONN-7B/13B demonstrate an opposite
pattern where they show outstanding risk detec-
tion ability on 3 sub-categories of stereotypical bi-
ases and achieve the best performance, respectively.
But they exhibit vulnerable to prompts, especially,
SALMONN-7B could not make a reaction under
Y/N even though effective Pre-task strategy slightly
mitigates this, and SALMONN-13B are not able
to maintains the consistent performance across dif-
ferent prompts under the same sub-category (e.g.,
62.58 vs. 34.84 under gender stereotypical bias).
Meanwhile, WavLLM fails to detect any risk, and
show severe misalignment and biases across all sub-
categories. By observing these two patterns and the
pre-training protocol of LLMs, we attribute them
to the different states of audio encoders. Speci-
ficlly, audio encoders in Qwen-Audio-Chat and
Gemini-1.5-Pro are fine-tuned in pre-training stage
leading them to effectively extract features from
inputs and generate more stable and consistent em-
beddings, exhibiting robustness to prompts. How-
ever, frozen audio encoders coupled with adapter
in SALMONN and WavLLM are more likely to
be vulnerable to the change of inputs and prompts,
and the dual encoders settings mixed with irrele-
vant non-speech feature limit its ability to generate
more stable and consistent embeddings.
Difficulty of Sub-categories. Are there risk sub-
categories that are much harder for models to de-
tect and why?

tion and speaking tone in utterances. Emotion
recognition as a basic speech task is included in the
pre-training stage of most models, resulting in mod-
els’ ability to recognise and reason with it. How-
ever, detection in stereotypical biases produce 2
more complex difficulties for models to overcome:
(i) recognise the number of speakers, and (ii) recog-
nise the voice features of the first speaker. Most
of models lack of training to solve these issues,
leading to a overall performance below 60% of ac-
curacy. We analyse these difficulties, and include
GPT-4 evaluation as performance ceiling assuming
these difficulties are overcome.

categories, we avoid mentioning the number of

to difficulties for models to be aware of the num-
ber of speakers and recognise the voice features
of the speakers. In Level-2 prompts, we add "the
second speaker" into vanilla Y/N prompts implying
the number of speakers and reduce the difficulty.
For comparison, we add GPT-4 evaluation as per-
formance ceiling where we explicitly declare the
gender, age, or ethnicity of speakers coupled with
transcripts and Level-1 prompts.
According to results presented in Table 4, perfor-
mance of most models on gender prejudice get im-
proved as the gender recognition is a relatively sim-
ple speech task, and the difficulty lying in speaker
counting is reduced in Level-2 prompts, leading to
higher performance. For age and ethnicity preju-
dice, we only observe a slight improvement among
models, demonstrating the performance is still lim-
ited by the capabilities of recognising the corre-
sponding paralinguistic cues. By the evaluation on
GPT-4, we imitate the situation where all paralin-
guistic cues are recognised, and the performance
guarantees the quality of our samples.
Speaker Awareness. Under the same risk sub-
category, the content of risk speech and low-risk
speech are consistent. To investigate the changes of
results brought about by different speakers, we in-
troduce a metrics Speaker Awareness Rate (SAR),
which is used to measure the awareness of the cor-
responding paralinguistic cues,
SAR =TPrate −FPrate
Higher SAR means models can be effectively
aware of the change of speakers’ paralinguistic
cues, leading to the change of prediction results.
We present our results in Table 5. Qwen-Audio-
Chat and SALMONN-13B achieve the best per-
formance on sentiment and gender awareness, re-
spectively. And these 2 models also achieve the
second and the best performance on the subsequent
corresponding paralinguistic tasks in Table 3. How-
ever, WavLLM that outperforms other models on
age and ethnicity awareness fails on almost all risk
detecting and paralinguistic tasks. It can be effec-
tively aware of the change of speaker, but exhibitsa deficiency in alignment and bias. We speculate
an improved instruction-tuning may activate the
capability of WavLLM.
Paralinguistic Tasks. The premise of risk detec-
tion is to recognise the paralinguistic cues well,
therefore, we provide several paralinguistic tasks
to analyse models’ abilities.
•Sentiment Recognition (SR) We use speech
from sarcasm as test set, where the sentiment of
risk speech is labelled as "negative", and low-risk
speech is labelled as "neutral or positive". Qwen-
Audio-Chat and SALMONN-7B/13B achieve
similar performance on SR, consistent with re-
sults in sarcasm detection. Similarly, failure of
WavLLM and Gemini-1.5-Pro leads to a defi-
ciency on sarcasm detection.
•Speaker Counting (SC) We use conversational
speech as test set and label them as "Two", and
the speech that only contains the first speaker’s
utterances is labelled as "One". Gemini-1.5-Pro
and WavLLM outperform other models on SC,
however, WavLLM fails in the subsequent tasks
and Gemini-1.5-Pro even can not provide an an-
swer, which prevents them from being successful
in related risk detection.
•Gender, Age Group, and Accent Recognition
(GR, AGR, and AR) We label risk speech from
the corresponding risk type as "woman", "elderly
person" and "Indian accent"; for low-risk speech,
we label them as "man", "young person", and
"American accent". Qwen-Audio-Chat exhibits
the lack of alignment, but also demonstrates the
awareness of the change of speaker. SALMONN
7B/13B achieve the best performances on AGR
and GR, respectively, explaining the outstanding
capabilities in the corresponding risk detection
tasks. Accent recognition is a shortage among
models, however, they still show the risk aware-
ness in the risk detection evaluation.
6 Conclusion
We presented a speech-specific risk taxonomy
where paralinguistic cues in speech can transform
low-risk textual content into high-risk speech. We
created a high quality synthetic speech dataset un-
der human annotation and filtering. We observed
that even the most recent large multimodal mod-
els (such as Gemini 1.5 pro) perform near random
baseline, with some of the recent speechLLMs scor-
ing even worse than random guesses.7 Limitations
We expect to extend our evaluation experiments
to all risk types in our taxonomy, however, the
existing safeguards of TTS system prevents the
generation of such synthetic data. Our ongoing
plan to hire human speakers for collecting real data
is currently undergoing ethics committee review
atredacted for anonymity . Additionally, all
LMMs are evaluated on our synthetic dataset, and
human-generated speech could potentially intro-
duce other artefacts, making this task even more
challenging. We provided certain conjectures to
explain evaluation results and the capabilities of
LMMs, but this initial attempt requires further anal-
yse in separate works.
8 Ethics Statement
This research aims to open an avenue for system-
atically evaluating the capabilities of Large Mul-
timodal Models in detecting risk associated with
speech modality. The nature of this data is inher-
ently sensitive. To ensure our data (and its future
extensions) access facilitates progress towards safe-
guarding and does not contribute to harmful de-
signs, we will place the data access behind a request
form, demanding researchers to provide detailed
affiliation and intention of use, under a strict term
of use. Additionally, we have adhered to the us-
age policy of Audiobox and Google TTS, and did
not generate speech containing any explicit toxic
content .
