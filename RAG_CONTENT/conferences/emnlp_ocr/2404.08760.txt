Abstract
We explore the alignment of values in Large
Language Models (LLMs) with specific age
groups, leveraging data from the World Value
Survey across thirteen categories. Through a
diverse set of prompts tailored to ensure re-
sponse robustness, we find a general inclina-
tion of LLM values towards younger demo-
graphics, especially when compared to the US
population. Although a general inclination can
be observed, we also found that this inclination
toward younger groups can be different across
different value categories. Additionally, we
explore the impact of incorporating age iden-
tity information in prompts and observe chal-
lenges in mitigating value discrepancies with
different age cohorts. Our findings highlight
the age bias in LLMs and provide insights for
future work. Materials for our analysis are

1 Introduction
Widely used Large Language Models (LLMs)
should be reflective of all age groups (Dwivedi
et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2019; Hong et al., 2023).
Age statistics estimate that by 2030, 44.8% of the
US population will be over 45 years old (Vespa
et al., 2018), and one in six people worldwide will
be aged 60 years or over (World Health Organiza-
tion, 2022). Analyzing how the values (e.g., re-
ligious values) in LLMs align with different age
groups can enhance our understanding of the ex-
perience that users of different ages have with an
LLM. For instance, for an older group that may
exhibit less inclination towards new technologies
(Czaja et al., 2006; Colley and Comber, 2003), an
LLM that embodies the values of a tech-savvy in-
dividual may lead to less empathetic interactions.
Minimizing the value disparities between LLMs
and the older population has the potential to lead to
Figure 1: Age-related bias in LLMs on thirteen human
value categories. Human values in this figure refer in
particular to the US groups. Trend coefficients (see
calculation in Sec 3.3) were derived from the slope of
the changing gap between LLM and human values as
age increases. A positive trend coefficient signifies the
widening gap observed from younger to older groups,
thus indicating a model leaning towards younger age
groups. The significance test is detailed in Appx F.
better communication between these demograph-
ics and the digital products they engage with.
In this paper, we investigate whether andwhich
valuesinLLMs aremore aligned with specific age
groups. Specifically, by using the World Value
Survey (Haerpfer et al., 2020), we prompt various
LLMs to elicit their values on thirteen categories,
employing eight format variations in prompts for
robust testing. We observe a general inclination
of LLM values towards younger demographics, as
shown in Fig 1. We also demonstrate the spe-
cific categories of value and example inquiries
where LLMs exhibit such age preferences (See
Sec 4). Furthermore, we study theeffectofadding
ageidentity information when prompting LLMs.
Specifically, we instruct LLMs to use an age andarXiv:2404.08760v4  [cs.CL]  15 Oct 2024country identity before requesting their responses.
Surprisingly, we find that adding age identity fails
to eliminate the value discrepancies with targeted
age groups on eight out of thirteen categories (see
Fig 4), despite occasional success in specific in-
stances (See Sec 5). We advocate for increased
awareness within the research community regard-
ing the potential age bias inherent in LLMs, par-
ticularly concerning their predisposition towards
certain values. We also emphasize the complex-
ities involved in calibrating prompts to effectively
address this bias.
2 Related Work
Due to the rapid advancements in LLMs across
various tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al.,
2022), there is a growing concern regarding the
presence of social bias in these models (Kas-
neci et al., 2023). Recent research has shown
that LLMs exhibit “preferences” for certain de-
mographic groups, such as White and female in-
dividuals (Sun et al., 2023), and political incli-
nation (McGee, 2023; Atari et al., 2023). How-
ever, the age-related preferences of LLMs remain
less explored. Prior work has mentioned age as
one of multi-facets of bias in LLM performance
(Kamruzzaman et al., 2023; Haller et al., 2023;
Draxler et al., 2023; Levy et al., 2024; Oketunji
et al., 2023) while lacking a direct study on the age
aspect. Recent research (Duan et al., 2024) pub-
lishes an evaluation for well-known LLMs on age
bias through 50 multi-choice questions; unlike it
focuses on discriminatory narratives towards spe-
cific age groups, our investigation is running at an
implicit level. We argue that understanding the un-
derlying value systems is crucial, as the value dis-
crepancies between users and LLMs can signifi-
cantly impact their adoption of LLMs, even when
the explicit discrimination is rectified, as exempli-
fied in technology attitudes discussed in Sec 1.
3 Analytic Method
3.1 Human Data Acquisition
Dataset. We derive human values utilizing a
well-established survey dataset, the 7th wave of
the World Values Survey (WVS) (Haerpfer et al.,
2020). The survey systematically probes 94k indi-
viduals globally on 13 categories, covering a range
of social, political, economic, religious, and cul-
tural values. See more about WVS in Appx A.
Each inquiry is a single-choice question. Re-sponses are numeric, quantifying the inclination
on the options, e.g., “1:Strongly agree, 2:Agree,
3:Disagree, 4:Strongly disagree". Negative num-
ber is possible for coding exceptions such as “I
don’t know". To assess human values, we group
the respondents by age group1and country. Sub-
sequently, we compute the average values for each
age group and country to represent their respective
cohorts, ignoring the invalid negative numbers.
3.2 Prompting
Models. We conduct our analysis on six LLMs,
as introduced in Tab 1.

ChatGPT(GPT-3.5-turbo 0613)
InstructGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct)
Mistral (mistral-7B-v0.1)
Vicuna (vicuna-7b-v1.5)
FLAN-T5 (flan-t5-xxl)
FLAN-UL2 (flan-ul2)
Table 1: Model description.
 : commercial models,
: open models,
 : chat-based,
 : completion-based,
: RLHF, and
 : training with instructions.
Prompts. We identify three key components for
each inquiry in the survey: context ,question
ID&content , and options . To ensure robustness,
we made several format variations for the prompt2
(e.g., alter wordings and change order of com-
ponents), as previous research (Shu et al., 2023;
Röttger et al., 2024; Beck et al., 2023) uncovered
inconsistent performance in LLMs after receiving
a minor prompt variation. Eventually, we build a
set of eight distinct prompts per inquiry. Please see
prompt design details in Tab 8. Through a care-
ful analysis of the prompt responses (Appx B), we
observe the unstableness of LLM’s responses to
prompt variations. However, multiple prompt tri-
als assist with achieving a convergence point. On
95.5% of questions, more than half of the eight
prompts led to responses centered on the same
choice or adjacent options, and thus we believe it
is acceptable to consider the average of the out-
comes across the eight prompt variations as the
LLM’s final responses to WVS. In addition, due to
the instability of LLMs in following instructions,
we summarize seven types of unexpected replies
and present our coping methods for each in Tab 3.
118-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+
2Despite adopting format variations, we were cautious to
not include major changes as the content and structure of
WVS were carefully designed by sociologists and profession-
als.(a) model: ChatGPT; country: the US and China
 (b) model: Vicuna; country: Germany and Great Britain
Figure 2: Alignment rank of values of LLMs over different age groups in specific Countries. See results on
more models and countries in Appendix D and E . Rank 1 on a specific age group means that this age group has
the narrowest gap with LLM in values. An increasing monoticity indicates a closer alignment towards younger
groups.
In the process of averaging responses, we ignore
the invalid negative numbers, as we did in calcu-
lating human values. For reproducing our work,
prompting details are reported in Appx C.
3.3 Measures
We use vector Vcto represent values belonging to
a certain category c. Each question in the WVS
questionnaire is treated as a dimension:
Vc= [r1, r2, ...r nc],
where riis a numeric response to the ith ques-
tion in the section of c, and ncdenotes the total
question number. Note the acquisition of numeric
responses for human groups and LLM has been il-
lustrated in Sec 3.1 and 3.2.
By collecting 372 value vectors that represent
people across 62 countries and 6 age groups, along
with a value vector for the LLM to compare,
we perform min-max normalization, normal stan-
dardization, and then conduct principle compo-
nent analysis (PCA) (Tipping and Bishop, 1999)
on a total of 373 value vectors for representation
learning. We acquire value representations for all
groups with the dimensionality of three. Our con-
sideration of using PCA is in Appx G.1.
[xc, yc, zc] =PCA _transform ([r1, r2, ...r nc])
Letibe the index of age group in [18-24, 25-34,

tation for the ith age group be [xc,i, yc,i, zc,i]. We
derive three metrics below for our further analy-
ses:Euclidean Distance , the distance between two
value representations.

where (xc,M, yc,M, zc,M)represents values of
LLM on category c.Alignment Rank , the ascending rank of distances

Our reasons for these measure designs are de-
tailed in the Appx G.
4 Aligning with Which Age on Which
Values?
Trend Observation. Fig 2 exemplifies the bias
for LLMs across six age groups in several coun-
tries. Due to the limited paper pages, results
on other LLMs and countries can be found in
Appx D and E . As it is not intuitive to see a bias
towards younger people in these decoupled re-
sults, we summarize the performance of all LLMs
in the US, as shown in Fig 1. Then we observe a
general inclination of popular LLMs favoring the
values of younger demographics in the US on dif-
ferent value categories, indicated by the trend co-
efficient. Significance testing procedure is avail-
able in Appx F. We observe that in the US and
China, as countries with large populations, the
models tend to have a higher alignment rank on
younger groups on most categories, despite few
exceptions (e.g., happiness and well-being). How-
ever, in Ethiopia and Nigeria (Tab 15), the inclina-
tion is less evident. We leave this phenomenon for
future study.Case Study. In Fig 3, we show two representa-
tive prompts and their responses from ChatGPT
and human groups, to exemplify values where
ChatGPT displays a clear inclination toward a spe-
cific age group. Note LLM values can be far away
from all human age groups, as depicted in the sec-
ond sub-figure. We discuss this point in Appx G.2.
Figure 3: Two WVS prompts and their responses from
LLMs and humans (in purple).
5 The Effect of Adding Identity in
Prompts
Prompt Adjustment. To analyze if adding age
identity in the prompt helps to align values of
LLM with the targeted age groups, we adjust our
prompts by adding a sentence like “Suppose you
are from [ country ] and your age is between [ lower-
bound ] and [ upperbound ].” at the beginning of the
required component of the original prompt and get
responses that correspond with six age groups.
Observation on Gap Change. We illustrate the
change of Euclidean distance between values of
LLM and different age groups after adding iden-
tity information. As is presented in Fig 4, in eight
out of thirteen categories (No.1,2,4,5,7,8,11,12)
no improvement is observed.
Figure 4: Change of Euclidean distance after adding
identity information. The compared data is from values
of ChatGPT and humans from different age groups in
the US.Case Study. We also showcase a successful cal-
ibration example for a question about the source
of acquiring information in Fig 5. The value pyra-
mid illustrates LLMs’ responses for different age
ranges compared to the answers from the U.S.
population. When age is factored into the LLM
prompt, the LLM’s views are more aligned with
the U.S. population of that respective age group,
as it reports higher frequency using radio news for
the older group.

ChatGPT (right) for an inquiry on the frequency of us-
ing radio news.
6 Further Discussion on the Age Bias
Observed in LLMs
In this study, we have shown how LLMs are not
representative of the value systems of older adults.
Although further validation is necessary for a solid
conclusion, we believe there may be several poten-
tial harms arising from this bias:
• Older adults tend to place greater trust in
established organizations, particularly when it
comes to security concerns (as illustrated in Fig
1). An LLM unaware of these differences may
pose greater risks to older users, who may be
less prepared to identify misinformation from
what appears to be a credible source (e.g., LLM
itself). This could amplify the harm caused
by LLM-generated hallucinations when letting
LLMs serve aged people.
• LLMs may offer less empathetic interactions
to older adults by failing to account for their
traditional beliefs, leading to less respectful ex-
changes.
• For older adults, who are often less in-
clined towards new technologies, interacting
with LLMs embodying the values of tech-savvy
users could further alienate them. As shown inFig 3, many older adults still rely on the radio for
news, while younger people predominantly use
the internet.
7 Suggestions on Age-aware Alignment
for Future Work
Although we have shown that LLMs are not repre-
sentative of the value systems of older adults, our
study is not intended to promote a naive copy of
the values of different age groups to achieve align-
ment. Simplistically applying statistical knowl-
edge of the values of a particular age group might
reinforce stereotypes rather than promote genuine
alignment. For example, consider whether LLMs
should adopt the value that the older generation
is less tech-savvy and thus develop the stereotype
that an older user would primarily obtain news
from the radio rather than social media. However,
as illustrated in Fig 6, while fewer older adults
rely on social media for information, a signifi-
cant portion still does. Therefore, LLMs must be
aware of statistical discrepancies but should avoid
brute-force applying statistics to any individual,
as a brute-force application often only considers
the mean instead of other qualities, such as vari-
ance, outliers, and so on. Thus, to facilitate a true
age-aware alignment, we recommend researchers
to rely on the following rules of thumb:
• Avoid naively applying statistical knowledge
of the values of a particular age group, as this
can reinforce stereotypes instead of promot-
ing genuine alignment.
• Develop strategies that promote true
age-sensitive interactions, emphasizing
age-aware helpfulness and harmlessness,
grounded in an understanding of value
discrepancies across generations.
Achieving age-aware alignment requires LLMs
to be sensitive to value differences across age
groups and to build on these insights to offer help-
ful and harmless responses. For example, when
engaging with older users, instead of brute-force
assuming they are lagging behind new technol-
ogy, a well-aligned system should keep tracking
their understanding of the ongoing topics, offer-
ing more detailed explanations and minimizing
the use of neologisms only when confusion arises.
To achieve such age-sensitive interactions, explor-
ing an effective feedback-acquiring method dur-
ing interactions that complies with the real age-
Figure 6: People’s preference on obtaining information
from social media across different age groups in the US
population
tailored connotation of helpfulness and harmless-
ness is meaningful. Although challenging, we be-
lieve this is a vital direction for future research.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we investigated the alignment of val-
ues in LLMs with specific age groups using data
from the World Value Survey. Our findings sug-
gest a general inclination of LLM values towards
younger demographics. Our study contributes to
raising attention to the potential age bias in LLMs
and advocates continued efforts from the commu-
nity to address this issue. Moving forward, efforts
to calibrate value inclinations in LLMs should
consider the complexities involved in prompt en-
gineering and strive for equitable representation
across diverse age groups.
Limitations
There are several limitations in our paper. Firstly ,
Fig 3 may raise questions concerning the impor-
tance of any trends in light of LLM values not
resembling any age group of humans. We con-
jecture that due to the nature of Human Prefer-
ence Optimization (Rafailov et al., 2024; Ouyang
et al., 2022), LLMs develop extreme preferences
(e.g., manifest an extreme atheist). The resulting
LLMs will thus be unlike the subtler preferences
of humans. Our study does not focus on the ab-
solute difference between LLMs and humans, but
instead emphasizes the inclination, as we have ex-
plained in Appendix G.2. However, future work is
needed to reflect on the current process of Human
Preference Optimization, especially on whether it
will be problematic or acceptable if we over-alignLLMs with human preference. Secondly , due to
time and cost considerations, we were not able to
try more sophisticated prompts for age alignment,
which may effectively eliminate the value dispar-
ity with targeted age groups. Finally , our analy-
sis relies on the questionnaire of WVS. However,
their question design is not perfectly tailored for
characterizing age discrepancies, which limits the
depth of sight we could get from analysis.
Ethics Statement

A World Value Survey
The WVS3survey is conducted every five years,
which systematically probes individuals globally
on social, political, economic, religious, and cul-
tural values. We share a page of WVS question-
naire in Tab 7. See the statistics of inquiries in
Fig 2. Demographic statistics of WVS are acces-
sible via Document-Online analysis. Note that we
removed ten of them that require demographic in-
formation, as these are impossible to apply to an
LLM lacking demographic data, and kept 249 in-
quiries as our final choices for prompting.
B The Instability of LLM Outputs Due
to Prompt Variations
Regarding the unstableness of LLM outputs due
to prompting variation, we observed LLM’s insta-
bility to prompt variations. However, instead of
testing more prompts, we ended up using the de-
signed eight variations to support our study. Our
decision was made by conducting a deep analysis

of using our current prompts. The key findings are
listed below:
(1)56.3% of survey questions exhibited incon-
sistent answers induced by eight different
prompts.
(2) In 68.1% of survey questions, six or more
prompts resulted in the majority answer.
(3) In 80.3% of survey questions, four or more
prompts induce the majority answer.
(4) For 45 questions, fewer than four prompts
led to the majority answer, indicating di-
verse choices and reflecting LLMs’ self-
conflict on these questions. These questions
are on economic equity/liberty, sex conser-
vation/freedom, whether acknowledging the
importance of developing economics, per-
ception about the living environment, etc.
(5)Despite potential variations in answers in-
duced by prompt variation, we found for95.5% of inquiries, more than half of the
responses are centered on the same choice
or its adjacent options. The adjacent option
is a score equal to the majority score +/- 1.
Eventually, while discovering the unstableness
of LLM outputs, we believe it is reasonable to use
the average score from eight prompts as a repre-
sentative value.
C Prompting Details
Our prompting process can be described as three
steps below:
1. Repeatedly request LLMs’ responses on sur-
vey questions with 8 different prompts. For
each question, there will be 8 numerical
scores induced by prompts,where only the
missing code is a negative number.
2. Calculate the mean of scores for each ques-
tion while ignoring negative scores. Then weUnexpected Reply

questions for each value category. The vec-
tor represents the LLM’s value in a specific
category.
3. Preprocess the value vector for data analysis,
as illustrated in Sec 3.1.
The cost of API calling from Closed-coursed
LLMs is less than 5 dollars. For the deployment
of open-sourced models, we ran either model on
a single A40 GPU with float16 precision. When
prompting, we prompt models with a temperature
1.0, max token length 1024, and random seed 42.
D Results on Other LLMs
In the section, we supplement the alignment rank-
ing results on InstructGPT (Fig 9), FLAN-T5-
XXL (Fig 10) and FLAN-UL2 (Fig 11), Mistral
(Fig 12) and Vicuna (Fig 13) respectively.
E Results on Other Countries
We have extended our analysis to include align-
ment results from an additional four pairs of coun-
tries: Argentina and Brazil (Tab 14), Ethiopia and
Nigeria (Tab 15), Germany and Great Britain (Tab
16), and Indonesia and Malaysia (Tab 17).F Significance Test
In this section, we conduct two kinds of signif-
icance tests to support our study: (1) we use
MANOV A to test the significant difference among
human values from different age groups, and (2)
we use t-distribution to test the significant ten-
dency of LLMs towards younger groups. Notes
our focus lies in characterizing the inclination of
LLM values toward specific age groups. That is
to say, we are claiming a significant tendency over
age, rather than claiming LLMs significantly re-
semble any specific age group. We make a deeper
discussion about our declaration in the section on
Limitations.
F.1 Significance Test for the Discrepancy
among Human Age Groups
Our analysis should be based on a reasonable pre-
condition that in WVS, human values are signif-
icantly diverse across different age groups. We
used MANOV A (multivariate analysis of variance)
to test the significant difference in human values
across all age groups, as shown below:
Null hypothesis ( H0): the age group has no effect
on any responses to the survey questions
Statistics: Wilks’ lambda
Result: See Tab 4. In conclusion: We reject the
null hypothesis with p-value < 1e-4Country Value Num DF Den DF F Value Pr > F (p-value)

F.2 Significance Test for Trend Coefficient
As it may be hard to interpret the trend coef-
ficient in Fig 1 on some categories (e.g., per-
ception of corruption). Despite its bias towards
younger/older, it may not be a significantly mean-
ingful number. We add significance testing for the
linear regression on trend coefficient.
Null hypothesis ( H0):α= 0, where is the trend
coefficient fitted by a linear regression model pre-
sented in Sec 3.3.

G Our Consideration on Measure Design
G.1 Reasons for Applying PCA
We choose PCA for the following reasons:
1. Each question in WVS ought not to be
equally important. Furthermore, for the ques-
tions belonging to a certain category, they
correlate with each other. To this end, we
need to find out the principal components
among multiple inquiries.
2. PCA here is also used as an unsupervised
representation learning method. Compared
to utilizing original data, the representations
learned from hundreds of comparable exam-
ples (372 value vectors from different coun-
tries and age groups) will mitigate the curse
of dimensionality and other undesired prop-
erties of high-dimensional spaces. Other rep-
resentation learning methods are also appli-
cable. As the medium number of original di-
mensionality for all categories is 11, PCA is
enough to handle the learning problem.
Furthermore, we set the target number of PCA
components to three. We empirically set so, con-
sidering the medium number of original dimen-
sionality for all categories is eleven. Then we val-
idate this parameter by calculating the percentageof variance explained by each of the selected com-
ponents. If all components are stored, the sum of
the ratios is equal to 1.0. The explained variance
ratio of keeping three dimensions is an average of
no less than 0.72 in all categories of six models,
which we believe is acceptable.
G.2 Consideration of Using the Rank of
Difference as Measurement
In Sec 3.3, we utilize the rank of difference to
characterize the value discrepancies and the trend
coefficient over age. Presenting rank is simple and
convenient for data visualization. However, using
the rank of difference may ignore the magnitude
(the absolute value) of difference that is (1) among
the different age groups of humans or (2) between
LLM values and specific age groups of humans.
We further clarify that:
(1) Appx F.1 has shown significant value dis-
crepancies among different age groups of humans
in the countries we experiment on. So, using the
rank of difference would not exaggerate a signif-
icant disparity between human age groups to ob-
serve, as the discrepancies have existed signifi-
cantly.
(2) As shown in the second sub-figure of Fig
3, it is possible that LLMs values are far away
from all human age groups. Such discrepancies
also would not reflect on the rank of difference.
However, our study focus lies in characterizing
the inclination of LLM values towards specific
age groups. That is to say, we are claiming a
significant tendency over age, rather than claim-
ing LLMs significantly resemble any specific age
group. We make a deeper discussion about our
declaration in the section of Limitations.Category ChatGPT InstructGPT Mistral Vicuna Flan-t5 Flan-ul
