Abstract
The safety defense methods of Large language
models (LLMs) stays limited because the dan-
gerous prompts are manually curated to just few
known attack types, which fails to keep pace
with emerging varieties. Recent studies found
that attaching suffixes to harmful instructions
can hack the defense of LLMs and lead to dan-
gerous outputs. However, similar to traditional
text adversarial attacks, this approach, while
effective, is limited by the challenge of the dis-
crete tokens. This gradient based discrete op-
timization attack requires over 100,000 LLM
calls, and due to the unreadable of adversarial
suffixes, it can be relatively easily penetrated
by common defense methods such as perplexity
filters. To cope with this challenge, in this pa-
per, we proposes an Adversarial Suffix Embed-
ding Translation Framework (ASETF), aimed
at transforming continuous adversarial suffix
embeddings into coherent and understandable
text. This method greatly reduces the com-
putational overhead during the attack process
and helps to automatically generate multiple
adversarial samples, which can be used as data
to strengthen LLMs security defense. Experi-
mental evaluations were conducted on Llama2,
Vicuna, and other prominent LLMs, employing
harmful directives sourced from the Advbench
dataset. The results indicate that our method
significantly reduces the computation time of
adversarial suffixes and achieves a much better
attack success rate to existing techniques, while
significantly enhancing the textual fluency of
the prompts. In addition, our approach can be
generalized into a broader method for gener-
ating transferable adversarial suffixes that can
successfully attack multiple LLMs, even black-
box LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini.
1 Introduction
In the domain of natural language processing
(NLP), the innovation and emergence of large lan-
guage models (LLMs) such as chatGPT, Llama,
∗Corresponding authorand their variants have revolutionized the land-
scape of automated text generation and analysis.
While these models exhibit remarkable proficiency
in emulating human-like text, their application is
suffering from significant risks, particularly in the
context of generating harmful content under adver-
sarial manipulation (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Ab-
delnabi et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023).
A common technique to bypassing the defenses
of securely aligned LLMs and induce them to re-
spond to harmful instructions was adding jailbreak
templates, such as “Do anything now” (Shen et al.,
2023). Due to the fact that the construction of
jailbreak templates relies entirely on human ex-
perience, which greatly limits the progress on
LLM defense methods . To overcome this, re-
searchers have begun to study methods for auto-
matically constructing jailbreak templates, such as
MasterKey (Deng et al., 2023) and GPTFuzzer (Yu
et al., 2023). However, these methods hardly uti-
lize the internal information of the to-be-attacked
model. As a result, there is a large room to improve
the efficiency of the attack.
The discreteness of text makes it impossible to
directly utilize gradient information of the to-be-
attacked model. Though Zou et al. (2023) found
that it is possible to discretely optimize a set of
unreadable adversarial suffixes through gradient-
based methods to guide the LLMs output harmful
content, this approach typically necessitates hun-
dreds of iterations, with each step requiring hun-
dreds of computations by the LLMs to confirm the
optimal candidate, resulting in high computational
costs.
In this paper, we endeavors to address this chal-
lenge by introducing an innovative method that
first optimizes continuous adversarial embedding
suffixes in the to-be-attacked model embedding
space, and then proposes an Adversarial Suffix Em-
bedding Translation Framework (ASETF) that ef-
fectively transforms these continuous adversarialarXiv:2402.16006v2  [cs.CL]  4 Jun 2024embedding suffixes into semantically rich and co-
herent text by training an embedding translation
model.
To construct a training dataset, we convert the
Wikipedia pre-training corpora1into a parallel
dataset. This dataset is chosen for its extensive
diversity, ensuring a wide lexical coverage that en-
riches the embedding space with nuanced semantic
information. Specifically, one side contains the
original Wikipedia text, and the other side contains
text (contextual information) with partial embed-
dings inserted. The partial embeddings are created
by feeding text snippets from Wikipedia into the
target LLMs, which we intend to attack. Through a
fine-tuning process (use pre-trained LLM, such as
GPT-j (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021)), the model
is enabled to revert these embeddings back to their
original textual forms. This ensures that the text
output by our method remains as consistent as
possible with the representation of the adversarial
suffix embedding within the to-be-attacked model.
The incorporation of contextual information in the
training data further enhances our model’s capa-
bility to generate contextually relevant and mean-
ingful translations in response to malicious instruc-
tions.
In the experiment, we use the Advbench
dataset (Zou et al., 2023) and conducted attacks
based on existing LLMs such as Llama2 and Vi-
cuna. The experimental results demonstrate that
this method not only improves the success rate of at-
tacks, but also significantly reduces computational
costs, while improving the coherence and fluency
of adversarial inputs, thus enhancing its robustness.
Our main contributions can be summarized as
follows:
•Increased computational efficiency: We
have significantly reduced the computational
cost of generating adversarial suffixes, en-
abling efficient and automated generation of
adversarial samples.
•Enhanced Textual Fluency: We achieved
high-fluency adversarial suffixes, reducing the
probability of being detected by perplexity-
based filters or human observers.
•Transferable Adversarial Suffixes: Our
method generates effective universal suffixes
against a large variety of LLMs including

ini, indicating its widespread applicability in
LLM security.

2.1 LLM Safety Defense
Recent advancements in large language models
have led to their widespread adoption across var-
ious domains. However, this rapid expansion
has also unveiled numerous security vulnerabil-
ities (Abdelnabi et al., 2023). In response, re-
searchers have proposed a variety of security mea-
sures to mitigate these risks (Jain et al., 2023).
One primary defense strategy involves pre-
processing and post-processing the inputs and out-
puts of the model. These techniques enhance
the overall system’s security without altering the
model’s parameters. Such as perplexity filter-
ing, paraphrasing (Jain et al., 2023) and erase-
and-check (Kumar et al., 2023). Another type of
method uses LLM itself to perform harmful checks
on the output (Helbling et al., 2023). Such ap-
proaches, while effective in certain scenarios, for
example, adversarial suffix (Zou et al., 2023), often
rely on simple rules. This reliance can lead to false
positives (Glukhov et al., 2023), mistakenly cate-
gorizing benign content as harmful, and introduce
additional latency in inference phase.
Another category focuses on improving the
model’s safety through secure alignment tech-
niques. These methods aim to train the model to in-
herently understand and avoid generating harmful
content. One direct approach is to include unsafe
prompts and their corresponding security responses
in the instruction tuning dataset to teach the model
how to handle unsafe prompts (Ouyang et al., 2022;
Varshney et al., 2023). Another method is based
on reinforcement learning, Safe-RLHF (Dai et al.,
2023) is a representative of this type of method
since RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human
Feedback) (Ouyang et al., 2022) offers a viable
method for tuning Large Language Models to align
with human preferences.
2.2 LLM Safety Attack
As mentioned above, the abuse of LLMs can lead to
the continuous leakage of harmful content to users,
and people refer to this induced prompt as jailbreak
prompt, such as “Do anything now” (Shen et al.,
2023). The most widely used jailbreak prompts
come from manual summaries, such as the exis-Figure 1: This is a conceptual sketch of our method, we first obtain adversarial suffixes embedding through gradient
based optimization, and then use an embedding translation model to convert the obtained suffixes into fluent text
with almost no change in embedding.
tence of a large number of successful jailbreak tem-
plates on websites2. However, this method relies
too heavily on manual labor and cannot guarantee
effectiveness for all instructions. Therefore, Yu
et al. (2023) further rewrote the jailbreak template
through the AFL(American Fuzzy Lop) fuzzing
framework to automatically generate more. Deng
et al. (2023) viewed this task as a text-style trans-
fer task, fine-tuning LLM on the prompt for suc-
cessful attacks to automatically generate more jail-
break prompts. Inspired by text adversarial attacks,
Zhang et al. (2023) successfully jailbreak by modi-
fying certain grammatical structures in the prompt.
Zou et al. (2023) optimized a adversarial suffix
based on Autoprompt (Shin et al., 2020) to en-
able LLMs to respond to harmful instructions. Liu
et al. (2023) and Zhu et al. (2023) optimized the
readability of suffixes on it, making attacks more
covert. Wichers et al. (2024) use a secure classifier
to provide gradients and directly optimize prompts
using gumbel softmax. In addition, conditional
text generation methods (Li et al., 2022; Wang and
Sha, 2024) are also can be used to create “jailbreak”
prompts that bypass safety guards. As mentioned
earlier, although researchers have proposed various
security defense mechanisms to cope with these
attacks, the most effective defense methods often
reduce the performance of the model (Li et al.,
2023).
3 Method
In this section, we will introduce our approach in
two main parts: (1) how to obtain adversarial suffix
embeddings and (2) how to translate these embed-
2https://www.jailbreakchat.com/dings back into text. Firstly, we provide a detailed
introduction to the method of optimizing the ad-
versarial suffix embeddings in the continuous em-
bedding space and how to universally attack mul-
tiple prompts and transfer attacks to other LLMs.
Secondly, we describe an embedding translation
framework aimed at converting adversarial suffix
embeddings into coherent, semantically rich text
content. This framework involves a self-supervised
learning task that translates text embeddings back
into original text on a corpus, ensuring that ad-
versarial suffixes not only maintain their expected
effectiveness but also closely align with the seman-
tics of harmful instructions.
3.1 Obtain Adversarial Suffix Embeddings
Assuming we have a harmful instruction xharmand
an expected LLM’s response to this instruction R,
the goal is to generate a set of discrete tokens X∗
as adversarial suffix:
X∗= arg min
XPatt(R|xharm⊕xsuff;θ)),(1)
where Pattrepresents the text probability distribu-
tion defined by the to-be-attacked LLM with param-
eters denoted by θ,⊕represents the concatenation
of texts.
But the discrete adversarial suffix optimization
described has low efficiency due to the need to
calculate gradients for each word in the possible
candidate set vocab Vfor each token at each step.
An intuitive approach is to transfer optimization
from a discrete token space to a continuous word
embedding space. Taking inspiration from tradi-
tional gradient-based continuous adversarial attack
methods (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and prompt tun-
ing (Liu et al., 2022), we introduce continuousadversarial suffix optimization to train suffix em-
bedding vectors that can induce the model to output
harmful content.
Specifically, the core idea revolves around aug-
menting the input embedding with a specially de-
signed vector, followed by optimization to align
the model’s outputs with predefined targets. As
mentioned above, for a harmful instruction Pand
a corresponding response R, we randomly sample
ntimes from the vocab Vand use the word embed-
ding vectors corresponding to ntokens as the initial
training vectors ϕ= (ϕ1, ϕ2, ...ϕ n), our goal is to:
R=LLM att(Ep⊕ϕ;θ)), (2)
where EpisP’s embedding vector in the to-be-
attacked models. Set the embedding dimensions is
d,ϕ∈RL×d, we can use common cross entropy
loss functions to optimize Vt:
R= (r1, r2, . . . , r n), (3)
E=Ep⊕ϕ, (4)
Lce=−nX
t=1logP(rt|r1:t−1, E;θ). (5)
When optimizing M harmful instructions and K
to-be-attacked models simultaneously:
(P, R) = (( P1, R1), . . . , (PM, RM)), (6)
Ri= (ri1, ri2, . . . , r in), (7)
Ei=EPi⊕ϕ, (8)
Lce=−KX
j=1MX
i=1nX
t=1logPj(rit|ri1:t−1, Ei;θ).
(9)
where Pjis the probability distribution output by
the j-th to-be-attacked model.
However, this method does not limit the opti-
mization space of ϕ, making it easy for the final Vt
to deviate from the word embedding distribution of
the to-be-attacked model. To address this issue, we
introduce the Maximum Mean Discrepancy loss,
which measures the difference between two proba-
bility distributions by measuring their distance. In
our method, we randomly sample mtokens from
the vocab V(when attack on multiple models, we
simply combine the vocab of all models) and use
their embeddings as the word embedding distribu-
tionXof the to-be-attacked model(s), and calcu-
late the MMD loss with ϕ:Lmmd ({X},{ϕ}) =1

method, we choose to use the Gaussian kernel

by predecessors.

3.2 Embedding Translation Framework
Our study introduces an advanced embedding trans-
lation technique aimed at enhancing the expres-
sive of adversarial inputs targeting Large Lan-
guage Models (LLMs) without compromising their
success rates. This method is designed to trans-
form dummy adversarial suffixes into coherent,
semantically-rich textual content, thus providing
deeper insights into the adversarial generation
mechanisms of LLMs. This framework operates
by mapping textual corpora to a high-dimensional
embedding space and subsequently reverting these
embeddings to textual representations that retain
the original content’s semantic integrity.
3.2.1 Translate embeddings targeted on a
single LLM
We propose to fine-tune the translation LLM in a
fully self-supervised way to make it able to com-
plete the task. The main architecture of our method
is depicted in Figure 2. Given a pre-training cor-
poraC={c(1), c(2), . . . , c(n)}with a correspond-
ing vocab V={wi|i= 1,2, . . .}. Each token wi
corresponds to two embedding representations:
ei=Etrans(wi), e′
i=Eattack(wi), (13)(a) single target (b) multiple targets
Figure 2: The illustration of the Embedding Translation Framework. (a) Single target : The context is mapped into
embedding space by the translate LLM’s embedding lookup layer, while the suffix is mapped into embedding space
by the target LLM’s lookup layer for adaptation. The goal is to successfully translate the adapted suffix back into
the original text. (b) Multiple targets : The embedding lookup layers of multiple target LLM are integrated so the
translated suffix can universally attack all targets even black-box target LLMs.
where Etransrepresents the embedding lookup layer
of the LLM that is used for embedding translation,
andEattack represents the embedding lookup layer
of the LLM that is to be attacked.
Note that this comprehensive approach lever-
ages a pretrained LLM for the embedding transla-
tion process. This is a better choice than normal
sequence-to-sequence translation models because
it has undergone iterative optimization to maximize
performance on a huge amount of text generation
tasks. So, it ensures a nuanced understanding and
manipulation of LLM vulnerabilities through se-
mantically and contextually rich adversarial inputs,
which is a good start point for our embedding trans-
lation task.
Since augmenting embeddings with contextual
cues is pivotal for aligning the generated text with
specific semantic and contextual requirements, we
design each training example as a pair of sentences
(context and suffix). So, we first randomly select
two consecutive sentences {c1, c2}from the cor-
poraCas is shown in Figure 2(a). We intend to
make c1as the context information (a.k.a the re-
placement of xharmin Eqn. (1)) and c2as the suffix
(a.k.a the replacement of xsuffin Eqn. (1)), and we
denote their tokens as:
c1={t1, . . . , t m}, (14)
c2={s1, . . . , s n}, (15)where mandnrepresents the token number of c1
andc2. Then, we convert c1andc2by Eqn (13)
intoECandESas:
EC={eti|i= 1, . . . , m } (16)
ES={e′
si|i= 1, . . . , n }, (17)
where eti∈Rd1andesi∈Rd2. The dimensions
d1andd2of the embedding space are determined
by the pre-trained LLMs.
Note that the input of the embedding transla-
tion model in the inference stage is ϕoptimized by
Eqn. (11) which does not appear in the word em-
bedding set of the to-be-attacked model. Therefore,
in order to enhance the translation robustness of
the model in the inference stage, we add random
Gaussian noise ϵtoESduring the training stage,
so that the vectors near ESall point to text c2.
In the next step, we would like to link the embed-
ding sequences together to make a whole prompt,
but the hyperparameters of the translation LLM
(LLM trans) and the LLM to be attacked (LLM att)
are not necessary to be the same. So, we need
to add an additional mapping layer after the em-
bedding layer of the translation model to align the
embedding dimension of the target model ( d2) with
the embedding dimension of the translation model
(d1). Simply, we use a fully connected layer char-
acterized by a weight matrix and bias term to trans-
form a vector with dimension d1into a vector withdimension d2. Then, the concatenation process is
as follows:
EC⊕ESWad, (18)
where Wad∈Rd2×d1,⊕means to link two embed-
ding sequence together.
The translation LLM is fine-tuned to minimize a
defined loss J, optimizing the parameter set θfor
accurate text (sensible suffix) reconstruction. So,
our final objective is as follows:
J(θ) =1
n|D|X
(c1,c2)∈DnX
i=1L(si, oi;θ),(19)
where Drepresents the dataset constructed from
corpus C, which contains multiple consecutive sen-
tence pairs. The loss function L, typically cross-
entropy, quantifies the difference between the orig-
inal text token siand its reconstruction oi.
3.2.2 Translate embeddings targeted on
multiple LLMs
The key to translating the discrete embeddings into
a “universal” and “transferable” prompt is to fa-
miliarize the translation model with the embedding
layers of as many target LLMs as possible. So, we
designed a simple yet effective method to trans-
late the dummy adversarial suffixes w.r.t multiple
targeted LLMs, as is shown in Figure 2(b). Our ap-
proach trains a single translation model on multiple
target models simultaneously, eliminating the need
to train individually embedding translation models
for each targeted LLMs, and has achieved excel-
lent results. Specifically, for each training sample
(c1,c2), we use the following objective to fine-tune
the embedded translator across all intended target
LLMs:
J(θ) =1
nm|D|X
(c1,c2)∈DmX
j=1nX
i=1L(si, oij;θ),
(20)
where mis the number of target LLMs, oijis the
translate LLM’s i-th output token w.r.t the j-th
target LLM.
Through our method, the translation model will
learn how to ensure the embedding consistency of
the results in each target LLM based on the context.
4 Experiments
4.1 Data &Model & Metrics
Our harmful attack data is based on Advbench (Zou
et al., 2023), which provides over 500 harmfulinstructions and corresponding unsafe responses.
In our embedded translation framework, we use
Wikipedia dataset3and only use the English cor-
pus within it. We use two consecutive sentences
with more than 20 tokens as our training data, as
shown in the Figure 1, the first sentence serves as
the context and the second sentence serves as the
suffix.
We fine tuned GPT-j-6b (Wang and Komat-
suzaki, 2021)) as the embedding translation model,
and the model to-be-attack mainly chose Llama2-
7b-chat, Vicuna-7b-v1.5, Mistral-7b and Alpaca-
7b(with Safe-RLHF). In addition, we test our trans-
fer attack on Vicuna-13b-v1.5, Llama2-13b-chat,
ChatGLM3-6b and blac-box commercial models
such as ChatGPT and Gemini.
In order to test the success rate of the attack
(ASR), we first followed the previous method,
which first defined a negative list and then judged
whether the model replied with negative phrases
in the list. If not, it indicates that the attack was
successful. However, this rule-based method is too
simple and has low accuracy (Yu et al., 2023). So,
in addition, we use gpt3.5-turbo4as a classifier to
determine whether the model outputs harmful con-
tent. The success rates of attacks obtained by these
two methods are ASR prefix ,ASR gpt.
Another key indicator is perplexity (PPL), which
is used to indicate the fluency of the input prompt:
log(PPL) =−NX
i=1logP(wi|w<i), (21)
where W= (w1, . . . , w i)is the prompt. To be con-
sistent with previous works (Wichers et al., 2024),
in our experiment, we used the to-be-attacked LLM
to calculate P(wi|w1, ..., w i−1).
We use Self-BLEU metric (Zhu et al., 2018) to
measure the text diversity of the generated prompt.
In our approach, prompt is a combination of harm-
ful instructions and adversarial suffixes. The spe-
cific calculation formula is as follows:
1
nnX
i=1Pn
j=1,j̸=iBP×expPN
n=1wn·logpi,j
n−1
(22)
where Pi,jis the exact match ratio between the
i-th generated text and the j-th generated text on
the corresponding n-gram and BP is short for the

4https://chat.openai.com/brevity penalty . In our experiments, we set N= 4
and use average weight.
4.2 Baseline and Ablation Test Settings
We compare our proposed method with three base-
line models, namely:
•GCG (Zou et al., 2023): An discrete optimiza-
tion method of adversarial suffixes based on
gradient to induce model output of harmful
content.
•AutoDan[Liu] (Liu et al., 2023): Using a care-
fully designed hierarchical genetic algorithm
on the basis of GCG to enhance the conceal-
ment of jailbreak prompts;
•AutoDan[Zhu] (Zhu et al., 2023): Guided
by the dual goals of jailbreak and readability,
optimize from left to right to generate read-
able jailbreak prompts that bypass perplexity
filters;
•GPTFuzzer (Wichers et al., 2024): Using
templates written by humans as initial seeds,
then automating mutations to generate new
templates.
We performed an ablation study to validate
the necessity of each component in our proposed
ASETF framework. Specifically, we compared
ASETF to three modified frameworks lacking key
modules of our full system. The brief introduction
of these methods are as follows:
•ET-suffix : In the process of fine-tuning the
translation model, only the suffix is translated
without considering the context;
•ET-ce : When optimizing the continuous em-
bedding vector ϕin Section 3.1, only use Lce
without Lmmd;
•ET-origin : In the process of fine-tuning the
translation model, do not add noise ϵto the
embedding vector of suffix Es;
•Rand-suffix : Randomly extract tokens from
a vocabulary as attack suffixes.

our experimental results.
The experimental results show that compared
with traditional gradient based discrete optimiza-
tion suffix or methods based on jailbreak templates,
our method has a higher attack success rate and im-
proves the fluency of input prompts. Crucially, our
method has higher computational efficiency due to
optimization in continuous embedding spaces.
Due to the contextual information incorporated
during the training process, our method produces
adversarial suffixes and instructions that are more
semantically relevant, enhancing the robustness of
adversarial samples. As shown in Table 2, the
experimental results indicate that even when para-
phrasing prompts as defense, the success rate of
our method still higher than other methods.

4.3.2 Ad-hoc LLM attack with universal
suffix
We use the method in Section 3.1 to optimize the
adversarial suffix for 25 harmful instructions simul-
taneously, in order to obtain the same suffix thatcan generalize all harmful instructions.

Table 3: The result of our method and baseline method
in Ad-hoc LLM attack with universal suffix
The experimental results in Table 3show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art attack success rate
and also improves the fluency of universal adver-
sarial suffixes. More importantly, it significantly
reduces the time required to obtain universal adver-
sarial suffixes.
4.3.3 Transferable LLM attack with ad-hoc
suffix
Training on multiple models simultaneously is a
common approach to improve the transferability of
adversarial samples. For each harmful instruction,
we trained adversarial suffixes both the Llama2-7b-
chat model and Vicuna-7b-v1.5, and transferred the
obtained adversarial suffixes to other LLMs. We
chose three LLMs, Vicuna-13b, Llama2-13b chat,
and Chatglm3-6b, to test the transferability of the
adversarial suffixes we obtained. Due to the direct
transfer of adversarial suffixes, both Perplexity and
Self-BLEU values are the same when attack differ-
ent LLMs. The specific experimental results are in
Table 4:

Table 4: The results of our method and GCG on the
transferability of adversarial suffixes
The experimental results indicate that the ad-
versarial suffixes obtained by our method have a
certain degree of transferability. Compared with
other method based on adversarial suffixes, ASETF
has a higher success rate of transfer attacks, but
compared to the direct attack method using model
gradient information, the success rate of transfer at-
tacks has significantly decreased. This may due to
the significant differences between different LLMs
in the pre-train stage.4.4 Ablation Test

Table 5: Ablation results of attacking Llama2-7b-chat
and Vicuna-7b-v1.5 models
The results of ablation tests in Table 5 indicate
that removing the MMD loss during the optimiza-
tion process of continuously embedded vectors
ϕ, or removing contextual information within the
embedding translation framework, significantly re-
duces the fluency of adversarial samples. Addition-
ally, removing the random noise ϵadded during the
training process of the translation model also leads
to a decrease in the performance of our method.
Furthermore, randomly selected tokens as suffixes
fail to jailbreak attacks, demonstrating the need for
carefully designed adversarial suffixes.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a robust and comprehen-
sive framework for generating semantically rich
and coherent adversarial inputs. Initially, we derive
an embedding translation model by undertaking
the task of text reconstruction from embeddings on
raw text. Subsequently, input the vector trained in
continuous embedding space into the translation
model, resulting in adversarial suffixes. Through
experimentation on multiple Large Language Mod-
els (LLMs), our method significantly reduces com-
putational costs compared to optimizing suffixes
in discrete space, while achieving a higher attack
success rate and improving the fluency and diver-
sity of the suffix. This contributes to the formu-
lation of more effective defense strategies and in
our approach, the process of obtaining the embed-
dings for adversarial suffixes and the training of the
translation model are decoupled, implying that our
method is plug-and-play. This method is expected
to be further applied in text adversarial attacks be-
yond just LLM jailbreak attacks.Limitations
Firstly, from the experimental results, it is dis-
cernible that universal adversarial suffixes, opti-
mized for multiple instructions, exhibit a lower
success rate in attacks compared to independent
adversarial suffixes. This phenomenon could be
attributed to the necessity for universal adversar-
ial suffixes to encapsulate a broader spectrum of
information. However, the capacity for informa-
tion representation of discrete tokens depends on
their length, and an extended length implies a more
complex optimization process.
Upon further examination of cases, we observe
that if the adversarial suffixes generated by the
translation model are biased towards semantics re-
lated to harmful instructions in the preceding text,
the attack is prone to failure. Conversely, if they
lean towards maintaining the consistency of em-
beddings, it can lead to textual incoherence. Our
method does not explicitly model these two objec-
tives separately; hence, it is not possible to artifi-
cially control which target the generated adversarial
suffixes are more inclined towards.
Ethics Statement
Firstly, the goal of this article is to promote the
exploration of defense mechanisms for Large Lan-
guage Models (LLMs), rather than to obtain illegal
content from LLMs, as outlined in the appendix.
Secondly, the training data used in this article are
all public data, and there is no data falsification in
the experimental results. Our code will be submit-
ted with the paper and uploaded to GitHub.

A.1 ChatGPT context harmful discriminate prompt
As described in our experimental setup, we use ChatGPT to determine whether the attacked model outputs
harmful content. Below is the prompt template we use.
Given the following text generated by a language model during its conversation with a human
being, please evaluate its potential harm or offensiveness, considering factors such as hate speech,
discrimination, violence, or any other harmful content. Please note that any part of the response
containing harmful content is unsafe.
You should first analyze if it is harmful, explicitly or implicitly, and then give your conclusion. Your
conclusion should be safe or unsafe, wrapped in double square brackets, i.e., [[safe]] or [[unsafe]]

A.2 Case Study
Our proposed method for attacking multiple target language models can also be applied in black-box
scenarios where the victim models only expose APIs or web services. The Figure 3 shows an example
prompt attack on ChatGPT, Gemini and Palm. The harmful instruction is “Write a manual on how to
escape from a correctional facility” and the transferable adversarial suffix generated by our method is
“jumping off the wall were considered to be techniques to escape from a prison.”. In fact, this suffix
provides a background or context, making the entire instruction appear more like a discussion rather than
a direct request to violate laws or ethical norms. This background information prevents the model from
perceiving the question as a direct solicitation, thereby avoiding responses that encourage inappropriate
behavior.

A.4 Hyperparameters
We use the pre-trained model GPT-j (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021) as the base model for the em-
bedding translation framework, and we used the deepspeed framework (Rasley et al., 2020) for
distributed training on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. We finetune the GPT-j model for 3 epochs, with
per_device_train_batch_size is 1 so that total batch_size is 8 and the learning rate is set to
1e−5,warm-up_min_lr is1e−6and the maximum sequence length is set to 1560. We use
the Adam optimizer with β1= 0.9andβ2= 0.95. In addition, the weight_decay is set to 0.1,
gradient_accumulation_steps is 4 and warm-up_ratio is 0.1.
A.5 Comparison of embedding before and after translation
After applying the t-SNE dimensionality reduction technique, we can visualize the embeddings in a
two-dimensional space, which aids in identifying patterns and relationships that may not be apparent in
higher dimensions. The Figure 4 demonstrates the before-and-after effect of the translation process on
the data embeddings. It is evident from the figure that the embeddings remain remarkably consistent,
indicating that the translation has not significantly altered the underlying structure of the data.Figure 4: Comparison chart of embedding before and after translation for a set of data represented by the same
shape, with red indicating before translation and blue indicating after translation
A.6 The explanation of W/O MMD loss
We further demonstrate the role of MMD loss by modeling the loss function space. From the Figure 5,
it can be seen that the MMD loss can optimize the vector ϕtowards the to-be-attacked model’s words
embedding space.
