Abstract
Recent breakthroughs in preference alignment
have significantly improved Large Language
Models’ ability to generate texts that align with
human preferences and values. However, cur-
rent alignment metrics typically emphasize the
post-hoc overall improvement, while overlook-
ing a critical aspect: regression , which refers to
the backsliding on previously correctly-handled
data after updates. This potential pitfall may
arise from excessive fine-tuning on already
well-aligned data, which subsequently leads to
over-alignment and degeneration. To address
this challenge, we propose FlipGuard , a con-
strained optimization approach to detect and
mitigate update regression with focal attention.
Specifically, FlipGuard identifies performance
degradation using a customized reward charac-
terization and strategically enforces a constraint
to encourage conditional congruence with the
pre-aligned model during training. Comprehen-
sive experiments demonstrate that FlipGuard
effectively alleviates update regression while
demonstrating excellent overall performance,
with the added benefit of knowledge preserva-
tion while aligning preferences.
1 Introduction
As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly
permeate and revolutionize various industries and
professions, the need to guide LLM generations to
align with human preferences and meet specific re-
quirements becomes increasingly critical (Fernan-
des et al., 2023; Khalifa et al., 2020). Alignment
in LLMs emerges as a pivotal topic and various
techniques have been developed to build a safe and
controllable AI system (Ngo, 2022; Kenton et al.,
2021; Stiennon et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020;
Zhao et al., 2023).
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) is one of the most widely-used alignment

While the base model answers all questions indiscrim-
inately, the aligned model prevents harmful responses
by refusing to answer dangerous questions. However,
it becomes overly conservative, also refusing to answer
questions that are only mildly sensitive. In contrast,
FlipGuard effectively avoids answering harmful ques-
tions while providing careful responses to sensitive ones,
achieving a good balance.
techniques that involves explicitly fitting a reward
model to human preferences and has demonstrated
effectiveness in various applications (Christiano
et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al.,
2022; Xue et al., 2023). Alternatively, (Rafailov
et al., 2023) propose Direct Preference Optimiza-
tion (DPO), which leverages a mapping between
reward functions and optimal policies, eliminating
the need for reward modelling.
However, we discover that these popular align-
ment methods suffer from regression phenomenon,
meaning the model’s performance on a particular
task or dataset deteriorates after an update, which
it had previously performed well on1. One con-
crete example in Figure 1 is that, aligned models
may fail to address certain questions that were pre-
viously successfully handled, despite overall im-
proved alignment with human preference. These

degraded instances are termed as negative flips2.
The occurrence of negative flips can have var-
ious detrimental consequences. Firstly, it dimin-
ishes the overall improvement achieved through
the alignment process, thereby compromising its
effectiveness. Furthermore, negative flips can lead
to inconsistent and unreliable results, thus negative
user experiences and reduced trust, especially dur-
ing an era where LLMs are rapidly updating and
iterating, posing a significant challenge to achiev-
ing a comprehensive and trustworthy AI system.
Ideally, an alignment strategy should correct
model outputs only when they misalign with human
values or are considered inferior, while minimally
affecting the model’s output and preserving the
model’s integrity otherwise, since (excessive) align-
ment can potentially lead to underperformance and
knowledge forgetting (Bai et al., 2022; Lin et al.,
2023a; Zheng et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023). How-
ever, imposing conditional constraints to achieve
non-uniform alignment across different data points
poses a significant challenge. In this paper, to alle-
viate the problem of update regression in alignment
tasks, we propose FlipGuard , a constrained opti-
mization approach to detect and mitigate update
regression with focal attention. Specifically, as
outlined in Figure 2, our approach involves 1. cus-
tomizing a reward characterization to measure the
model’s performance, 2. determining the premise
of negative flips and 3. finally applying a focal
distillation to conform the aligned policy to the
pre-aligned counterpart when certain conditions
2Yan et al. (2021) initially define negative flips in image
classification tasks as samples correctly classified by the old
model but incorrectly by the new one.are triggered. This design helps the model provide
safe, preference-aligned responses while still offer-
ing informative answers, avoiding an overly conser-
vative approach that refuses to answer potentially
problematic questions. For instance, when asked
"What are the toughest questions in the world?", the
pre-aligned model provides satisfactory answers by
listing examples, whereas the aligned model πθ
tends to be overly conservative and refrains from
giving direct answers. In contrast, our approach
with FlipGuard enables the aligned model π′
θto
provide more accurate and informative answers.
Theprimary goal of FlipGuard is to reduce the
occurrences of negative flips, rather than increase
the overall win rate, by conditionally aligning the
learning policy πθtoπθ0, while minimally impact-
ing the original alignment strategy. This distin-
guishes FlipGuard from other alignment methods
that prioritize overall performance.
Our approach is intuitive, simple, and requires
minimal hyperparameter tuning, making it practi-
cal for mitigating negative flips in alignment tasks.
We evaluate FlipGuard on two alignment algo-
rithms, PPO and DPO, using four diverse prefer-
ence datasets and six academic benchmarks. The
results show that FlipGuard effectively reduces neg-
ative flips and enhances overall performance. Ad-
ditionally, FlipGuard helps preserve the intrinsic
knowledge of the pre-aligned model, as evidenced
by improved scores on academic benchmarks de-
signed to test a wide range of model abilities.
2 Related Work
A closely related research topic to our work is catas-
trophic forgetting in sequential learning (Robins,1995; Atkinson et al., 2018) and continual learning
(Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2019), a
phenomenon in machine learning where a model,
when exposed to new data, tends to forget previ-
ously acquired knowledge. Another related topic
is alignment tax (Bai et al., 2022), which refers to
the performance degradation of LLM on standard
knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. Model up-
date regression differs in that we focus on how the
model performs on the same task after updates.
2.1 Regression in traditional CV and NLP
tasks
The topic of backward compatibility in CV was
first introduced by Shen et al. (2020), who propose
to learn visual features that are compatible with old
ones to bypass recomputing features for previously
seen images in retrieval tasks. Yan et al. (2021)
formulate the regression problem in image classi-
fication tasks where a reference model is replaced
by the updated one, and they use negative flips to
refer to the samples that are incorrectly predicted
by the new model while correctly predicted by the
old one. To mitigate regression, they leverage focal
distillation to give more weight to certain samples
during training.
Model regression in NLP has prevalent presence
as well. Xie et al. (2021) firstly leverage knowledge
distillation and model ensemble to reduce negative
flips. A Backward-Congruent Re-ranking method
proposed by Cai et al. (2022) uses the old model as
a re-ranker to select a top structure from candidates
predicted by the new one, improving the accuracy
of the new model at the same time. (Lai et al., 2023)
propose to use "Gated Fusion" to mix predictions
between old and new models for the promotion of
backward compatibility.
However, these methods typically focus on clas-
sification tasks where the correctness of prediction
during training is definite, making it easier to en-
force a focal constraint. In contrast, during the
alignment of LLMs, determining the quality of in-
termediate model generations or the model itself is
non-trivial, which makes precise control challeng-
ing.
2.2 Regression in Alignment
There are various alignment methods proposed re-
cently, such as RLHF, DPO, RRHF (Yuan et al.,
2023), LIRE (Zhu et al., 2024), CPO (Xu et al.,
2024) and KTO (Ethayarajh et al., 2024). However,
to the best of our knowledge, research on updateregression in alignment is very limited. One line
of very recent work targets at reducing alignment
tax, whose focus is on mitigating model knowledge
degradation. Lin et al. (2023b) explores model
averaging by interpolating between pre- and post-
RLHF model weights, to achieve a more efficient
reward-tax Pareto front. Lu et al. (2024) propose
online merging optimizers for boosting rewards and
mitigating alignment tax, and Fu et al. (2024) pro-
pose to merge multiple sub-models trained with dif-
ferent data portions. Additionally, Experience Re-
play (Ouyang et al., 2022) mixes gradients of pre-
training data in the fine-tuning objective to fix the
performance regressions on public NLP datasets.
FlipGuard has a different focus on the post hoc
performance for the same preference alignment
task. This differentiates our approach from existing
works that concentrate on alignment tax. Moreover,
whereas the above methods largely fall under the
paradigm of model averaging or require access to
pre-training data, our approach explores regulariza-
tion techniques that operate in a distinct scope.
3 Preliminaries
Next we give the preliminaries of the two alignment
strategies that we focus on in this paper.
3.1 RLHF
RLHF is widely adopted in alignment tasks and
involves three steps:
Step 1 . Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on high-
quality datasets for downstream tasks using next-
token prediction loss.
Step 2 . Train a reward model using human feed-
back on pairwise preferences between chosen and
rejected responses. Specifically, prompt the SFT
model with queries xto generate response pairs,
then have human evaluators label the chosen and
rejected answers ycandyrfor each query. In prac-
tice, we parametrize a reward model (RM) rϕ(x, y)
to learn the latent preference through via negative
log-likelihood loss.
LR(rϕ,D) =−E(x,yc,yr)∼D
logσ(rϕ(x, yc)−rϕ(x, yr))
,(1)
where σis a logistic function. The trained RM
produces the log probability that a certain response
is preferred by human labelers.
Step 3 . RL fine-tuning which utilizes the learned
RM to provide feedback during learning. Specif-
ically, every generated completion will be scoredby the trained RM. The objective function aims to
maximize the overall return while not drifting too
far away from the SFT policy (Ouyang et al., 2022;
Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; Bai et al.,
2022). The reward in the RL fine-tuning is:
max

rϕ(x, y)
−βD KL
πθ(y|x)||πref(y|x)
.(2)
3.2 DPO
RLHF typically requires an RM to give explicit
rewards to the generated completions. To bypass
the training of RMs, (Rafailov et al., 2023) propose
to leverage implicit rewards defined by the policy
and the reference model. Specifically, they define
the implicit rewards as:
r(x, y) =βlogπθ(y|x)
πref(y|x), (3)
then the alignment problem becomes maximizing
the gap in implicit rewards of the response pair:
LDPO(πθ;πref) =−E(x,yc,yr)∼D

βlogπθ(yw|x)
πref(yw|x)−βlogπθ(yl|x)

4 Methodology
In this section, we delve into the technical intrica-
cies of our approach, providing a formal definition
of the problem and a detailed derivation of the the-
oretical framework of FlipGuard.
4.1 Notations
We begin by establishing the notation conventions
used throughout this work. Specifically, we denote
the pre-aligned and the aligned model as πθ0and
πθ, respectively, and π′
θthe FlipGuard-calibrated
model. We sometimes use the post-aligned model
and aligned model interchangeably depending on
the context. Please note that πθ0is an SFT model in
our experiments, and by "alignment" we primarily
focus on PPO and DPO, leaving other alignment
strategies for future research endeavors.
4.2 FlipGuard
The proposed FlipGuard objective relies on the def-
inition of the reward . At its core, negative flips
occur because the post-aligned policy produces re-
sponses with reduced human satisfaction, which
can be characterized by lower rewards , compared
to their pre-aligned counterparts.How do we define the reward? In the literature,
one popular method for illustrating the satisfac-
tion level of an LM generation ygiven any query
xis to assign a scalar “reward” score R(x, y)to
it. This is an explicit reward value that is widely
adopted in standard RL methods such as REIN-
FORCE (Williams, 1992) and its variants. Alter-
natively, Rafailov et al. (2023) uses an implicit
reward that is parameterized by the policy πθunder
a reference model to underline the relative pre-
ferred/dispreferred level of a certain response.
For standard RL methods such as PPO where
the responses are sampled from the training policy,
the most effective way is to directly compare the
reward scores between the policy response yπθand
the reference model response yπθ0. If the latter
has a higher score graded by RM, a negative flip
occurs.
For RL-free methods such as DPO, we have la-
beled chosen and rejected responses at hand. Under
this scenario, we need a different reward character-
ization. First we turn back to the optimal solution
to the KL-constrained reward objective in RLHF
derived mathematically by previous works (Peters
and Schaal, 2007; Korbak et al., 2022b,a; Rafailov
et al., 2023). It shows:
π∗(y|x) =1
Z(x)πθ0(y|x)er(x,y)
β, (5)
which is an explicit Energy Based Model (Hinton,
2002; LeCun et al., 2006) representation uniquely
determined by the original LM πθ0(Khalifa et al.,
2020), and Z(x) =P
yπθ0(y|x)er(x,y)
βis the par-
tition function.
It is straightforward to show that the correspond-
ing reward parameterization under the optimal pol-
icy is (Rafailov et al., 2023):
r∗(x, y) =βlogπ∗(y|x)
πθ0(y|x)+βlogZ(x).(6)
To this end, we have defined the reward char-
acterization for both PPO and DPO, and we next
develop the conceptual and theoretical framework
for the FlipGuard objective.
The premise of negative flips.
ForPPO , we assume negative flip happens when
given some query x:
R(x, yπθ0)−R(x, yπθ)> ϵ, (7)
where R(·)is the reward score from some RM and
ϵis a small positive constant.ForDPO , assume yis the target (chosen) response
from the supervised dataset, we formally define the
premise of negative flips as:
rπθ0(x, y)−rπθ(x, y)> ϵ, (8)
That is, for a given query xand target response y,
if the reward characterization defined in Equation 6
under initial policy πθ0is higher than that under
πθ, we assume there exists quality degradation for
the aligned model. Building on this assumption,
next we substitute Equation 6 into 8, through a
little algebraic manipulation the intractable term
logZ(x)cancels out and we are left with:
logπθ0(y|x)−logπθ(y|x)> ϵ, (9)
that is, a larger reward now boils down to a higher
log likelihood under πθ0thanπθ. This can also
be perceived as a higher confidence score under
target response defined by conditional probability
distribution given a question x(Tian et al., 2023).
To summarize, we conclude both cases for PPO
and DPO and denote Aas the collection of events
that conditions defined in Equation 7 or 9 are trig-
gered, and ra specific reward relationship between
πθ0andπθ, then we have:
1A(r) =(
1,ifr∈A
0,ifr /∈A(10)
This is our formal definition of negative flips.
Focal constraint. When it comes to conforming
one distribution to another, knowledge distillation
(KD) (Hinton et al., 2015) is a natural approach.
In our case, we only transfer knowledge from πθ0
toπθwhen a negative flip occurs, which echos
the concept of focal distillation (Yang et al., 2022).
Compared to traditional KD, focal constraint has
the advantage of reducing negative flips while pre-
serving positive flips, because it would not bias the
policy to the initial distribution "uniformly".
To summarize, FlipGuard has the following ob-
jective:
LFlipGuard (πθ;πθ0) =Lalign(πθ;πθ0)
+γ 1A(r)·D[πθ0(y|x)||πθ(y|x)],(11)
where Lalign(πθ;πθ0)is the original alignment ob-
jective and γthe hyperparameters controlling con-
straint weight. D(·||·)refers to distance function.
In this paper, we simply set D(·||·)a KL-
Divergence. Hereinafter, we move one step furtherby showing that minimizing the KL divergence be-
tween πθ0andπθis equivalent to minimizing the
Cross-Entropy (CE) in terms of them (Derivation
details in Appendix A ). The resulting formulation
of our FlipGuard objective becomes:
LFlipGuard (πθ;πθ0) =Lalign(πθ;πθ0)
−γEx,y 1A(r)·[logπθ(y|x)].(12)
Please note that yrefers to the target (winning)
response. In the case of PPO, it is the reference
response if it has a higher reward score, otherwise
the policy response, and for DPO, it is just the
chosen response from the dataset.
A deeper look at the FlipGuard objective. Appar-
ently, FlipGuard objective is a flexible combination
of the alignment loss and a CE (or SFT) loss. In
practice, it is common to apply SFT first to equip
the model with the ability to follow instructions
before beginning the preference alignment process.
However, it often happens that the model becomes
"overwhelmed" during alignment training, result-
ing in a loss of its ability to follow instructions or
forgetting its previously acquired knowledge. In
this context, FlipGuard can be seen as performing
an "augmentation" operation on the original align-
ment goal by transferring the abilities and knowl-
edge it has previously acquired.
5 Experiments
5.1 Experimental settings
Datasets. To comprehensively evaluate if the pro-
posed FlipGuard can generalize to different tasks,
we make use of four datasets that are widely used
in alignment tasks. UltraFeedback is a large-scale,
fine-grained, diverse preference dataset (Cui et al.,
2023) for training alignment models. We also
leverage HH-RLHF , a human-labeled preference
dataset on helpfulness and harmlessness from Bai
et al. (2022) and Summarization dataset from Sti-
ennon et al. (2020). Besides, we employ a Chinese
CV ALUES dataset (Xu et al., 2023) that aims at
measuring the model values in terms of responsi-
bility and safety in Chinese language. Please find
more statistics of the datasets in Appendix B.
Baselines. We begin by fine-tuning the pre-trained
Mistral 7B on a portion of the chosen responses
in the datasets, which helps mitigate the distribu-
tion shift between the true data distribution and
the reference policy (Rafailov et al., 2023). TheDatasets Alignment ConstraintNFR (%)↓ Win rate (%)↑

resulting models, denoted as πθ0, then serve as the
pre-aligned policy for subsequent experiments. For
the Chinese CV ALUES dataset, ChatGLM3-6B is
used as the base model. We also discard the "fil-
tering function" in Equation 10 to apply a full CE
loss, which is in contrast to our focal constraint, so
we term this method as "KD" hereinafter. The ex-
periments are conducted on 4 80GB Nvidia A100
GPUs. We set γto 0.005 for Summarization and
0.01 for other datasets unless otherwise specified,
with more discussion in Section 5.2. More method-
specific hyperparameter settings are specified in
Appendix C.
Evaluation setup. We leverage the Negative Flip
Rate (NFR) ( our main goal ) as the main metric
to assess the model’s ability to mitigate the nega-
tive flips, which is defined as the losing case of the
aligned model compared to the SFT model (Yan
et al., 2021; Cai et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2021), along
with the win rate, i.e., the positive flip rate ( extra
bonus ). Additionally, we also assess the models’
general ability on academic benchmarks as wellas MT-Bench to see how the FlipGuard genuinely
affects the aligned model. Since a pure human eval-
uation would be impossible in terms of the sizes of
the test sets (in thousands), we leverage three prox-
ies to provide both direct and pairwise assessment.
Firstly, we employ well-trained RMs to directly
score the responses and determine negative flips
based on scores. Particularly, we use UltraRM-13b
to evaluate with UltraFeedback since it achieves
SOTAs over open-sources models (Cui et al., 2023)
and DeBERTa V3 Large to evaluate HH-RLHF
and Summarization since it is widely used in these
tasks (Touvron et al., 2023). Besides, the recent
Llama3 70B (AI@Meta, 2024) is considered a pow-
erful competitor against GPT-4 but much faster and
affordable, so we include Llama3 70B for evalua-
tion as well. Please find more details pre-defined
evaluation criteria/prompts in Appendix F.
5.2 Experimental results and analysis
FlipGuard consistently mitigates negative flips
without sacrificing win rates. We present NFRand win rates for all datasets in Table 1, disregard-
ing the score changes within (−0.1,0.1)to miti-
gate the influence of noise when evaluating with
RM. Due to the absence of a widely adopted RM
for CV ALUES, direct comparisons with RM for
this dataset are omitted.
FlipGuard vs. KD . KD serves as an abla-
tion study to test the effectiveness of the "filter-
ing mechanism" in Equation 10. Our experiments
demonstrate that FlipGuard’s filtering mechanism
is more flexible and introduces greater improve-
ments across various alignment tasks and bench-
marks. Both KD and FlipGuard significantly re-
duce NFR compared to PPO/DPO, supporting our
argument that update regression is widespread dur-
ing alignment. Moreover, FlipGuard consistently
demonstrates superior or comparable performance
across all datasets compared to KD. This can be
attributed to its balanced approach, with the focal
mechanism effectively mitigating negative flips by
adhering to the pre-aligned policy while actively
learning during alignment. This enables FlipGuard
to explore new alignments and exploit existing
knowledge. In contrast, the uniform constraint of
naive KD may overly restrict the model’s learning,
resulting in suboptimal performance.
FlipGuard increases most of the abilities on MT-
Bench. To systematically evaluate the model’s abil-
ity of instruction-following, we employ the widely-
used MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2024). Figure 3
depicts that FlipGuard enhances the model in Cod-
ing, Writing, Roleplay,etc., with an exception in
the Reasoning ability. Our hypothesis is that the dy-
namic incorporation of constraints ensures that the
model adheres more closely to the desired output
distribution, which is beneficial to tasks that rely
heavily on structured and precise outputs, while
might inadvertently restrict the model’s flexibility
in reasoning scenarios, where more nuanced and
less predictable responses are often required.
FlipGuard maintains or boosts model perfor-
mance on academic benchmarks. Even though
we have a distinct research focus than reducing
"alignment tax", it is still worthwhile to investigate
how the alignment strategy influences the models’
general knowledge and ability.
We evaluated the models aligned with Ultra-
Feedback against a series of academic benchmarks:

et al., 2020), TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021), Hel-

laSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), Winogrande (ai2,
2019) and GSM8K (Hendrycks et al., 2020). The
results indicate that FlipGuard better preserves or
even boosts the abilities of the base SFT model
most of the time, compared to the original align-
ment objective and the KD constraint. One in-
triguing observation is that DPO severely damages
the math reasoning ability on GSM8K, as is also
observed by Pal et al. (2024), who proposed a
reference-based SFT loss to avoid this failure mode
by maintaining the high log-likelihood of the pre-
ferred completions. Even FlipGuard is not pro-
posed to specifically fix this failure mode of DPO,
we see it helps preserve most part of the math rea-
soning ability.
Exploring the KL and reward trade-off. To ex-
plore the training dynamics of FlipGuard, we exam-
ine the KL divergence and reward variation during
the alignment process. As shown in Figure 4 , ap-
plying FlipGuard leads to reduced KL divergence
compared to the original alignment objective, while
resulting in KL divergence that is larger or compa-
rable to the KD approach. This observation aligns
with our expectations, as the constraint aims to
maintain consistency between the policy πθand
the initial policy πθ0.
Moreover, Figure 5 depicts the variation in re-
wards during training. Specifically, the reward
scores from the RM for PPO closely align with the
original objective, with KD displaying significantly
lower rewards. This outcome is expected since the
original PPO objective maximizes overall rewards,
whereas FlipGuard adjusts this objective slightly to
mitigate negative flips. Regarding DPO, both Flip-
Guard and KD exhibit significantly higher rewards
for the chosen response, indicating that the log ra-
tio between the aligned and the pre-aligned modelAlignment Constraint ARC MMLU TruthfulQA HellaSwag GSM8K Winogrande Average

is decreasing. This pronounced reward increase is
consistent with the more significant performance
gain observed when applying FlipGuard to DPO
compared to PPO, as shown in Table 1.
Robust performance of FlipGuard across var-
ious hyperparameters. The hyperparameter γ
plays a crucial role in determining the level of Flip-
Guard constraint, with smaller values of γgener-
ally recommended to avoid excessive interference
with the original training objective. Conversely,
ifγis too large, the "CE" loss can dominate the
total objective function, potentially undermining
the primary alignment goals. In our experiments
on UltraFeedback, we explored different values
ofγin{0,0.005,0.01,0.02,0.05}, where γ= 0
represents the original alignment objective with-
out FlipGuard constraints. Figure 6 illustrates the
corresponding win rates and negative flip rates for
these γvalues, assessed using Llama3 70B as an
evaluator. We observe moderate fluctuations in
performance, indicating that FlipGuard exhibits ro-
bustness across a range of γvalues, provided theyare within a reasonably small range.

Application of FlipGuard across different base
models. We investigate the impact of utilizing
different base models within the FlipGuard frame-
work. Specifically, we experiment with three ad-
ditional 7B models, Llama2-Base, Llama2-Chat,
and Mistral-Instruct on UltraFeedback. The evalua-
tion includes reporting NFR and win rates assessed
by RM and Llama3 70B, showing consistency
with our main results presented in Table 1, where
Mistral-Base serves as the base model. These find-
ings underscore the capability of FlipGuard to ef-
fectively adapt to various base models, thereby
demonstrating its versatility and robustness.

Table 3: Performance of FlipGuard on different
base models. FlipGuard demonstrates effectiveness in
mitigating negative flips with different base models.Trade-off between ϵvalues and the win rates.
Specifically, a larger ϵvalue reduces the likelihood
of FlipGuard being triggered (the reward score for
the pre-aligned model needs to be far larger than
that for the aligned model), whereas a smaller ϵ
value increases its likelihood, making the method
more sensitive to changes in the reward score. Ta-
ble 4 suggests that for PPO, the explicit reward
scores (scalar value from pre-trained RM) exhibit
more noise than the implicit reward (calculated as
the log ratio) for DPO. Our experiments indicate
that setting ϵwithin (0, 0.1) is a good starting point.
Larger values (0.2) tend to reduce the effective-
ness of FlipGuard, as the objective degrades to the
original alignment loss.

6 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce FlipGuard, a frame-
work aimed at mitigating model update regression
in preference alignment for LLMs. By integrating
reward-based focal constraints, FlipGuard mini-
mizes performance degradation while preserving or
even enhancing the overall performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate FlipGuard’s effectiveness
in this regard. In this paper, our primary goal is
to highlight an underappreciated research scope in
alignment tasks. This work marks our initial effort,
and our future work will focus on refining these
methods for broader applicability and enhanced
optimizing performance.
7 Limitations
This paper acknowledges several limitations that
warrant further investigation. Firstly, the applica-
bility of FlipGuard has been validated only on PPO
and DPO, leaving many other popular alignment
algorithms untested. Future work should explore
designing appropriate reward characterizations or
leveraging other method-specific strategies to de-
termine the premise of negative flips for these algo-
rithms. Additionally, our focus has been on using
KL divergence as the distance function to encour-
age congruence between two distributions. This
approach can be expanded to include a broaderrange of distance functions, such as the Wasser-
stein distance and Jensen-Shannon divergence.
8 Impact Statements
With the enhanced capabilities of LLMs, there are
heightened risks such as untruthful answers, decep-
tion, biased opinions, and harmful content, which
can lead to severe consequences. To better manage
and guide model outputs to align with human inten-
tions and values, it is crucial to develop techniques
that ensure ethical model behavior. Considerable
research has been focused on creating ethical frame-
works for AI systems, which span various stages
including data collection and processing, algorithm
design, and application implementation. We as-
pire that our work contributes to this field, making
LLMs safer and more controllable for human use.

A KL divergence to CE loss
In this section, we prove that minimizing the KL
divergence is equivalent to minimizing the CE loss
(from Equation 11 to Equation 12) under our set-
tings.
First let πθ0(y|x)andπθ(y|x)be the pre- and
post-aligned policies. The KL divergence from
πθ0(y|x)toπθ(y|x)is defined as:
DKL(πθ0(y|x)∥πθ(y|x))
=Ex,y
πθ0(y|x) logπθ0(y|x)
πθ(y|x)
.(13)
We can expand the definition of KL divergence:
DKL(πθ0(y|x)||πθ(y|x))
=Ex,y(πθ0(y|x) logπθ0(y|x))
−Ex,y(πθ0(y|x) logπθ(y|x)).(14)
The first term is the negative entropy of πθ0(y|x),
which we denote as H(πθ0), thus, the KL diver-
gence can be rewritten as:
DKL(πθ0(y|x)∥πθ(y|x)) =H(πθ0, πθ)−H(πθ0)
(15)
where H(πθ0, πθ) =−Ex,yπθ0(y|x) logπθ(y|x)
is the Cross-Entropy between πθ0andπθ. Since
the entropy H(πθ0)is a constant with respect to
πθ, minimizing the KL divergence is equivalent to
minimizing the Cross-Entropy.
Since we only enforce the constraint when πθ0
is considered superior, given a target sequence y,
we can set πθ0(y|x) = 1 (same practice in Xu
et al. (2024)), then minimizing the KL divergence
is equivalent to minimizing the SFT loss.
B Dataset details
In this section, we give a detailed description of the
datasets we use for the experiments. For PPO, we
follow the default setting of DeepSpeed-Chat (Yao
et al., 2023) and split each training set into a ratio
of 2:4:4 for SFT, reward modeling and RL training,
respectively, and the SFT model in phase 1 is set
as the starting point for DPO training to mitigate
distribution discrepancy. Specifically, we directly
use the datasets in the links provided in Section 5,except for the summarization task where we em-
ploy Summarize From Feedback from Stiennon
et al. (2020) and follow the code3to process the
data. All the datasets are subject to the terms of the
MIT License (Apache-2.0 license for CV ALUES)
and are utilized in accordance with their intended
purposes. The statistics of the utilized datasets are
listed in Table 5.
Datasets # Train # Test
UltraFeedback 61.1k 1k
HH-RLHF 161k 8.6k
Summarization 124.9k 50k
CV ALUES 116.5k 29k
Table 5: Benchmark dataset statistics for the conducted
experiments.
Please note that for a quick and affordable evalu-
ation, we sample 1k queries from HH-RLHF and
Summarization and the entire test set from Ultra-
Feedback (test-gen split) for automatic evaluation.
For the CV ALUES dataset, we test with the valu-
able and insightful questions ( 0.6k) collected from
experts.
C Implementations
Across all the experiments, we set gradient accu-
mulation to 2 steps and training epochs to 2. We
apply a cosine learning rate schedule and weight
decay of 0.1 on the preference optimization dataset.
Lora with DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 is also applied for
memory optimization. For PPO, we follow the de-
fault hyperparameter settings in DeepSpeed Chat,
a fast and scalable framework for enabling end-to-
end RLHF training. The experiments are run under
a random seed. Specifically, we set the learning
rate to 9.65e-6 for UltraFeedback and HH-RLHF,
and 1e-6 for Summarization and CV ALUES, with
both PPO and DPO. We set βvalue in DPO as
0.05 for Summarization and 0.1 for other datasets.
Please note that we did not run an extensive grid
search to determine the best hyperparameter set-
tings for different alignment strategies, so it is not
appropriate to directly compare PPO results with
DPO. However, we strictly maintain a consistent
hyperparameter setting for each alignment strat-
egy when comparing with FlipGuard. Specifically,
when running DPO on CV ALUES, we set γ=1, be-
cause during our implementations DPO severely
3https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/
DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/PRO/train/summarize_
preprocess_datadamages the model’s instruction-following ability
and the model quickly degenerates, despite that we
tried different learning rates and βvalues for DPO.
Therefore, we increase γto 1 for this specific case
to bring out better performance.
D Qualitative analysis
In this section, we provide some model answers
aligned with different strategies for a better under-

Query2 was yanukovich really pro-russian? what reasons did he have for preferring
Russia to the EU assoication deal
SFT ( πθ0) Yes, Viktor Yanukovych was generally considered to be pro-Russian during
his presidency of Ukraine from 2010 to 2014. His preference for Russia over
the EU association deal was based on several factors, including: 1. Economic
ties: Ukraine had strong economic ties with Russia, particularly in the energy
sector. Russia was a major supplier of natural gas to Ukraine, and Yanukovych
believed that closer ties with Russia would help Ukraine maintain...
PPO Yes, former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich was generally considered
to be pro-Russian. He had close ties with Russia and was seen as a Russian
ally. His decision to back out of the EU association deal in 2013, which sparked
the Euromaidan protests and ultimately led to his ouster, was seen as a major
setback for Ukraine’s European aspirations. Some reasons Yanukovich may
have had for prefer...
+FlipGuard Yes, Viktor Yanukovych, the former President of Ukraine, was indeed pro-
Russian. His preference for Russia over the EU association deal was based on
several factors, including economic interests, historical ties, and geopolitical
considerations. 1. Economic Interests: Russia was Ukraine’s largest trading
partner and provided significant financial support to the country. Yanukovych
believed that closer ties with Russia would bring economic benefits, such as
cheaper gas prices and increased investment...DPO Yanukovych, Ukraine’s President, appeared pro-Russian due to various reasons,
primarily driven by geopolitical and economic factors. 1. Geopolitical ties:
Historically, Ukraine and Russia share strong geopolitical ties, primarily due
to their shared Slavic heritage and border-contiguity. Russia has traditionally
maintained close relations with Ukraine, offering it a counterweight to Western
influence. 2. Energy dependence: Ukraine rel...
+FlipGuard Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was indeed pro-Russian. There
are several reasons for his preference for Russia over an Association Agreement
with the European Union. 1. Energy Dependence: Ukraine is a significant
consumer of Russian energy, and its reliance on Russian gas and oil supplies
made Yanukovych wary of closer ties with the EU. He feared that an Association
Agreement with the EU would lead to increased energy prices and potential
disruptions in energy...
Table 6: The two test cases above demonstrate the typical negative flips that occur during alignment. In the first
query, the user requests a specific configuration file, while in the second query, the user inquires about the reasons
for preferring a particular option over Russia. Notably, the SFT model provides direct and favorable responses to
these questions. In contrast, the PPO/DPO-aligned model tends to avoid giving direct answers, instead discussing
less relevant topics. Meanwhile, the FlipGuard model provides concise and on-point responses.

Query2 : CV 领域中，相较于高层次认知，为啥会更关注低层次感知?
SFT ( πθ0)在CV领域中,相对于高层次认知,低层次感知被认为更重要,因为它们是构
建更准确和有效的模型所必需的基本元素。低层次感知包括诸如颜色、
形状、纹理和空间信息等方面的感知,这些感知对于图像分类、目标检
测和识别等任务至关重要。相比之下 ,高层次认知包括诸如逻辑推理、
情感分析和自然语言处理等方面的能力,虽然它们在某些任务中可能比
低层次感知更重要,但在大多数任务中,低层次感知更为关键。
PPO 在CV领域中，相对于高层次认知，低层次感知的重要性更加凸显。因
为低层次感知可以帮助模型更好地理解和适应环境，提高模型的鲁棒性
和泛化能力。此外，低层次感知还可以为高层次认知提供有用的信息，
帮助模型更好地进行决策和优化。因此，在CV领域中，低层次感知的
重要性不容忽视。+FlipGuard 在CV领域中，相对于高层次认知，我们更关注低层次感知，因为低层
次感知是构建更准确、更可靠模型的重要基础。高层次认知虽然能够帮
助我们快速地识别物体和场景，但是低层次感知能够提供更加详细的信
息，帮助我们更好地理解场景和物体之间的关系，从而提高模型的准确
性和可靠性。此外，低层次感知还能够帮助我们避免一些高层次认知中
可能出现的问题，比如过拟合和欠拟合等。因此，在CV领域中，我们
更注重低层次感知的培养和训练。
DPO您好，我是人工智能助手。在CV领域，确实低层次感知对抗高层次认
知更为关注。这是因为低层次感知对于图像识别等任务具有重要作用，
能够提供丰富的信息，帮助识别目标。
+FlipGuard 在CV领域中，相较于高层次认知，我们会更关注低层次感知，主要是
因为低层次感知是构建更准确模型的重要基础。具体来说，低层次感知
可以帮助我们更好地理解图像中的物体、场景和动作等基本元素，从而
为后续的高层次认知提供更为准确的输入。此外，低层次感知还可以帮
助我们处理图像中的噪声和模糊等复杂情况，提高模型的鲁棒性。因
此，在CV领域中，我们会更注重低层次感知的研究和应用。
Table 7: The first query asks about the benefits of studying paleography. In response, the SFT model provides
clear and practical benefits, highlighting how it can improve personal knowledge and enhance career prospects.
In contrast, the PPO/DPO-aligned model offers vague and unrealistic benefits, focusing on the perspective of the
country or society rather than the individual. This suggests that during alignment, the model is prone to giving
"safe" answers that will not go wrong but may lack specific analysis in terms of the question itself. The second
query inquires about the emphasis on low-level perception over high-level cognition in the field of Computer Vision.
In response, the SFT model provides detailed and reasonable explanations, whereas the PPO/DPO model resorts to
grandiose language, lacking concrete and persuasive specifics. In contrast, the FlipGuard calibrated models provide
more direct and accurate answers.E Quantitative analysis
In this section, we provide the scatter plots of the
reward scores of pre- and post-aligned models on
UltraFeedback. In Figure 7, we see that applying
FlipGuard mitigates the instance-level score drop
(measured by UltraRM-13B) from 56% to 47% for
DPO and from 38% to 34% for PPO. With Flip-
Guard, the data points below the diagonal line are
fewer and lighter-colored, showcasing its effective-
ness.

F Evaluation prompts for Llama3 70B
and GPT-4
In this section, we provide the evaluation details
and the corresponding prompts for evaluating with
Llama3 70B and GPT-4. We randomly select 1,000
test samples from each test dataset for evaluation
with Llama3-70B, and 100 samples for evaluation
with GPT-4. For reward models that assign individ-
ual response scores, we regard samples receiving
scores lower than the pre-aligned scores by a cer-
tain margin (0.1 in our experiments) as negative
flips. This helps mitigate the effect of noise in re-
ward modeling. For Llama3 70B and GPT-4, we
conduct pairwise comparisons by directly asking
the model to compare the two responses and pick
the better one, and we only tally a negative flip
when both runs deem the response inferior.
Next we give automatic evaluation prompts. For
UltraFeedback and HH-RLHF, the prompt design
is adopted and modified from MT-Bench:Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate
the quality of the responses provided by two
