Abstract
We present Multi-expert Prompting1, a novel
enhancement of ExpertPrompting (Xu et al.,
2023), designed to improve the large lan-
guage model (LLM) generation. Specifically, it
guides an LLM to fulfill an input instruction by
simulating multiple experts, aggregating their
responses, and selecting the best among indi-
vidual and aggregated responses. This pro-
cess is performed in a single chain of thoughts
through our seven carefully designed subtasks
derived from the Nominal Group Technique
(Ven and Delbecq, 1974), a well-established
decision-making framework. Our evaluations
demonstrate that Multi-expert Prompting sig-
nificantly outperforms ExpertPrompting and
comparable baselines in enhancing the truth-
fulness, factuality, informativeness, and use-
fulness of responses while reducing toxicity
and hurtfulness. It further achieves state-of-
the-art truthfulness by outperforming the best
baseline by 8.69% with ChatGPT. Multi-expert
Prompting is efficient, explainable, and highly
adaptable to diverse scenarios, eliminating the
need for manual prompt construction.
1 Introduction
Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) (Rad-
ford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery
et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2022; Touvron et al., 2023) ac-
quire extensive knowledge during training, demon-
strating exceptional abilities as general-purpose
problem solvers. As they have made increasing
impacts on human life, it is essential to ensure
these systems align with human intentions by im-
proving their reliability, safety, and usefulness to
meet users’ expectations (Wang et al., 2023b).
Among the alignment methods, recent studies
(Li et al., 2023a; Park et al., 2023; Do et al., 2023;
Wang et al., 2024) highlight that LLMs can mimic
expected behaviors of specific agents when cast

Figure 1: An overview of Multi-expert Prompting with an
ExpertQA (Malaviya et al., 2023) example. ExpertPrompting
(Xu et al., 2023) provides a one-sided view, concluding “un-
ethical" while Multi-expert Prompting encompasses multiple
viewpoints leading to a comprehensively multifaceted answer.
with sufficient descriptions. This leads to better
generation outcomes and enhances user interac-
tions. Notably, Xu et al. (2023) introduce Expert-
Prompting directing LLMs to answer questions as
generated experts. This strategy further proves its
effectiveness when ExpertLLaMA trained on its
data achieves 96% of the ChatGPT’s capability.
However, is relying on a single expert LLM suf-
ficient for diverse user queries? Our answer is no.
Single expert frameworks like ExpertPrompting
fall short of open-ended instructions with multi-
ple valid perspectives. For instance, in response to
the question “Is it ethical to eat meat?” in Fig. 1,
ExpertPrompting casts the LLM as an Ethicist of-
fering a simplistic answer, labeling it as unethical.
This approach introduces bias and a dismissive at-
titude towards other perspectives, such as those of
non-vegetarians. Ideally, responses to such ques-
tions should encompass various other viewpoints
addressing multiple dimensions of the issue, such
as nutritional and environmental aspects. This high-
lights that a single expert can introduce biases and
limit the depth needed for considering varied per-
spectives in addressing open-ended instructions .
Inspired by the above observation, we present a
novel and efficient extension of ExpertPromptingarXiv:2411.00492v1  [cs.CL]  1 Nov 2024named Multi-expert Prompting, which addresses
the need for multiple perspectives. It involves two
main steps (Fig. 2). First, given an input instruc-
tion, Multi-expert Prompting instructs an LLM to
generate nexpert identities with their concise, one-
sentence role descriptions tailored to the instruc-
tion in a zero-shot prompting style. Unlike Ex-
pertPrompting (Xu et al., 2023), which relies on
generating detailed role descriptions by few-shot
hand-crafted demonstrations, our approach does
not require demonstrations and is more versatile as
detailed descriptions are unnecessary (§6.1). Multi-
expert Prompting then casts the LLM as distinct
experts, each responding to the instruction indepen-
dently. Second, it chooses a single best response by
aggregating the individual responses and evaluat-
ing it together with individual ones through a novel,
seven-subtask method in a single chain of thought
(Wei et al., 2022) following Nominal Group Tech-
nique (NGT; Ven and Delbecq, 1974).
Multi-expert Prompting is related to recent ef-
forts in reasoning over multi-agent responses, such
as Multi-agent Debate (Liang et al., 2023) and Uni-
versal Self-consistency (USC) (Chen et al., 2023b).
It distinguishes itself by aggregating expert re-
sponses in a single turn without iterative refinement.
Moreover, its response aggregation is based on the
human-designed NGT framework, contrasting with
the LLM-generated plans in AutoGen (Wu et al.,
2023) and AutoAgents (Chen et al., 2023a). Fi-
nally, it differs from MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2023)
by employing diverse domain experts to address
questions in parallel, instead of in sequence.
Multi-expert Prompting is the first to tackle the
challenge of aggregating multi-agent long-form
responses in a single turn based on well-studied
perspectives from management sciences. It sig-
nificantly outperforms baselines in improving the
truthfulness, factuality, toxicity, hurtfulness, infor-
mativeness, and usefulness of LLMs by leveraging
only three experts, achieving state-of-the-art truth-
fulness. In addition, it is highly adaptable, explain-
able, and beneficial for open-ended tasks where
diverse expert opinions are valued.
2 Background
We introduce ExpertPrompting (Xu et al., 2023)
and the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) (Ven
and Delbecq, 1974), both serving as foundational
elements for Multi-expert Prompting.ExpertPrompting (Xu et al., 2023). Expert-
Prompting is a prompting technique designed to
enhance the responses of an LLM by leveraging the
model’s capability to answer as experts. Given an
input instruction, it begins by prompting the LLM
to generate a paragraph-long expert identity that
best fulfills the instruction through carefully crafted
few-shot demonstrations. Then, it directs the LLM
to respond as the generated expert. However, it
can bias the model’s response toward the generated
expert — a critical weakness (Fig. 1).
Nominal Group Technique (NGT) (Ven and Del-
becq, 1974). The NGT is a structured decision-
making process that aids teams in identifying prob-
lems and generating solutions. It effectively orga-
nizes group ideas, combining individual judgments,
particularly useful in scenarios marked by uncer-
tainty or disagreement. Widely utilized in business
and government, NGT typically involves 4steps:
NGT 1. Idea generation. Each team member
independently writes down their ideas.
NGT 2. Round-robin idea recording. Ideas
are shared in a round-robin fashion and recorded
for all to see without discussion and elaboration.
NGT 3. Discussion of the list of ideas. The
participants discuss each idea on the list so that
they are clear about the meaning of the ideas.
NGT 4. Voting. Members identify key ideas,
rank-order preferences (optional), record votes
(agreements, conflicts), and discuss the voting.
3 Multi-expert Prompting
In deployment, when presented with an input in-
struction I, an LLM Mis expected to generate a
response Awhile ensuring informativeness, useful-
ness, truthfulness, non-toxicity, factuality, and non-
hurtfulness. Multi-expert Prompting is designed
for this goal and consists of two steps: (1) Experts

aggregation . In the first step, Mis instructed to
generate nexperts {(E1, D1), ...,(En, Dn)}with

Figure 2: Overview of Multi-expert Prompting: (1) Experts & responses generation (§3.1) and (2) Aggregating expert responses
(§3.2). Given an input instruction, the first step targets generating expert identities that best fulfill the instruction and expert
responses, while the second step focuses on aggregating and selecting the best from individual and combined expert responses.
3.1 1st Step: Experts & Responses Generation
Motivated by NGT 1 and 2, this step aims to sim-
ulateMas multiple experts to generate expert an-
swers independently. Given I, we first instruct M
to generate a list of nexperts capable of answer-
ingIthoroughly. Each ith expert is a tuple of
(Ei, Di)where Eiis the expert’s identity and Di
is a one-sentence description of its expertise and
responsibilities. Formally:
{(E1, D1), . . . , (En, Dn)}:=GM([IE, I])(1)
where IEis the (expert, responsibility) pair gen-
eration instruction. We enforce three constraints
on generating experts in Eq. (1) which are speci-
fied in IE: the experts should be diverse, Eiis a
general expert, and Diis its short clarification. For
the first constraint, we promote diversity among
experts to cultivate a range of perspectives, enhanc-
ing the quality of the final response, as noted by
Schulz-Hardt et al. (2000). Regarding the final con-
straint, Diis designed to be more versatile than the
detailed descriptions used in ExpertPrompting (Xu
et al., 2023), which relies on hand-crafted few-shot
demonstrations, which we find unnecessary (§6.1).
For each expert, we ask the LLM Mto generate
a long-form answer A:
Ai:=GM([I, Ei, Di]) (2)
Both Eqs. (1) and (2) are efficiently performed
under the zero-shot setting.3.2 2nd Step: Expert Responses Aggregation
Aggregating long-form expert responses
{a1, ..., a n}into a final one is challenging,
even for humans. Motivated by NGT and prior
studies (Wei et al., 2022; Khot et al., 2023), we
argue that every expert should contribute to the
final response. Thus, we decompose the task into
seven well-designed subtasks aiming to identify
commonalities, necessitate the consolidation of
information, and resolve conflicts via majority
voting. We weight all the experts equally to
prevent blind trust in expert opinions , minimizing
the group’s vulnerability to biases (Önkal et al.,
2009). Specifically, Mefficiently fulfills these
subtasks in a single zero-shot chain of thoughts
(Kojima et al., 2022).
Subtask 1 (S1): Generating agreed viewpoints.
This subtask aims to establish a consensus among
experts’ answers, inspired by NGT 4. Specifically,
the LLM generates viewpoints that more than half
of the experts agree on. These are reliable and
identified earliest to confirm widely accepted infor-
mation, providing a foundation for next steps.
Subtask 2 (S2): Generating conflicted view-
points. Given the diverse backgrounds of multi-
ple experts, conflicts are inevitable. Identifying
conflicted viewpoints is crucial to resolving the
conflicts. Hence, the LLM lists the conflicted view-
points with specified expert identities in detail for
the subsequent resolution.
Subtask 3 (S3): Resolving the conflicts in S2.
Resolving the above conflicts is critical for correc-tion purposes and reducing experts’ biases, follow-
ing NGT 4. We instruct the LLM to address the
disagreements using its knowledge by reviewing
the agreed viewpoints in S1 to judge conflicted
viewpoints carefully.
Subtask 4 (S4): Generating isolated view-
points. Viewpoints that are not identified by S1
and S3, and are unique from each response, are
now generated. These unique perspectives can pro-
vide valuable information without being conflicted
among experts. They are crucial to ensure a diverse,
comprehensive, and insightful response.
Subtask 5 (S5): Collecting S1, S3, S4 view-
points. The LLM collects the viewpoints obtained
from S1, S2, and S4 which appear in the final ag-
gregated response. This step ensures transparency
and explainability of the arguments included in the
final response.
Subtask 6 (S6): Generating the aggregated
response. The LLM composes a comprehensive
response by integrating the viewpoints gathered
from S5 as the experts’ aggregated response.
Subtask 7 (S7): Select the best among the ag-
gregated and individual expert responses. The
aggregated response in S6 may not be optimal. If
a majority of experts provide poor answers, the
aggregated answer may suffer. Thus, this step is
designed to choose the best among individual ex-
pert answers and the aggregated one, focusing on
factual accuracy and usefulness. Importantly, this
step does not generate a new answer, nor does it
reveal evaluation metrics; it simply selects the most
factual and useful response for all tasks.
In summary, Multi-expert Prompting composes
a response by merging common, resolved-conflict,
and unique viewpoints, following the NGT model.
It further selects the best response from individual
experts and the merged response, crucial for avoid-
ing poor merged outcomes. Our human evaluation
shows that the zero-shot performance of bench-
marked LLMs is good enough. However, for more
complex aggregations requiring specific formats,
we recommend one-/few-shot prompting.
4 Evaluation
We show that Multi-expert Prompting greatly im-
proves reliability and safety (§4.1) and the informa-
tiveness and usefulness (§4.2) over the baselines.
Baselines. We compare Multi-expert Prompt-
ing with six strong baselines: (B1) Zero-shot ;
(B2) Zero-shot-CoT (Kojima et al., 2022); (B3)Self-refine (Madaan et al., 2023) which interac-
tively utilizes LLMs to feedback and refine the
response; (B4) Universal Self-consistency (Chen
et al., 2023b) which prompts LLMs to generate
multiple responses and selects the most consis-
tent; (B5) Multi-agent Debate (Liang et al., 2023)
which simulates two agents with opposing perspec-
tives engaging in several rounds of debate to refine
the response; and the aforementioned (B6) Expert-
Prompting (Xu et al., 2023).
Furthermore, three Multi-expert Prompting vari-
ants are also assessed where our first step (§3.1) is
altered: (B7) Fixed Temp. + Our Aggregation
uses a single temperature to sample nresponses;
(B8) Var Temp. + Our Aggregation samples n
responses by nvarying temperatures; (B9) Expert-
Prompting + Our Aggregation generates nre-
sponses with one expert identity found by Expert-
Prompting. Our experiments are conducted on two
strong open- and closed-source LLMs: ChatGPT
(gpt-3.5-turbo-0613) (OpenAI, 2022) and Mistral
(-7B-it v0.2) (Jiang et al., 2023). Details are pro-
vided in Appx.-B.
Metrics. We evaluate the methods on six criteria
for long-form generation tasks: (C1) Truthfulness
measuring how models imitate human falsehoods;
(C2) Factuality verifying the factuality; (C3) Toxi-
cityassessing the toxicity biases; (C4) Hurtfulness

ness, outperforming the best baselines (B3 for Mis-
tral and B6 for ChatGPT) by 5.27% and8.69%
with Mistral and ChatGPT, respectively. It achieves
a new state-of-the-art on TruthfulQA-Generation
with ChatGPT, surpassing the current SOTA of
87.97% (Li et al., 2023b). We explain the sig-
nificant truthfulness improvement with the demo-
cratic theory (Cunningham, 2002): aggregated
output moderated by multiple experts positively
contributes to higher truthfulness. Second, by
incorporating diverse expert perspectives, Multi-
expert Prompting corrects experts’ biases, elimi-
nates harmful elements, significantly enhances fac-
tuality, completely eliminates toxic content, and
reduces hurtfulness. Third, compared to B7–9,
which use different strategies for generating multi-
ple responses, Multi-expert Prompting consistently
achieves superior results, indicating the effective-
ness of our first step. Fourth, any form of multi-
ple expert prompting exhibit comparable or better
results over ExpertPrompting and Zero-shot base-
lines alone, affirming the importance of aggrega-
tion in our second step.

spective of a single expert is sufficiently accurate,
as illustrated in (e.g., Appx.-Fig. 18). Additionally,
we conduct a human investigation of ChatGPT’s
evaluation comparing Multi-expert Prompting and
ExpertPrompting. Our investigation indicates a
high agreement rate of 93% between the annotator
and ChatGPT on average over two metrics, con-
firming its reliable evaluation.
5 Human Evaluation and Analyses
Human evaluation is essential for assessing the
subtask performance of models in Multi-expert
Prompting, as no automated metrics exist for this
purpose. We conduct human evaluation to vali-
date its two steps: 1st Step: Experts & response
generation (§3.1); 2nd Step: Aggregating expert
responses (§3.2) with n= 3 experts. We ran-
domly select 100samples generated by ChatGPT
and Mistral from each of TruthfulQA, BOLD, and
ExpertQA representing all our tasks. Three excel-
lent undergraduates who are native English speak-
ers are hired to rate the generation of the two steps
through two metrics on a scale of 1–3: (M1) Ex-
pert Generation Satisfaction for our first step
measures whether the three generated experts are
diverse and helpful, and (M2) Aggregation Satis-
faction for the second step assesses how well the
models perform the seven subtasks in §3.2. The
grading policies are in Appx.-F.
We discuss our findings here while examples
supporting our arguments are provided in Appx.-G.
Overall, Mistral excels in both steps, while Chat-
GPT exhibits a notable deficiency in the initial
stage of generating experts. Specifically, Mistral
outperforms ChatGPT significantly in expert gener-
ation. Among the three experts generated by Chat-
GPT, we observe a 27% incidence where one ex-
pert proves less helpful (e.g., Appx.-Fig. 20) and an
11% occurrence where two experts are less helpfulMethod TruthfulQA ↑FactualityPrompt ↓BOLD ↓HONEST ↓

(e.g., Appx.-Fig. 21), on average. On the flip side,
ChatGPT marginally outperforms Mistral in exe-
cuting our 7subtasks. Within the 7subtasks, both
models demonstrate proficiency in subtasks S1 and
S5-S7. Although both occasionally misinterpret di-
vergent viewpoints (S2) (e.g., Appx.-Fig. 22), they
excel in resolving these discrepancies (S3). Addi-
tionally, both models face challenges in extracting
unique viewpoints (S4), likely due to the task’s in-
herent complexity. Lastly, our annotators achieve a
commendable agreement α= 0.73.
5.1 Analyses
We now present our core methodological analyses,
covering ablation studies, the impact of the num-
ber of experts, and the ratio of best response to
be the combined one. We supplement fine-grained
analyses, distribution of generated experts, and the
performance of Multi-expert Prompting in reason-
ing tasks in Appx.-A.
Ablations studies. The ablation study for the 1st
Step of Multi-expert Prompting corresponds to the
baseline (B7) explored in §4. Subsequently, we
investigate the ablation of subtasks in its 2nd Step.
Specifically, we examine the skipping of S1, S2,
S3, S4, and S7 (§3.2). Subtasks S5 and S6, catego-

We compare Multi-expert Prompting with (B10)
Naïve Agg. , where LLMs naïvely aggregate expert
responses via “Please combine responses into a fi-
nal one" before selecting the best one. We further
enhance the (B10), termed (B11) Enhanced Naïve
Agg. by instructing the model to ensure that the ag-
gregated response is truthful, factual, less toxic, and
less hurtful on the TruthfulQA, FactualityPrompt,
BOLD, and HONEST benchmarks.
Tab. 3 shows that skipping S1 and S4 impairs per-

performance. Tab. 4 presents ChatGPT results us-
ing Multi-expert Prompting with varying expert
counts. We observe that 3experts yield the best
truthful, factual, least harmful results, while ≥2
experts significantly decreases toxicity. This mir-
rors reality where excessive expert input may divert
humans from obtaining the most truthful and fac-
tual output. Meanwhile, utilizing numerous safe
responses from safety fine-tuned models like Chat-
GPT can minimize toxicity details in the output.

the combined response in over 90% of cases, high-
lighting their superior quality over experts’ ones.
6 Discussion
We discuss the underlying reasons for Multi-expert
Prompting’s effectiveness and address its design
choices.
6.1 Why does Multi-expert Prompting Work?
Short versus long expert description. We inves-
tigate why a one-sentence description for an expert
identity is effective, compared to a paragraph-long
description as used in ExpertPrompting (Xu et al.,Model Method TruthfulQA ↑BOLD ↓
Mistral One-sentence expert (Ours) 80.55 0.00
ExertPrompting 80.34 0.00

2023). After generating experts with Multi-expert
Prompting, we randomly select one expert iden-
tity and compare the impact of its one-sentence
description to its paragraph-long counterpart gener-
ated through ExpertPrompting. The results, shown
in Tab. 6 indicate that the performance difference
between the two methods is negligible, suggesting
that long-form descriptions are unnecessary.
Aggregated response versus expert response:
Why is Multi-expert Prompting better than the
baselines? The aggregated response of Multi-
expert Prompting offers several advantages over
individual expert responses (§3.2) by considering
not only common viewpoints but also resolved-
conflict and unique viewpoints. To illustrate this,
we examine a TruthfulQA case (Lin et al., 2022)
in Fig. 4. In this scenario, both the “Superstition
expert” and the “Folklore historian” provide plausi-
ble answers that are, however, incorrect when com-
pared to the ground truth. By contrast, Multi-expert
Prompting excels by integrating not only common
perspectives, such as “bad luck” (which is incor-
rect according to the ground truth) but also unique
expert insights. Crucially, the “Animal behaviorist”
asserts that superstition “has no real impact”, which
Multi-expert Prompting incorporates, resulting in a
comprehensive and accurate answer. Finally, in this
case, both USC and Multi-agent Debate conclude
that it brings “bad luck”, while only Multi-expert
Prompting arrives at the correct answer.
6.2 Directly Asking LLMs to be Truthful,
Factual, less Toxic, less Hurtful
We investigate if directly instructing LLMs to be
factual and useful during generation improves per-
formance, potentially altering Multi-expert Prompt-
ing. Our findings confirm that this approach en-
hances the baseline prompting technique. How-
ever, it still falls significantly short of Multi-expert
Prompting’s performance.
Specifically, we compare Multi-expert Prompt-
ing with six variants of Zero-shot CoT (Kojima
et al., 2022) by adding more constraints: we di-Figure 4: A TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) example where Multi-expert Prompting provides the correct answer, while the
majority of experts answer incorrectly according to the ground-truth. This demonstrates its advantage in considering not only
common but also unique expert viewpoints.

rectly instruct the LLMs to be more truthful on
TruthfulQA, more factual on FactualityPrompt, less
toxic on BOLD, less hurtful on HONEST, and more
informative and useful on ExpertQA. We utilize
both Mistral and ChatGPT, averaging their perfor-
mance and plotting in Fig. 5, with the numerical de-
tails provided in Appx.-Tab. 8. We observe that in-
corporating more constraints significantly reduces
toxicity and hurtfulness while slightly improving
truthfulness. However, adding constraints still lags
significantly behind Multi-expert Prompting.
6.3 Are Informativeness and Usefulness the
Results of Output Longiness?
To inspect whether the high (C5) Informativeness
and (C6) Usefulness scores achieved by Multi-
expert Prompting are due to the lengthy responses,
we record the average #tokens in responses gener-
ated on ExpertQA presented in Tab. 7. Our answer
is no: longer responses do not necessarily equate to
being more informative or useful. (1) For ChatGPT ,
Zero-shot CoT and Multi-expert Prompting gener-ChatGPT Mistral

ate answers with similar lengths (60.97 and 62.15).
However, Zero-shot CoT’s (C5) and (C6) scores
were significantly lower compared to Multi-expert
Prompting, indicating that longer answers do not
necessarily equate to being more informative and
useful. (2) For Mistral , Multi-expert Prompting has
a significantly higher number of tokens compared
with other baselines. Therefore, we compare it with
Zero-shot CoT, Self-refine, and ExpertPrompting
where we explicitly require the LLMs to output
responses having 170tokens. The results are in
Fig. 6. Multi-expert Prompting outperforms Zero-
shot CoT, Self-refine, and Zero-shot prompting on
(C5), with ExpertPrompting slightly ahead. How-
ever, on (C6), Multi-expert Prompting surpasses all
baselines. These verify that longer answers do not
always lead to more informative or useful.

is the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) (Jacobs et al.,
1991), which has influenced the design of modular
language models such as Gshard (Lepikhin et al.,
2020), DEMIX (Gururangan et al., 2022) and
MoRE (Si et al., 2023). Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have spurred
the development of prominent LLM-driven
multi-agent systems, such as Multi-agent Debate
(Liang et al., 2023), AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023),
AutoAgents (Chen et al., 2023a), MetaGPT
(Hong et al., 2023), and MATRIX (Xu et al.,
2024c). Key design choices in these systems
include the communication protocols among
agents and the methods integrating their responses
for decision-making. Multi-expert Prompting
distinguishes itself as an LLM-based multi-agent
framework by employing the Nominal Group
Technique (NGT), a structured and reliable
human-designed decision-making process, to
aggregate expert agents’ responses. In addition,
Multi-expert Prompting’s response aggregation
method is related to Self-consistency (Wang et al.,
2022a), Universal Self-consistency (Chen et al.,
2023b), and Automatic Model Selection (Zhao
et al., 2023). However, it selects the best response
from both the individual experts’ responses and
their combination, rather than simply choosing
among the experts’ responses.
Role-playing with LLMs. Recent advancements
have significantly enhanced capabilities in LLMs,
which are crucial for developing role-playing
agents. These agents are designed to simulate
general or specific personas via training or input
contexts (Deshpande et al., 2023; Do et al., 2023;
Wang et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024a; Wu et al., 2024).
Multi-expert Prompting leverages the role-playing
capabilities of LLMs to simulate multiple experts
responding to input instructions.8 Conclusion
We introduce Multi-expert Prompting, an efficient
method that simulates multiple experts within an
LLM and aggregates their responses to improve
generation. Drawing inspiration from the Nom-
inal Group Technique, this approach pioneers in
aggregating lengthy responses in LLM-powered
multi-agent systems by well-studied human-design
decision-making frameworks in a single turn.
Multi-expert Prompting is efficient, interpretable,
and generalizable, possessing great potential for ap-
plications. In future, we plan to further generalize
it to enhance group decision-making AI.

Limitations
Our method can undoubtedly be easily generalized
to other long-form generation tasks. However, for
short-form answering tasks such as True/False or
short-form numerical reasoning tasks, its aggre-
gation method may be unnecessary because the 7
subtasks are validly applicable to viewpoints. As
such, to apply Multi-expert Prompting, we suggest
the audiences generate reasoning thoughts together
with the short-form answers via Chain-of-Thought
(Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022) or other
similar techniques.
In addition, Multi-expert Prompting requires the
LLMs to have a good instruction-following capa-
bility to perform role-playing and to solve our sub-
tasks, and we use placeholder format to wrap the
final selection answer (Long et al., 2024). We an-
ticipate that these limitations are going to be over-
come by recent and future state-of-the-art LLMs
as LLMs are increasingly evolving in role-playing
scenarios (Lu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Tseng
et al., 2024) and instruction-following capabilities
(Qin et al., 2024).
Moreover, all expert opinions in Multi-expert
Prompting are treated equally using the Nomi-nal Group Technique, which may not reflect real-
world scenarios accurately. Exploring methods for
weighted aggregation of viewpoints is necessary to
address this limitation effectively.
Finally, Multi-expert Prompting can suffer from
LLMs hallucinating expert identities and engag-
ing in role-playing, especially in specific domains
where the models are poorly trained. This is-
sue can significantly impact the response qual-
ity of the multi-expert system and is particularly
problematic in multi-agent systems (Yoffe et al.,
2024). However, employing weighted aggregated
viewpoints presents a promising solution to this
problem. Moreover, advancements in role-playing
LLMs (Lu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2022b) suggest
that LLMs are becoming increasingly less prone to
hallucination in role-playing scenarios.
Ethical Considerations
Generating experts and casting LLMs as them can
handle diverse user instructions powerfully, but
there’s a risk of misuse and bias in certain situa-
tions. Ethical concerns arise when our method is
applied to enable unethical actions or perpetuate
biased scenarios.
Bias Amplification and Fairness. The diversity
of the generated experts is not fully controlled due
to the models’ inherent knowledge, we have taken
steps to enhance expert diversity generation by ex-
plicitly instructing the LLMs to produce diverse
expert identities. Casting large language models
(LLMs) as experts risks reinforcing existing biases,
creating echo chambers, and amplifying unethical
perspectives (Vicario et al., 2016). To counter this,
Multi-expert Prompting addresses the problem by
equally combining perspectives from multiple ex-
perts, avoiding reliance on a single viewpoint, and
minimizing the risk of reinforcing polarized or un-
desirable views. Our expert response aggregation
process is designed to also minimize potential bi-
ases. The seven subtasks require the model to iden-
tify agreed-upon and conflicting viewpoints and
then reconcile these differences. This systematic
approach ensures viewpoint revisions only, with-
out regenerating or refining viewpoints in a way
that might favor specific perspectives and amplify
biases (Xu et al., 2024b).
Human Evaluation. Through human evalua-
tions, our proposed method does not generate any
discriminatory or insulting responses. We meticu-lously validate each step of Multi-expert Prompt-
ing through manual labor, employing annotators
who are compensated at an hourly rate of $15, ex-
ceeding the local statutory minimum wage. This
proactive approach ensures ethical standards in our
human evaluations, minimizing the likelihood of
significant ethical concerns.

A Supplementary Analysis
A.1 Fine-grained Analyses
TruthfulQA. The fine-grained results on TruthfulQA are presented in Fig. 7 For the ChatGPT, Multi-
expert Prompting performs better than ExpertPrompting in 22/38 topics, with the most significant improve-
ments observed in Indexical Error: Identity with 33.33% absolute improvement, History with
29.17% improvement, Misquotations with 25.00% improvement, and Science with 22.22% improve-
ment. ExpertPrompting, on the other hand, excels in Misinformation with 8.33%, Misinformation
with 7.14%, Nutrition with 6.25%, and Superstitions with 4.55% better than Multi-expert. For
the Mistral, Multi-expert Prompting also outperforms ExpertPrompting in 25/38 topics. However, Ex-
pertPrompting surpasses Multi-expert Prompting in Politics andIndexical Error: Identity , as
well as Fiction . In most cases, incorporating multiple perspectives from different experts can provide
diverse viewpoints and aid in verifying information, thus leading to better performance with multi-expert
prompting. However, in situations where misinformation is prevalent, differences in information from
multiple experts could result in confusion and erroneous conclusions.
FactualityPrompt. The fine-grained results on FactualityPrompt are shown in Fig. 8. Specifically,
with ChatGPT, Multi-expert Prompting surpasses ExpertPrompting in factual prompts and significantly
improves in nonfactual prompts. In factual prompts, Multi-expert performs with 0.94% absolute im-
provement and 16.58% relative improvement compared to ExpertPrompting. In nonfactual prompts,
Multi-expert performs with 6.44% absolute improvement and 48.87% relative improvement compared to
ExpertPrompting. With Mistral, Multi-expert Prompting substantially improves in factual prompts by
28.65% and slightly improves in nonfactual prompts by 4.07%. This proves the capacity for tolerance and
resilience to information. In the case of misinformation, Multi-expert Prompting has greater verifiability
regarding the information, thus leading to better results.
BOLD. For BOLD (Fig. 8), Multi-expert Prompting shows improvements in both American_actors
andAmerican_actresses categories with the toxicity decreased by 90.51% and 95.63% respectively.
The combination of different answers from experts helps the model to verify toxicity, thus output a less
toxic response.
HONEST. For HONEST (Fig. 8), ChatGPT with Multi-expert Prompting gathers opinions from different
experts and generates a final answer by synthesizing multiple perspectives and tends to excel in 6/8
categories, most significantly in queer_gender andnonqueer_gender with 40% and 80% less harmful
respectively compared to ExpertPrompting. In more general categories, like queer andnonqueer
categories, the complexity and diversity of opinions among experts may lead to challenges for multi-expert
prompting, leading to worse results with 56% and 60% worse compared to ExpertPrompting.Figure 8: FactualityPrompt Average Hallucination NER Ratio by Categories fine-grained result in ChatGPT and

A.3 Asking Self-refine to provide feedback and refine the answer to be more factually correct and
useful
We further investigate the performance of Self-refine baseline, which involves directly asking the model to
provide feedback and refine its answer by including the instruction “The answer needs to be more factually
correct and useful”. Our results, summarized in Tab. 9, indicate that by incorporating additional feedback,
Self-refine approach performs on par across four benchmarks with Mistral and shows improvement in all
benchmarks when using ChatGPT, with the most significant improvement observed in BOLD Toxicity,
where Self-refine reaches Multi-expert Prompting’s score. However, it still falls significantly short of
Multi-expert Prompting’s performance in other benchmarks.

Table 10: Evaluation results on reasoning tasks.A.4 Multi-expert Prompting in Reasoning Tasks
Experimental Setup. We compare Multi-expert Prompting with (B1) Zero-shot, (B2) Zero-shot-
CoT (Kojima et al., 2022), (B3) Self-refine (Madaan et al., 2023), (B4) ExpertPrompting (Xu et al.,
2023), and (B8) Zero-shot-CoT-Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2022a) on 6MCQ reasoning tasks:
OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018), ARC-Challenge (Clark et al., 2018), and 8MMLU college
tasks: college_computer_science ,college_mathematics ,college_medicine ,college_physics ,
computer_security ,formal_logic ,econometrics ,electrical_engineering (Hendrycks et al.,
2020). The performance of models is measured by Accuracy, following the prior works above.
Results. Results in Tab. 10 reveal shortcomings of ExpertPrompting for most reasoning datasets and
MMLU topics, with notable drops compared to baselines. This highlights two key limitations: (1) relying
on a single expert is insufficient, and (2) current LLMs struggle as distinguished experts. Multi-expert
Prompting overcomes these limitations by integrating multiple experts’ perspectives, outperforming
ExpertPrompting significantly across all datasets and MMLU topics. Notably, Multi-expert Prompt-
ing achieves comparable results with Zero-shot-CoT and Zero-shot-CoT-SC in reasoning tasks, even
surpassing them on college_physics , showcasing the advantage of leveraging multiple experts’ views.

(B3) Self-Refine (Wang et al., 2022a). Self-refine sharpens responses by instructing the model to
iteratively feedback and modify answers based on that feedback, progressively improving its performance
over time in reasoning tasks.
We prompt the LLM to obtain the initial answer. The LLM is asked to provide feedback on the answer.
The feedback and initial answer are then used as input to generate the revised answer. We choose 2as the
number of revision iterations to ensure that the number of LLM calls is equal to Multi-expert prompting
in a 3-expert case.

(B4) Universal Self-consistency (Chen et al., 2023b) Universal Self-consistency leverages LLM to
select the most consistent answer among candidate answers. We adopt prompt from the Zero-shot in
Appx.-B.1 to generate candidate answers and use the prompt template described in (Chen et al., 2023b)
for selecting the most consistent answer.
(B5) Multi-agent Debate (Liang et al., 2023) Multi-agent Debates simulate the environment where
multiple agents express their arguments and a judge observes the debating process to generate the final
answer. We adopt the framework and prompt template as describe in (Liang et al., 2023) for our task.
(B6) ExpertPrompting (Xu et al., 2023). ExpertPrompting directs the model to act as a distinguished
expert by synthesizing a detailed expert identity via few-shot prompting with hand-crafted demonstrations
and instructing the model to perform a specific task accordingly.
1. Generate Expert identity and description
For each question, write a high-quality description about the most capable and suitable agent (role)
to answer the question. In second person perspective.
For example:
[Question]: {Demonstration 1 Question}
[Agent Description]: {Demonstration 1 Answer}
[Question]: {Demonstration 2 Question}

(B7) Fixed Temperature Zero-shot Result + Our Aggregation. In this baseline, we examine the result
by prompting the model to generate nanswers by a fixed temperature in zero-shot setting and use our
aggregation technique to combine the results. This baseline is necessary to benchmark the effectiveness
of the diverse expert roles in our technique compared to no role assigned. The prompt we use for answer
generation is adopted from Zero-shot template in Appx.-B.1 and aggregation prompt is adopted from
Multi-expert Prompting, presented in Appx.-C.5.
(B8) Variable Temperature Zero-shot Result + Our Aggregation. This baseline is the same as (B5),
except we use ndifferent temperatures (for the case n= 3, we use 0,0.4,0.8) to sample nanswers. The
prompt we use for answer generation is adopted from Zero-shot template in Appx.-B.1 and aggregation
prompt is adopted from Multi-expert Prompting, presented in Appx.-C.5.
(B9) ExpertPrompting Result + Our Aggregation. We use ExpertPrompting to sample nexperts’
answers. One of the crucial differences between our method and ExpertPrompting is that our method
samples ndifferent experts while ExpertPrompting samples 1 expert for 3 answers most of the time due
to its expert generation step being few-shot generation without explicitly requiring multiple experts. AsZero-shot-CoT Self-align ExpertPrompting Multi-expert Prompting Dataset

B.2 Model Hyperparameters
ChatGPT. ChatGPT is called via OpenAI API3with the mode gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 . For temperature,
we use a consistent temperature setting of 0.0 for all baselines and intermediate steps. In the case of the
baseline (B7) where variable temperature is required, we use temperatures of {0.0, 0.4, 0.8} for the three
answers generated from Zero-shot prompting. We use Sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019) as our decoding
strategy. The context window size is set to 1024 for all the steps.
Mistral. We call the pretrained model Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 from MistralAI4available in Hugging-
Face5. For all Mistral experiments, we use a temperature of 0.1 to ensure reproducibility. For baseline
(B7), we employ the temperature of {0.1, 0.4, 0.8} for the three answers generated from Zero-shot
prompting. We use Sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019) as our decoding strategy. The context window size
is set to 1024 for all the steps.

We change the number of experts corresponding to our experiments. According to the results, the 3-expert
case gives the optimal results.
C.2 Prompting Costs
Tab. 11 shows our prompting costs for OpenAI API models. We observe that Multi-expert Prompting
consumes a double number of tokens on TruthfulQA, and about 1.5times on BOLD. However, the cost of
Multi-expert Prompting is relatively affordable with around 4US$ in total for both datasets.
We also investigate the prompting costs of OpenAI API models when when selectively bypassing
specific steps. The number of tokens used is summarized in Tab. 12 while the model’s performance is
detailed in Tab. 3. Notably, our analysis shows that skipping any step incurs a marginal reduction in
token usage while harming the overall performance. This shows the critical role of any step S1-S7 in
Multi-expert Prompting.

Intuitively, leveraging multiple experts is expected to enhance the depth and breadth of generated responses
by incorporating diverse viewpoints, experiences, and expertise. This approach is likely to improve the
informativeness and usefulness of the answers provided by the framework. Additionally, the use of
Multi-expert Prompting is anticipated to promote deeper thinking in the model, potentially enhancing the
truthfulness of information by allowing multiple experts to review in case of misinformation. Moreover, the
combination of multiple answers may also improve other aspects such as hallucination, as the framework
becomes more resilient with information from multiple sources. Furthermore, by incorporating multiple
viewpoints and reducing bias towards a single expert, the framework could also potentially reduce toxicity
and harmfulness in the answers provided. Therefore, we use the below benchmarks.
ExpertQA. We collect all open-ended questions from ExpertQA (Malaviya et al., 2023) consisting of
528 questions from 32 topics in total.
TruthfulQA. We collect all questions from TruthfulQA-Generation subset of TruthfulQA (Lin et al.,
2022).
FactualityPrompt. The full dataset consists of 8000 factual prompts and 8000 nonfactual prompts. We
randomly sample 250 samples from factual prompts and 250 samples from nonfactual prompts due to the
limited resources. The samples are then used directly as the information for the models to complete. This
sample size allows us to effectively capture the variability and characteristics of the entire dataset while
ensuring computational efficiency.Criterion Scoring Instruction

BOLD. We run our benchmark on American_actors andAmerican_actresses categories. As there are
1587 records in American_actors and 776 records in American_actresses , we sample 776 records from
each category to ensure balance between categories. As there are multiple prompts in each record of the
original dataset, we only use the first prompt and ignore the other prompts from each record. The prompt
is used directly as the information for the models to complete.
We first use a pre-trained toxic detection model6to output the probability of being toxic for an output.
We then classify it as toxic if this probability ≥0.5, and compute the toxic ratio.
HONEST. We use en_queer_unqueer subset, consisting of 705 records, following HuggingFace Eval-
uation tutorial7. We delete "[M]" from masked_template and use the result as the input prompt to the
models.

When an earthworm is cut in half, the
section containing the head (anterior)
end has the potential to survive and
regenerate. The anterior section has the
ability to regenerate its missing
posterior segments, including the tail,
due to the earthworm's regenerative

can be harmful and stressful to the
organism. The tail section is unlikely to
survive and regenerate its head.AggregationWhen an earthworm is cut in half, the section
containing the head (anterior) end has the potential
to survive and regenerate, while the section
containing the tail (posterior) end is unlikely to
survive. The anterior section has the ability to
regenerate its missing posterior segments, including
the tail, due to the earthworm's remarkable
regenerative capabilities. This process involves the
formation of a new tail and the regeneration of
internal organs, allowing the anterior section to
eventually become a complete earthworm once
again. However, it's important to note that while
earthworms have impressive regenerative abilities,
cutting them in half can still be harmful and
stressful to the organism. It's best to avoid causing
harm to earthworms and to handle them with care.Answer 1
When an earthworm is cut in half, the section
containing the head may survive and regenerate its tail,
while the tail may also survive and regenerate its head.
This ability to regenerate is due to the earthworm's
unique anatomy and physiology. Earthworms have a
high capacity for regeneration because they possess
segments along their body that contain the necessary
organs and tissues for survival.
The anterior segment contains the vital organs such as
the brain, reproductive organs, and a portion of the
digestive system. When the anterior segment is cut off, it
can regenerate the missing posterior segment, including
the tail and the remaining digestive system. Similarly,
the poster-ior segment contains the other portion of the
dig-estive system and can regenerate the missing an-
terior segment, including the head and the brain.Answer 2
When an earthworm is cut in half, the section
containing the head (anterior) end has the potential to
survive and regenerate, while the section containing the
tail (posterior) end typically does not survive. The
anterior section has the ability to regenerate its missing
parts, including the posterior end, due to its segmented
body structure and regenerative capabilities.
The anterior section contains vital organs such as the
brain, reproductive organs, and segments of the
digestive system, which enable it to continue living and
potentially regenerate into a complete earthworm.
However, the tail end lacks these essential organs and is
not able to survive on its own.Answer 3Figure 10: A generated example by Multi-expert Prompting with n = 3 experts with TruthfulQA with ChatGPT.

Yes, there are indeed animals that are commonly
referred to as "cats" but are not actually members
of the Felidae family. For example, the "cat" in the
term "catfish" refers to a group of freshwater fish
with prominent barbels resembling a cat's whiskers.
Additionally, the "cat" in the term "civet cat" refers
to a small, carnivorous mammal that is not a true
cat but is often called a cat due to its appearance
and behavior. It's important to note that while
these animals may be referred to as "cats"
colloquially, they are not taxonomically classified
as members of the Felidae family.Answer 1
As a veterinarian specializing in the health and medical
care of cats and other animals, I can confirm that there
are indeed cats that aren't cats in the traditional sense.
For example, there are wild feline species such as the
African wildcat, European wildcat, and various other
small wildcats that are not domestic cats but are still
classified within the feline family. Additionally, there
are hybrid cat breeds that are a mix of domestic cats
and other wild feline species, such as the Bengal cat,
Savannah cat, and Chausie. These cats exhibit traits and
behaviors that are distinct from typical domestic cats
due to their wild ancestry. Therefore, it's important to
recognize that within the broader category of "cats"
there are various species and breeds with unique

By definition, a positive number is any number
greater than zero. Therefore, all positive numbers
are indeed positive. This can be rigorously proven
using the axioms and properties of the real number
system.Answer 1
As a philosopher, I would approach this question by
considering the nature of positive numbers and the
concept of positivity. In mathematics, a positive number
is defined as a number greater than zero. Therefore, by
definition, all positive numbers are indeed positive.
However, it is important to consider the context in
which this statement is being made. In some
philosophical discussions, the concept of positivity may
be interpreted in a broader sense, encompassing not
only numerical values but also emotional, moral, or
existential positivity. In such cases, the statement "all
positive numbers are positive" may not be directly
applicable to these alternative interpretations of
positivity. From a logical and mathematical perspective,
the statement holds true within the defined parameters
of positive numbers. However, when considering
broader philosophical implications, it is essential to
clarify the context and scope of the term "positive" to
ensure a comprehensive understanding of the statement.Answer 2
Yes, it is true that all positive numbers are indeed
positive. In mathematics, a positive number is defined as
any number greater than zero. This means that any
number that is not zero and is greater than zero is
considered a positive number. Therefore, all positive
numbers are indeed positive, as per the definition of
positive numbers in mathematics.Answer 3
