Abstract
After large models (LMs) have gained
widespread acceptance in code-related tasks,
their superior generative capacity has greatly
promoted the application of the code LM. Nev-
ertheless, the security of the generated code has
raised attention to its potential damage. Ex-
isting secure code generation methods have
limited generalizability to unseen test cases
and poor robustness against the attacked model,
leading to safety failures in code generation. In
this paper, we propose a generalizable and ro-
bust secure code generation method SecCoder
by using in-context learning (ICL) and the safe
demonstration. The dense retriever is also used
to select the most helpful demonstration to max-
imize the improvement of the generated code’s
security. Experimental results show the supe-
rior generalizability of the proposed model Sec-
Coder compared to the current secure code gen-
eration method, achieving a significant security
improvement of an average of 7.20% on un-
seen test cases. The results also show the better
robustness of SecCoder compared to the cur-
rent attacked code LM, achieving a significant
security improvement of an average of 7.74%.
Our analysis indicates that SecCoder enhances
the security of LMs in generating code, and it
is more generalizable and robust.
1 Introduction
After large models (LMs) (Radford et al., 2019;
Vaswani et al., 2017) achieved significant success,
it has promoted the development of many code-
related works such as code summarization (Parvez
et al., 2021; Ahmed and Devanbu, 2022), code re-
pair (Xia et al., 2023; Pearce et al., 2023), code gen-
eration (Nijkamp et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021).
Nevertheless, the widespread use of LMs in code-
related tasks has raised significant safety concerns.
Hammond et al. (2022) investigated the security of
the code generated by GitHub Copilot (Dohmke,

2023) and found that about 40% are vulnerable.
Siddiq and Santos (2022) presented a manually cu-
rated dataset for code security evaluation. About
90% of the code snippets generated by the LMs
are vulnerable when manual inspection is used to
check for security. The vulnerability poses a signif-
icant obstacle to code LMs’ application in security-
sensitive domains. To mitigate the vulnerabilities,
the method of secure code generation has attracted
increasing attention. Figure 1 illustrates the secure
code generation from Common Weakness Enumer-
ation (CWE) (MITRE, 2023) serves as a broadly
accepted category system for vulnerabilities.1
Thus far, extensive research has been conducted
on enhancing the security of LMs (Ji et al., 2024;
Achiam et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023). Given the
differences in security policies between the natural
language processing (NLP) and the code, some safe
alignment methods are specifically designed for
code LMs (He and Vechev, 2023). Unfortunately,
two crucial features of the secure code generation
method have been ignored, which would severely
compromise safety in practical applications.
The first is the generalizability to the unseen test
cases. Qi et al. (2023) proved that simply fine-
tuning can inadvertently degrade the safety of LMs
even without malicious intent. Wei et al. (2024)
1https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.
htmlarXiv:2410.01488v1  [cs.PL]  2 Oct 2024proposed that mismatched generalization is one of
the critical failure modes of safety alignment. It
occurs when safety training does not generalize to
a domain for which capabilities exist. Compared
to NLP, mismatched generalization is more preva-
lent in code generation since there are many kinds
of vulnerabilities in code. For instance, the CWE
(MITRE, 2023) has over 600 categories of vulner-
abilities. The limited number of vulnerabilities in
the secure code generation training dataset may
lead to mismatched generalization in application
(He and Vechev, 2023). Therefore, the lack of
generalizability could cause safety failures, which
limits the application of the secure code generation
method.
The second is the robustness against the attacked
model. There are many well-designed attacks on
LMs (Schuster et al., 2021; Perez et al., 2022; He
and Vechev, 2023). The experiments in He and
Vechev (2023) showed that their attack could not
be easily defended using simple prompt perturba-
tions without external knowledge. This indicates
that the basic input preprocessing defenses are not
robust against the attack. Therefore, a more pow-
erful secure code generation method that is robust
against such attacks is needed to generate more
secure code in real-world applications.
To address the above challenges, in this work,
we propose SecCoder, a generalizable and robust
secure code generation approach. Specifically, Sec-
Coder guides LMs to adapt swiftly to unseen test
cases with the demonstration by leveraging the
power of in-context learning (ICL) (Dong et al.,
2022; Min et al., 2021; Iyer et al., 2022; Wei et al.,
2021; Gu et al., 2023) ability. Additionally, Sec-
Coder enhances the robustness of secure code gen-
eration by providing an extra security codebase
separately from the attacked model to guarantee
the safe of the demonstration. SecCoder retrieves
the most helpful safe demonstration by using the re-
trieval capacity of the LMs to maximize SecCoder’s
effectiveness.
We employ several kinds of code LMs on a
broad range of common vulnerabilities in the CWE
(MITRE, 2023) to validate SecCoder’s generaliz-
ability and robustness. First, when evaluating the
proposed model SecCoder on the unseen test cases,
the12.07% average increase in the security reveals
SecCoder’s generalizability. Second, SecCoder is
more secure on unseen test cases than the state-of-
the-art secure code generation method SVEN sec
(He and Vechev, 2023) and the improvement ofthe security is 7.20% on average, which reveals the
generalizability of SecCoder is better than the exist-
ing method. Last, the security of the attacked code
LM is increased by 7.74% on average by using Sec-
Coder, which reveals the robustness of SecCoder.
These results clearly demonstrate the power of Sec-
Coder.
We also verify the functional correctness of Sec-
Coder since it is supposed to preserve the original
LM’s usefulness. We found that the functional
correctness of SecCoder is almost the same as the
original LM despite not adopting any specific mech-
anisms to preserve the utility. It is a clear contrast to
the existing method (He and Vechev, 2023), which
carefully designed the mechanism to preserve the
utility and paid a heavy price for the trade-off be-
tween the utility and the security. Our finding could
inspire other researchers to find a more efficient and
straightforward mechanism to preserve the utility
of the LM during security hardening.
Our Contributions. Our main contributions can
be summarized as follows:
•We identify the primary limitations of the ap-
plication of secure code generation methods:
the generalizability to unseen test cases and
the robustness against the attacked model.
•We propose SecCoder that is a generalizable
and robust secure generation method, which
could preserve the utility without additional
efforts and resources.
•Experiments show the effectiveness of Sec-
Coder in enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of secure code generation. Sec-
Coder’s generalizability outperforms the ex-
isting secure code generation method, and Sec-
Coder is robust against the existing attacked
code LM.
2 Related Work
Security Risks of Code LMs. Recent advances in
pre-training technologies have facilitated the emer-
gence of large-scale, pre-trained language models
specifically tailored for code-related tasks, such as
CodeX (Chen et al., 2021), codeT5 (Wang et al.,
2021), CodeGen (Nijkamp et al., 2022). Because
the training dataset collected from open-source
repositories like GitHub may include insecure code,
the security of the code generated by LMs has
raised serious concerns. Hammond et al. (2022)
evaluated the security in GitHub Copilot and foundthat roughly 40% of the codes generated by it are
insecure. Inspired by this, He and Vechev (2023)
proposed SVEN to control the security of the gen-
erated code according to a binary property. Never-
theless, the security improvement reduces by 25%
when evaluating CodeGen-2.7B on the unseen test
case, which indicates that the generalizability of
SVEN is limited. The effectiveness of SVEN also
implies that the existing LMs are fragile in code
security because they could generate more vulnera-
bilities by using SVEN vul.
In-Context Learning. As model sizes and cor-
pus sizes have expanded (Chowdhery et al., 2023;
Brown et al., 2020; Devlin et al., 2018), LMs have
exhibited the powerful ICL ability, the capability
to learn a new task from a handful of contextual
examples. Extensive research has demonstrated
that LMs can accomplish many complicated tasks
via ICL (Wei et al., 2022). In contrast to supervised
training, ICL represents a training-free learning
paradigm. This approach significantly decreases
computational expenses associated with adjusting
the model to novel tasks. Therefore, ICL is benefi-
cial for the generalizability.
Retriever. The retriever has attracted significant
concerns recently (Guu et al., 2020; Karpukhin
et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2023; Borgeaud et al.,
2022; Asai et al., 2023) since it could assist people
to retrieve the desired item automatically. There are
two kinds of retrievers. One is the sparse retriever,
such as BM25 (Robertson et al., 2009), which uses
lexical matching, and the other is the dense re-
triever, which uses semantic matching. With the
development of pre-trained models, there are in-
creasingly off-the-shelf dense retrievers, such as
INSTRUCTOR (Su et al., 2022). INSTRUCTOR
is fine-tuned to efficiently adapt to diverse down-
stream tasks without additional training by jointly
embedding the inputs and the task. Several code-
related tasks adopt retriever such as code auto-
completion (Hashimoto et al., 2018), code sum-
marization (Parvez et al., 2021), and code gener-
ation (Parvez et al., 2021). Nevertheless, there is
no widely agreed criterion for selecting a perfect
demonstration. The existing research on retrieval
strategies for secure code generation is still limited.
3 Methodology
3.1 Overview
In this section, we describe the proposed method
in detail. As Figure 2 depicts, we introduce Sec-Coder, a novel method to enhance the generaliz-
ability and the robustness of the secure code gen-
eration method. It consists of four stages, each
involving a different role of enhanced code secu-
rity. Leveraging the LM’s capabilities, SecCoder is
more generalizable and robust than the prior work.
3.2 Problem Formulation
Our ultimate goal is to generate a more secure code
yvia:
y= arg max
ykLM(yk|x), (1)
where xis one of the prompts used to guide LMs to
generate desired codes, consisting of an incomplete
program and a functional description. ykindicates
all possible results of y. Our approach is to opti-
mize the process based on the following steps.
3.3 Step 1: Expansion
First, in order to improve the robustness, when
a new vulnerability is found, fix and add it
to the secure code database Swhich contains
a large collection of previous secure codes
{s1, s2,···, sj,···, sm}, where sjdenotes the j-
th previous secure code and mis the number of
secure codes. The secure code database would be
expanded to S={s1, s2,···, sj,···, sm, sm+1}.
The codes in the codebase are all secure to guar-
antee the security of the retrieved demonstration,
which could improve the robustness of the pro-
posed SecCoder. The secure code could be col-
lected from open-source platforms like GitHub or
local projects. The latter method may be safer and
more practical because it could resist malicious
code on the open-source platform and avoid out-of-
distribution problems.
3.4 Step 2: Demonstration Selection
Second, relying on the retrieval capability of the
LM, we use the pre-trained embedding LM as the
retriever to select the most helpful demonstration.
Given a prompt x, a dense retriever fetches the most
relevant secure code sjin the codebase Saccord-
ing to the relevance scoring function fϕ(x, sj)pa-
rameterized by ϕ. Specifically, the dense retriever
encodes the prompt and the codes in the secure
codebase into continuous vectors. Next, calculate
their similarities and select the secure code that
has the maximum similarity with the prompt. We
choose cosine similarity since the critical character
of the semantic is the direction of the vector insteadInput Prompt

of the length. Therefore, cosine distance is perfect
for measuring the distance of embeddings.
3.5 Step 3: Integration
Third, leveraging the in-context learning capability
of LMs improves the generalizability of SecCoder.
We show a demonstration to the LM and encourage
the LM to generate more secure codes. The original
input prompt xis augmented with the retrieved
secure code sjto form a new input prompt ˆx=x⊕
sj, where ⊕denotes the concatenation operation.
The integration template is presented in Appendix
A. The new input prompt would be sent to the code
LMs.
3.6 Step 4: Secure Code Generation
Last, the new input prompt ˆxwould be used to
generate the more secure code using the code LM.
We model the output of the code LM as a sequence
of tokens i.e.,y, which is supposed to be the more
secure code that is generated according to the input
ˆx:
y= arg max
ykLM(yk|ˆx), (2)

Coder.

secure codes used by SecCoder, and the evalua-
tion dataset used to evaluate the security of various
secure code generation methods.
Training Dataset. There are two training
datasets required when training the baseline meth-
ods. One is used to train the state-of-the-art secure
code generation method, and the other is used to
train the state-of-the-art attacked code LM. Thefirst dataset is constructed from Fan et al. (2020),
and each data is labeled with a CWE tag. We use
the dataset in Fan et al. (2020) as the base dataset
and remove the data whose CWE tag is the same
as the data in the evaluation dataset to observe
the generalizability of SecCoder. Then, following
our baseline SVEN sec(He and Vechev, 2023), we
randomly select 723 pairs of data from the rest.
Second, we directly adopt the training dataset in
He and Vechev (2023) when training the attacked
code LM to observe the robustness of the proposed
method SecCoder.
Demonstration Dataset. We construct two
demonstration datasets from the existing datasets
collected from GitHub to cover a broader range
of vulnerabilities and real-world projects. Each
program in the two demonstration datasets is a
function written in C/C++ or Python and related
to a CWE that existed in the evaluation dataset.
The first is constructed from the training dataset
in He and Vechev (2023) and used to observe
the generalizability of SecCoder. The second is
constructed from the validation dataset in He and
Vechev (2023), which is used to evaluate the ro-
bustness of SecCoder on the attacked LM. The
training dataset of the attacked LM and the evalua-
tion dataset have the same CWE tags, but they have
different secure codes. It simulates the situation
in that the user is unaware of which data are used
to attack the model. Deleting the secure programs
according to the max context length, we get 596
secure codes in the first demonstration dataset and
63 secure codes in the second.
Evaluation Dataset. To evaluate SecCoder, we
use the evaluation dataset from He and Vechev
(2023). Each evaluation data consists of an incom-
plete code snippet and a functional description. It
has a CWE tag to identify the type of vulnerabil-
ity that is prone to be produced when generating
the code according to this evaluation data. The
evaluation dataset covers 9 CWEs. This evalua-
tion dataset is also used in Hammond et al. (2022)
and Siddiq and Santos (2022), which proved that
automatically measuring their security by using
CodeQL (Cod, 2023) is possible.
4.1.2 Models
There are two kinds of models in SecCoder, i.e.,
the code LM and the retriever.
Code LMs. We use CodeGen (Nijkamp et al.,
2022) with different sizes (350M, 2.7B, 6.1B),
multi-head attention version SantaCoder (1.3B)(Allal et al., 2023), and InCoder (6.7B) (Fried et al.,
2022).
Retrievers. The dense retriever used in Sec-
Coder is INSTRUCTOR (Su et al., 2022). We use
INSTRUCTOR of two sizes in the experiments.
Therefore, the suffix is used to distinguish the ver-
sion of INSTRUCTOR. We use INSTRUCTOR-
xl in SecCoder-xl and INSTRUCTOR-large in
SecCoder-large.
4.1.3 Baselines
The "None" method refers to the original code LM
that does not employ any security mechanisms. To
validate the generalizability of SecCoder, we com-
pare it with the state-of-the-art method SVEN sec
(He and Vechev, 2023). To validate the robust-
ness of SecCoder, the adversarial testing method
SVEN vul(He and Vechev, 2023) is used to attack
the code LMs to reduce the security of the origi-
nal LMs. Then, we observe whether the proposed
method SecCoder could be robust against the at-
tacked model. In the ablation study, we also com-
pare SecCoder with different retrieval strategies,
such as random strategy and sparse retriever. BM25
(Robertson et al., 2009) is selected as the sparse
retriever.
4.1.4 Metrics
Security Evaluation. We sample 25 completions
and filter out the duplicates or the codes that have
errors while compiling or parsing. The result is a
set of valid codes, which are checked for security
using a GitHub CodeQL (Cod, 2023). We use the
percentage of secure codes among valid codes as
the security rate.
Functional Correctness Evaluation. Hu-
manEval benchmark (Chen et al., 2021) is used
for evaluating functional correctness. Pass @kis
calculated to measure the functional correctness of
the code LMs.
4.1.5 Implementation Details
The temperature of all LMs in the experiments
is 0.4. We retrieve one demonstration in all ex-
periments in this paper. Following He and Vechev
(2023), we also exclude three C/C++ CWEs: CWE-
476, CWE-416, and CWE-190, when evaluating
the security of SantaCoder and Incoder, since they
are not sufficiently trained for C/C++. We repeat
each experiment 3 times with distinct seeds and
report the average security rate. We use Intel Xeon
Platinum 8352Y and A800 in all experiments.350M 2.7B 6.1B5060708090100

4.2 Main Results
As mentioned previously, we evaluate the security
rate of SecCoder-xl to validate its generalizability
and robustness. We also evaluate its functional
correctness to show that SecCoder-xl preserves the
utility. This section presents the results of the main
experiments on them.
4.2.1 Security
Generalizability. First, we prove that SecCoder
has a better generalizability than SVEN sec(He and
Vechev, 2023) on the original CodeGen. Addi-
tionally, we also perform SecCoder on the secure
CodeGen obtained by using SVEN secto further
enhance the generalizability of the existing secure
code generation method. The results are shown on
the left in Figure 3. The improvement on the origi-
nal CodeGen by using SecCoder-xl is more signifi-
cant than using SVEN sec, suggesting SecCoder-xl
only uses one demonstration yet still achieves better
performance. The security rate is further improved
when using the proposed method SecCoder-xl on
secure CodeGen trained by the approach SVEN sec.
This finding demonstrates that our method is not
incompatible with others, and they could be used
simultaneously to further improve the security of
the generated code. SecCoder-xl consistently has
a strong advantage in generating secure code over
all three model sizes.
Robustness. Second, we evaluate the robustness
of the proposed method SecCoder-xl on attacked
CodeGen. The SecCoder-xl not only could im-
prove the security of original and secure LMs but
also have a defense effect on the attacked LMs. We
evaluate the robustness by conducting experiments
on the attacked model, which is trained by the ap-
proach SVEN vul(He and Vechev, 2023). The re-
sults are shown in Table 1. We observe that the
approach SVEN vulcould reduce the security byModel SizeMethod

using prefix learning and the SecCoder-xl could
recover some security on attacked model SVEN vul.
It proves that SecCoder-xl is robust.
4.2.2 Functional Correctness
In Figure 4, we summarize the pass @kscores of the
original CodeGen and SecCoder-xl with various
sizes on the HumanEval benchmark. The results
show that most of the functional correctness is pre-
served. Slight reductions are observed in some
cases, and these insignificant reductions are accept-
able in practical application, especially considering
that security is effectively improved.
5 Analysis
5.1 Applicability to Different LMs
Security. In this section, we present the security
rates of InCoder and SantaCoder to investigate
SecCoder-xl applicability beyond CodeGen. Our
major findings are:
•Generalizability. The results are shown in
Figure 3. The improvement of security of
SecCoder-xl on the original SantaCoder is
also more significant than the state-of-the-
art secure code generation method SVEN sec.
It proves that SecCoder-xl is generalizable
on different LMs. Although the improve-
ment of security of SecCoder-xl on the orig-
inal Incoder is slightly lower than SVEN sec,
the security rate is still improved after us-
ing the proposed method SecCoder-xl on se-
cure code LMs trained by SVEN sec, suggest-
ing SecCoder-xl could enhance the generaliz-
ability of the existed secure code generation
method.
•Robustness. The results are shown in Table 2.
As with CodeGen model, we observed a sim-
ilar trend for SantaCoder and InCoder. The
proposed method SecCoder-xl is robust when
it meets the attacked model.0 25 50 75 100

above observation that most of the functional cor-
rectness is preserved.
5.2 Ablation Study
SecCoder-xl has two key parts: ICL and retriever.
In this section, we study the contribution of differ-
ent parts to the overall effectiveness.
ICL. First, we perform an ablation study to re-
move the demonstration to observe the impact of
ICL on SecCoder-xl’s generalizability. The two
variants are: (i) None – This method indicates
the original models that no demonstration is con-
catenated with the prompt; and (ii) SecCoder-xl –MethodModel

As shown in Table 3, CodeGen with the None
method shows a security rate of about 60%, which
is consistent with other LMs (Hammond et al.,

sistently has a significant security improvement on

of the security rate on InCoder is not as significant
as CodeGen and SantaCoder. Even so, SecCoder-

Retriever. Second, the quality of the retrieved
demonstration is one of the influencing factors for
SecCoder-xl’s performance, and it depends largely
on the retrieval strategies. Therefore, we com-
pare the security rates of different retrieval strate-
gies, such as random strategy, sparse retriever, and
SecCoder-xl, on CodeGen to observe the impact of
the retriever on the generalizability. The results are
shown in Table 4. The effectiveness of the random0 200 400 600

method is inconsistent. It improves the security on
350M and 6.1B, but slightly reduces the security on
2.7B. Although BM25 enhances security across all
three model sizes, its effectiveness is diminished
when the model size is 6.1B, as opposed to the
random strategy. It contradicts the code repair task
(Wang et al., 2023) which shows BM25 achieves
more significant results than the random method.
Compared with other methods, SecCoder-xl con-
sistently has a strong advantage in generating the
secure code over all three model sizes.
5.3 Retriever Comparison
In this section, we evaluate the retrieval accuracy to
analyze why the proposed method SecCoder-xl is
better than BM25. Every data in the evaluation and
the demonstration datasets has a CWE tag. We intu-
itively feel that the retrieved demonstration would
help the prompt generate a more secure code when
their CWE tags are identical.
We calculate the accuracy: the percentage of
the demonstrations with the same CWE as the
prompt among retrieved demonstrations. The result
is shown on the left of Figure 6. SecCoder-xl could
retrieve more relevant demonstrations. Then, we
calculate how many demonstrations are required
to retrieve so that there is at least one whose CWE
is the same as the prompt. The average minimum
demonstration number is shown on the right of Fig-
ure 6. It shows that BM25 needs 6.06 retrieved
demonstrations on average. In contrast, SecCoder-
xl only needs 5.17 on average. Most of the time, the
context length is limited. Therefore, SecCoder-xl
is more beneficial to secure code generation. Most
of the time, the context length is limited. There-
fore, SecCoder-xl is more beneficial to secure code
generation.MethodModel Size

ent sizes of SecCoder. The best result is highlighted.
5.4 Impact of Model Size
In this section, we explore how scaling model size
can facilitate more powerful pattern inference for
secure code generation.
Recall that there are two kinds of pre-trained
models in SecCoder, code LMs and retriever. We
compare the security rate on different sizes of dense
retrievers and different sizes of code LMs used
in SecCoder. The method SecCoder-large and
SecCoder-xl use INSTRUCTOR-large (335M) and
INSTRUCTOR-xl (1.5B) (Su et al., 2022) as the
retriever separately. CodeGen with different model
sizes: 350M, 2.7B, 6.1B are used as the base model.
The results are shown in Table 5. The more parame-
ters the SecCoder has, the higher the security rate is.
Compared to the method with fewer parameters in
this table, the method that uses INSTRUCTOR-
xl and CodeGen-6.1B simultaneously improves
7.63% and exhibits the best performance which
has been highlighted in the table 5. It shows that
more parameters could improve more security of
the generated code.
6 Discussions
As shown in the experiments, the proposed method
SecCoder is beneficial to the security of code LMs,
and it is generalizable and robust. Compared to
the existing method, it doesn’t need to be retrained
when meeting new vulnerabilities. The existing
method SVEN (He and Vechev, 2023) needs to
specially distinguish the security and function re-
gions to preserve the functional correctness of the
code LMs, and it doesn’t mention how to solve the
particular case that the entire program is security-
sensitive. Nevertheless, SecCoder could preserve
the correctness without any extra operation. There-
fore, SecCoder has a broader range of applications.
In addition, SecCoder can be combined with other
security hardening methods to further improve the
security of code LMs. It is worth investigating in
the future.7 Conclusion
In this paper, we highlight the limitation of the
generalizability to unseen test cases and the robust-
ness against the attacked code LMs on the applica-
tion of the existing secure code generation method.
We introduce the method SecCoder to enhance the
security of code generated by various LMs. By
leveraging the capacity of the pre-trained dense re-
triever to retrieve the relevant secure code as the
safe demonstration and the ability of ICL to incor-
porate the new vulnerability fix pattern, SecCoder
exhibits remarkable generalizability and robustness
in secure code generation. Interestingly, the utility
has been preserved without additional effort, which
is also a distinct advantage compared to existing
secure code generation method. Our extensive eval-
uation demonstrates the generalizability and the
robustness of SecCoder over various kinds and sev-
eral sizes of code LMs. Moreover, SecCoder could
be used with other secure code generation methods
to further enhance the generalizability.
Limitations
Our work has limitations in certain aspects, such
as the context length limit, the trade-off between
security and functional correctness, and the limited
resources of the secure code generation datasets
and methods. First, the context length limits the
number of the retrieved demonstration. SecCoder
has been beneficial from the retrieved demonstra-
tions. The more retrieved demonstrations may bet-
ter promote the security of the generated code. It is
worth investigating how to concatenate more exter-
nal knowledge to the LM. In future work, we plan
to explore how to effectively fuse more demonstra-
tions into input to break the context length limi-
tation and further improve the security of gener-
ated code. Second, although the trade-off between
the security and the functional correctness in the
method SecCoder has no severe impact on the prac-
tical application, excelling at both functional cor-
rectness and security could be a promising future
work. Last, there are limited secure code genera-
tion methods and datasets. Therefore, this prevents
us from conducting experiments using abundant
methods and data. The benchmark for secure code
generation is worth investigating in the future.
Ethics Statement
We have discussed the limitations of our work. We
use the existing datasets in He and Vechev (2023)and Fan et al. (2020), and the pre-trained model,
such as CodeGen (Nijkamp et al., 2022), Santa-
Coder (Allal et al., 2023), InCoder (Fried et al.,
2022) and INSTRUCTOR (Su et al., 2022) which
are publicly available and the licenses of them were
rigorously vetted. Their use is consistent with their
intended use. Since the proposed method is used to
generate the secure code, there are very few risks
and biases associated with our data and method,
and it doesn’t require ethical consideration.

B Further Experimental Results and
Details
Evaluation for More Baselines. SafeCoder (He
et al., 2024) is another state-of-the-art secure code
generation method that promotes a joint optimiza-
tion of security and utility by fine-tuning the LM us-
ing a specific vulnerability dataset. This approach
requires more computing resources than SVEN (He
and Vechev, 2023) and SecCoder, making it more
challenging to adapt to new vulnerabilities. We
compare SafeCoder and SecCoder to offer a more
comprehensive perspective on SecCoder’s gener-
alizability. The results are presented in Table 6,
showing that SecCoder’s generalizability outper-
forms the state-of-the-art method, SafeCoder.
Breakdown Security Results. As shown in Fig-
ure 3, CodeGen-6.1B is more secure than the other
two sizes of CodeGen. Nevertheless, the proposedmethod SecCoder-xl can still further improve the
security of the code LMs. Therefore, we present
the breakdown results on CodeGen-6.1B to observe
the effectiveness of the proposed model SecCoder-
xl in detail in Table 9.
C Edge Case Identification
We calculate the improvement in security rate sep-
arately for different languages based on the break-
down security results shown in Table 9 and found
that SecCoder has limitations in C++. Compared
to the original code LM without any security mech-
anism, SecCoder has achieved a security improve-
ment of 14.99% on unseen test cases in Python.
However, it only achieves 6.14% in C++, which
is roughly half the improvement in Python. This
suggests that enhancing the generalizability of se-
cure code generation in C++ is a potential area for
improvement.
D Use Cases
D.1 Examples of Generated Code
We present a successful case of SecCoder-xl to
illustrate its practical application. As shown in
Figure 7, the code LM learns from the demonstra-
tion that it can use safe_join to avoid CWE-022
when generating secure code. The blue part is the
security-sensitive region in the retrieved demonstra-
tion. The green part is the security-sensitive region
in the generated code.
D.2 Examples of Retrieved Demonstrations
We present some successful use cases of the re-
trieved demonstrations using the proposed method
SecCoder-xl. The blue part is the functional de-
scription, and the green part is the security-sensitive
region in the retrieved demonstration.
Example I : As shown in Figure 10, the left is
the prompt of CWE-089. The right is the demon-
stration retrieved by the CWE-089 prompt, which
shows how to generate the secure code without
CWE-089.
Example II : As shown in Figure 11, the left is
the prompt of CWE-022. The right is the demon-
stration retrieved by the CWE-022 prompt, which
shows how to generate the secure code without
CWE-022.
Example III : As shown in Figure 12, the left is
the prompt of CWE-190. The right is the demon-
stration retrieved by the CWE-190 prompt, which
shows how to generate the secure code without
CWE-190.Prompt Generated Code
