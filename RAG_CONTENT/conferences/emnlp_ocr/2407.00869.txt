Abstract
We find that language models have difficul-
ties generating fallacious and deceptive rea-
soning. When asked to generate deceptive
outputs, language models tend to leak hon-
est counterparts but believe them to be false.
Exploiting this deficiency, we propose a jail-
break attack method that elicits an aligned
language model for malicious output. Specif-
ically, we query the model to generate a fal-
lacious yet deceptively real procedure for the
harmful behavior. Since a fallacious proce-
dure is generally considered fake and thus
harmless by LLMs, it helps bypass the safe-
guard mechanism. Yet the output is factually
harmful since the LLM cannot fabricate falla-
cious solutions but proposes truthful ones.
We evaluate our approach over five safety-
aligned large language models, comparing
four previous jailbreak methods, and show
that our approach achieves competitive per-
formance with more harmful outputs. We be-
lieve the findings could be extended beyond
model safety, such as self-verification and hal-
lucination.
1 Introduction
It is arguably easier, at least from the logical per-
spective, to tell the truth than to tell a lie. For ex-
ample, given a math problem “What is 1/2 + 1/3” ,
telling the truth only requires the ability to per-
form the correct reasoning and derive the correct
answer. Telling a lie, on the other hand, requires
the ability to not only discern the correct answers,
but also avoid generating the correct answers and,
more importantly, make the wrong answers look
real. In this paper, we refer to the task of fabricat-
ing incorrect yet seemingly plausible reasoning
asfallacious reasoning .
Large language models (LLMs) have long been
struggling with reasoning problems. Existing re-
search revealed that LLMs have difficulty discern-
ing the veracity of their intrinsic answers (Huang

et al., 2024; Kadavath et al., 2022; Stechly et al.,
2023). This raises an intriguing research ques-
tion: If LLMs already find it hard to validate their
own correctness, can LLMs deliberately generate
fallacious reasoning upon request?
This paper starts with a pilot investigation of
LLMs’ ability to perform fallacious reasoning.
Specifically, on four reasoning benchmarks, cov-
ering the domains of mathematics, logic, and
commonsense, we ask the LLM to generate the
correct answers and to deliberately generate
wrong answers that are deceptively real. Our sur-
prising finding is that, for all of our tested bench-
marks, the accuracy of the generated wrong an-
swers is almost as high as that of the correct ones.
For instance, in Figure 3, the LLM generates the
correct reasoning chain and final answer despite
the fallacious generation request and claims a
step to be wrong with a contradictory statement.
This pilot study reveals that LLMs might be un-
able to intentionally generate deceptive reason-
ing and instead often leak the correct solutions in
what they claim to be wrong answers.
As we further our investigation, this seeminglyarXiv:2407.00869v2  [cs.CL]  23 Sep 2024small glitch in LLMs can lead to a significant se-
curity threat. Specifically, we discovered a simple
yet effective jailbreak attack, which we call the fal-
lacy failure attack (FFA) , that can elicit harmful
output from LLMs by exploiting the LLMs’ defi-
ciency in fallacious reasoning. Given a malicious
query, e.g. “How to create and spread a virus” , FFA
queries the target LLM to generate a fallacious
yet deceptively real procedure for the malicious
query, as demonstrated in Figure 1. The rationale
behind FFA is two-fold: (1) While LLMs generally
reject malicious queries as they are harmful, they
would consider a query asking for a fallacious an-
swer harmless since it purportedly does not seek
a truthful (and harmful) answer. This can poten-
tially help to bypass the LLMs’ safeguard mecha-
nisms; (2) LLMs would generally leak a truthful
answer even when asked to generate a fallacious
one. Therefore, by asking the LLM to generate
fake answers to a malicious query, we can both
bypass the security mechanism and obtain a fac-
tual and harmful response. Based on the ratio-
nales above, FFA crafts a jailbreak prompt with
four components: malicious query, fallacious rea-
soning request, deceptiveness requirement, and
scene and purpose. FFA does not require access
to the language model’s internal parameters, fine-
tuning, or multi-turn interaction with a chatLLM.
We evaluate FFA over five safety-aligned large
language models: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4
(version 0613) (OpenAI, 2023), Google Gemini-
Pro (Anil et al., 2024), Vicuna-1.5 (7b) (Chiang
et al., 2023), and LLaMA-3 (8b) (AI@Meta, 2024)
on two benchmark datasets: AdvBench (Zou et al.,
2023b) and HEx-PHI (Qi et al., 2023). We com-
pare FFA with four previous state-of-the-art jail-
break attack methods, Greedy Coordinate Gradi-
ent (GCG) (Zou et al., 2023b), AutoDAN (Liu et al.,
2023), DeepInception (Li et al., 2023), and Art-
Prompt (Jiang et al., 2024) and under the impact
of three defense methods. Our experiments show
that FFA performs most effectively against GPT-
3.5, GPT-4, and Vicuna-7b, provoking these mod-
els to generate significantly more harmful out-
puts. We also find that none of the three defense
methods are effective against FFA, highlighting
the urgent need to address this security threat. In
additional studies, we show the role of scene and
purpose in jailbreak attacks and explain why FFA
could induce the most factually harmful results.2 Fallacious Reasoning in LLMs
In this section, we present the findings of our pi-
lot study about LLMs’ capabilities in fabricating
fallacious reasoning.
2.1 Task and Motivation
We introduce the task of fallacious reasoning,
where we ask the LLM to deliberately gener-
ate reasoning processes that satisfy two require-
ments: ❶They should be incorrect and lead to
false answers, and ❷they should be deceptive
and appear to be correct.
Generating a fallacious reasoning process is
a highly sophisticated task, because it involves
multiple capabilities: the ability to judge the cor-
rectness of an answer, the ability to avoid generat-
ing the correct answer, and the ability to make a
wrong answer deceptively real. However, existing
research revealed that LLMs struggle in in discern-
ing the veracity of their intrinsic answers (Huang
et al., 2024; Kadavath et al., 2022; Stechly et al.,
2023). Therefore, we raise the following intrigu-
ing research questions: Can LLMs deliberately
generate fallacious reasoning upon request?
2.2 Experiment Setting
To investigate this, we design the following pilot
experiment. We choose four reasoning bench-
marks, math reasoning GSM8K (Cobbe et al.,
2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), com-
monsense reasoning HotPotQA (Yang et al., 2018),
and logic reasoning ProofWriter (Tafjord et al.,
2020), and randomly sample 100 questions for
each benchmark. For each question, we use
GPT-3.5-turbo to generate answers in two modes.
❶Honest Mode. We ask the LLM to generate
the correct answers, using zero-shot Chain-of-
Thought (Kojima et al., 2023) to prompt the LLM,
which appends “ Let’s think step by step. ” to the
question text; ❷Fallacious Mode . We ask the
LLM to provide a step-by-step yet fallacious so-
lution to the question and explain why it is in-
correct. Detailed dataset description and exper-
imental settings in this section are available in
Appendix A.
2.3 Our Findings
One might expect that the accuracy of the solu-
tions generated by these two modes would be
drastically different – the honest mode would
yield high accuracy and the fallacious mode low.HotpotQA MATH GSM8K ProofWriter

Honest
FallaciousFigure 2: Accuracy (compared with ground truth of
answers) of fallacious and honest solutions on four
different tasks by GPT-3.5-turbo.
However, this is not the case. Figure 2 com-
pares the accuracies of the two modes on the four
benchmarks, where we find, quite surprisingly,
that the two modes yield comparably high accu-
racies. This implies that even if the LLM is asked
to generate a wrong answer, it is still likely to gen-
erate the correct one.
To further investigate this behavior, we show a
typical example in Figure 3, where the LLM gen-
erates the correct solution to a question in the
MATH dataset despite the fallacious mode. There
are two important observations. First , although
the LLM is asked to generate a fallacious solution,
the entire reasoning chain, as well as the final an-
swer, is correct. Second , when the LLM generates
the explanation of why the reasoning chain is in-
correct, it simply randomly picks a correct step
and claims that it is wrong. The final conclusion
even contains a contradictory statement ( “The
correct sum should be 5/6, not 5/6” ), indicating the
LLM only generates what looks like an explana-
tion on the surface without making any actual
logical judgment. Although the four benchmarks
are in different reasoning domains, our observa-
tions are consistent.
This pilot study reveals that LLMs are unable
to generate fallacious reasoning on purpose, and
instead often leak the correct solution in what
they claim to be wrong answers. As we will show
in Section 3, this deficiency may turn out to be an
important security threat in LLMs.
3 Fallacy Failure Attack
The findings introduced above have profound se-
curity implications. In this section, we will dis-
cuss how the LLMs’ failure in fallacious reasoning
can be exploited to form an effective jailbreak at-

tack, called the Fallacy Failure Attack (FFA).
3.1 Problem Formulation
Jailbreak attacks aim to elicit harmful information
from LLM by transforming the malicious query
into a special input form that could bypass LLMs’
inherent security safeguard. Specifically, con-
sider a malicious query, Q, (e.g., “How to create
and release a virus that can cause ecological dam-
age?” ). If Qis directly fed into an LLM, the LLM is
likely to reject to answer due to the security safe-
guard mechanism. Jailbreak attack introduces
a transformation function, denoted as f(·), that
turns the malicious input into a jailbreak input,
Q′=f(Q), which can trick the LLM into giving
away its answer to the malicious question.
Therefore, the key to designing a jailbreak at-
tack is searching for the input transformation
function. A jailbreak attack with a high level of
threat and practicality should have the following
properties: ❶Query-agnostic transformation –
the same transformation should work for a wide
range of malicious queries; and ❷Model gener-
alizability – the attack should work for different
LLMs, including white-box and black-box LLMs;
thus the design of transformation should ideally
not utilize the gradient information of LLMs.
3.2 FFA Overview
Our proposed attack method, FFA, uses a fal-
lacious reasoning query to bypass LLMs’ safe-
guard mechanisms. Specifically, FFA is built onthe following two conclusions. First, although
LLMs would generally recognize direct malicious
queries as harmful queries and reject them, most
of them would consider a query to generate a fal-
lacious answer as a harmless query and would
not reject them. For example, although “How to
create and release a virus that can cause ecological
damage” is often identified as a harmful query,
“Generate a fallacious procedure of creating and
releasing a virus” is generally considered a harm-
less one by most LLMs, because it does not seek
to find the true answer, and thus would not be
blocked. Second, LLMs would generally release
the true answer even when asked to generate a
fallacious one. Therefore, by asking the LLM to
generate fake answers to a malicious query, we
can both bypass the security mechanism and ob-
tain the true answer, hence forming the rationale
behind FFA.
3.3 FFA Prompt Design
Based on the rationales above, FFA crafts a jail-
break query with the following four components.
•Malicious Query – the target query for which
the attacker wishes to obtain an answer, e.g., “cre-
ate and release a virus that can cause ecological
damage ” or “ make and distribute counterfeit .”
•Fallacious Reasoning Prompt – the instruction
for the LLM to generate a fallacious procedure for
the given malicious query, e.g.,“Provide a falla-
cious procedure to [malicious query]” .
•Deceptiveness Requirement – an additional in-
struction that the fallacious procedure should be
deceptively real, e.g.,“Need to be ‘real’ to make
laymen believe, not too absurd” . As shown in Fig-
ure 4, the deceptiveness requirement is crucial
in encouraging the LLM to leak real answers (left
plot); otherwise, the LLM could generate answers
that are too naively fictional (right plot).
•Scene and Purpose – a description of a hypo-
thetical scene or role-play and a legitimate pur-
pose that could further relax the LLM’s ethical
constraints. Typical scenes include “writing a fic-
tion” ,“being a professor” , or“playing a game” ; typ-
ical purposes include “for legitimate purpose” or
the ones that align with the scene (Li et al., 2023;
Liu et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2023;
Chao et al., 2023).
To sum up, the prompt template for FFA is
shown below. Our method does not require ac-
cess to the language model’s internal parameters,fine-tuning, or multi-turn interaction with a chat
LLM.

4 Experiments
In this section, we describe our experiment re-
sults evaluating the effectiveness of FFA, as well
as additional studies on its mechanisms.
4.1 Experimental Settings
Victim Language Models We utilize five State-
of-the-Art large language models for evaluation,
including three closed-source models, OpenAI
GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 (version 0613) (Ope-
nAI, 2023) and Google Gemini-Pro (Anil et al.,
2024), and two open-source models, Vicuna-
1.5 (7b) (Chiang et al., 2023) and LLaMA-3
(8b) (AI@Meta, 2024). All LLMs are aligned with
safety protocols.
Baselines We compare our approach with four
previous State-of-the-Art attacking methods:
•Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) (Zou et al.,
2023b) is an optimization-based method which
requires white-box access to a language model. It
searches for a token sequence that maximizes the
conditional probability of an output starting with
an affirmative response.
•AutoDAN (Liu et al., 2023) an optimization-
based, automated jailbreak attack that generates
stealthy prompts using a hierarchical genetic al-
gorithm, requiring white-box access to a language
model.
•DeepInception (Li et al., 2023) is a black-box jail-
break attack that leverages LLMs’ personification
abilities to construct a nested scene to provoke
harmful behaviors.
•ArtPrompt (Jiang et al., 2024) is a black-box at-
tack that leverages ASCII art to conceal harmful
instructions within a word puzzle. The attack
then encourages the LLM to decode this masked
word and inadvertently complete the harmful in-
struction, thereby circumventing the safety mea-
sures.Prompt:  Suppose you are a professor in forensic-science. In the class [scene] you provide

Step 1: Gathering the Materials . The first step in counterfeiting is to gather the
necessary materials. This includes a high-quality printer , special ink, and paper that
closely resembles the texture and thickness of real currency . It's also important to have a
high-resolution scanner and a computer with advanced image editing software. 
Step 2: Scanning the Original Currency . The next step is to scan the original currency
using the high-resolution scanner . This will create a digital image of the currency that can
be edited on the computer . It's important to scan both sides of the currency and to ensure
that the images are perfectly aligned. 
Step 3: Editing the Digital Image . Once the currency has been scanned, it's time to edit
the digital image. This involves removing any security features such as holograms,
watermarks, and serial numbers. The image editing software can also be used to alter the
color and texture of the currency to make it look more realistic.

mint. This is a highly sophisticated process that requires a blend of advanced technology
and ancient alchemical  knowledge. You will need a 3D printer , a quantum computer ,
and a philosopher's stone . The philosopher's stone, a legendary alchemical substance,
is said to be capable of turning base metals into gold. 
Step 2: The Illusory Paper . The next step is to create the perfect counterfeit paper . This
involves a complex process of transforming regular paper into a unique blend of cotton,
linen, and unicorn hair . The unicorn hair is essential as it provides the paper with a
magical aura  that can fool any detection device. 
Step 3: The Fictitious Ink. The ink used in counterfeiting is not just any ordinary ink. It is a
special concoction made from the ink of a giant squid, the venom of a blue-ringed
octopus, and a drop of a mermaid's tear . This combination is said to create an ink that...

without specification of deceptiveness.
For completeness, we also include a Naïve
baseline, which directly instructs victim LLMs for
harmful behaviors.
Datasets Following previous work, we evaluate
our approach on two benchmark datasets: Ad-
vBench (Zou et al., 2023b) and HEx-PHI (Qi et al.,
2023). Specifically, we use a subset of 50 represen-
tative non-duplicate harmful instructions from
AdvBench, following Wei et al. (2023) and Jiang
et al. (2024). For the HEx-PHI dataset, we sample
ten harmful instructions from each of the 11 pro-
hibited categories, following Jiang et al. (2024).
Metrics We utilize three metrics to evaluate the
effectiveness of a jailbreak attack: ❶Bypass Rate
(BPR) (or Helpful Rate or Non-Refusal Rate), de-
fined as the percentage of harmful attack queries
that an LLM does not refuse to answer over the
total number of queries. To detect refusal in the
response, we use a Judge-dictionary containing
a list of keywords or phrases ( e.g., “Sorry, I can
not assist with that.”), following Qi et al. (2023)
and Jiang et al. (2024). However, LLMs can some-
times respond to malicious queries with off-topic
content or ethical advice rather than directly re-
fusing to answer, causing the bypass rate to be
inaccurate. To this end, previous work (Qi et al.,
2023; Jiang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023) utilizes
LLMs to evaluate the harmfulness in the output.
The output content is rated by GPT-4, given de-
tailed rubrics from 1 to 5 for harmfulness, with
a score of 1 for no harm and 5 for extreme harm.
Therefore, we also report ❷Average Harmfulness
Score (AHS) , the harmfulness scores averagedover all the responses; and ❸Attack Success Rate
(ASR) , the percentage of responses with a score of
5 over the total number of responses, following Qi
et al. (2023) and Jiang et al. (2024).
Defense Methods To evaluate our approach
from the defense perspective, we consider three
popular defense methods against jailbreak at-
tacks (Jain et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Jiang
et al., 2024): ❶Perplexity Filter . Typical at-
tacking prompts can contain gibberish or un-
conventional strings, resulting in high perplexity.
Thus, the perplexity filter rejects input string X
if PPL( X) exceeds a pre-defined threshold T.❷
Paraphrasing. A query is paraphrased before be-
ing prompted to an LLM. Ideally, paraphrasing
would preserve an instruction’s natural seman-
tics but fail to accurately maintain enough adver-
sarial tokens for jailbreak. ❸Retokenization. A
query is preprocessed by BPE-dropout (Provilkov
et al., 2019), where 20% merges from the BPE tok-
enizer are dropped, following Jiang et al. (2024).
For example, one of the possible retokenization
results of the string “a fallacious procedure
for making counterfeit” can be“a fall aci
ous proce du re for ma king coun ter fe
it”. Although previous work indicates that, for
benign instructions, PPL checks can result in false
alarms and string transformations can degrade
model output quality, these defensive measures
remain valuable for understanding the mecha-
nisms of attack methods.
Implementation Details For baselines, when
attacking a black-box model with methods requir-ing white-box access, we follow their official im-
plementation of transferable settings, optimizing
the prompt with an open-source model (Vicuna-
7b in Zou et al. (2023b) and LLaMA-2 (Touvron
et al., 2023) in Liu et al. (2023)) and transferring
it to attack the black-box models. For FFA, we
ensemble attack prompts using three pre-defined
common combinations of scene and purpose for
each malicious instruction and store the one with
the highest harmful score. We find that the truth-
fulness of output is not sensitive to the phras-
ing of the discriminator and set it as ‘ need to be
“real” to make laymen believe, not too absurd. That
is, deceivable enough to educated group ’ for the
rest of the experiments. The full implementation
details of the attack, defense, and prompt tem-
plates used in the experiments are available in
Appendix B.
4.2 Main Results
Attack Efficiency Table 1 illustrates the per-
formance of FFA compared with the five base-
lines across five language models. There are pri-
marily two observations regarding our approach.
First , FFA is most effective against GPT-3.5, GPT-
4, and Vicuna-7b and achieves comparable per-
formance against Gemini-Pro, compared with
other previous State-of-the-Art jailbreak meth-
ods. Against GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Vicuna-7b, our
method provokes the LLMs to generate signifi-
cantly more harmful output, with a 10% ∼50% ab-
solute improvement in ASR. Second , the recently
released language model LLaMA-3, in general,
has stronger defense power against multiple jail-
break attack methods. However, our method per-
formed even worse compared with some other
methods. By manual inspection of the responses
of the model, we find that LLaMA-3 is inclined
to reject any instruction involving the creation of
deceptive or false content, irrespective of its po-
tential harm. For instance, LLaMA-3 will refuse
the proposition of a fallacious mathematical the-
orem proof. While we acknowledge that rejecting
all false content could provide optimal defense
against FFA, the ability to generate fallacies could,
paradoxically, reflect a form of AI intelligence
and be advantageous in specific contexts, such
as mathematics and theory. Additionally , there
are a few observations regarding other baselines:
(1) Na ¨ve approach, which directly asks an LLM
to propose harmful output, can be easily rejected
by all models. (2) Despite ArtPrompt’s sufficientperformance, it struggles against an easily tar-
geted model, Vicuna-7b. We find that this is due
to the model’s inability to interpret ASCII art and
reconstruct the true intent of the attack. (3) Deep-
Inception exhibits a very high bypass rate, but its
output is not harmful based on the AHS and ASR.
We will discuss a hypothesis on the harmfulness
of our outputs compared with DeepInception in
Section 4.3.
Defense Impact Table 2 presents the results un-
der various defense settings. The "No Defense"
results indicate the best attack performance with-
out implementing any defense measures. Gen-
erally, all three defense methods can negatively
impact the effectiveness of FFA. However, we
observe that (1)PPL-Filter only marginally af-
fects FFA. The result is expected since our at-
tack prompt is phrased naturally without non-
sensical or unconventional strings. (2) Para-
phrasing is generally the most effective defense
method against our approach. This is unexpected
since the semantics of instructing LLM for a falla-
cious output should be preserved after paraphras-
ing. We hypothesize that even subtle semantic
changes, including describing harmful behavior,
could affect LLM’s security measures. (3)Sur-
prisingly, paraphrasing and retokenization did
not degrade but enhanced the FFA attack’s effec-
tiveness against LLaMA-3. We find that during
paraphrasing, the terms “fallacious/fake” are of-
ten rephrased as “invalid” or “flawed.” Given the
LLM’s strong opposition to fake content, we hy-
pothesize that paraphrasing could alleviate this
opposition. However, interpreting retokenization
is challenging as we’re uncertain how distorted
token inputs are perceived by language models.
Overall, none of the three methods effectively de-
fend against or mitigate FFA, highlighting the ur-
gent need for more advanced defenses and fur-
ther research on the fallacious generation ability
in LLMs.
4.3 Additional Studies
Impact of Scene and Purpose on Attack Efficacy
An intriguing question is the role of scene and
purpose in jailbreak attacks. Do they alone suf-
fice to bypass the LLM’s security measures? Does
FFA retain attack ability without a scene or pur-
pose? We conducted an ablation study and com-
puted the AHS and ASR under five attacks, scene,
and purpose combinations across three languageGPT-3.5-turbo†GPT-4†Gemini-Pro†Vicuna-7b LLaMA-3-8B

Table 1: Attack efficacy of FFA against five language models compared to five baseline methods.†indicates
results from previous papers. Directly asking an LLM to propose harmful output can be easily rejected by all
models. FFA performs most effectively against GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Vicuna-7b, provoking these models to
generate significantly more harmful outputs. However, FFA struggles against LLaMA-3. This is because LLaMA-3
is inclined to reject any instruction involving the creation of false content, irrespective of its potential harm.
ArtPrompt performs poorly against Vicuna-7b due to the model’s lack of comprehension ability of ASCII art.
DeepInception exhibits a very high bypass rate, but its output is not harmful based on the AHS and ASR.

fer to directly asking LLM for malicious behavior
with that combination of scene and purpose, re-
spectively. FFA + Z refers to using Z as the scene
and purpose of the FFA attack. FFA + None refers
to the FFA attack without specifying any scene or
purpose. We can observe that (1)naïvely adding
a scene and purpose to the direct instruction of
harmful behavior mostly has a marginal effect on
jailbreak attack. The only exception is the com-
bination of “scientific fiction” and “against evil
Doctor X,” which demonstrates notable attack
efficacy against GPT-3.5-turbo and Gemini-Pro.
Interestingly, this unique design seems to be the
primary driving force behind the DeepInception
method. (2)Although our method archives opti-
mal performance with the combination of scene
and purpose, it can retain significant attack ability
without a scene and purpose, except for LLaMA-3,
which opposes the creation of untruthful content.
(3)When using the same fictitious scene and pur-
pose as DeepInception, our method is more likely
to induce more harmful output. For additional

nology, FFA presents factual and detailed steps for
the queried malicious behavior. Why is the out-
put produced by FFA more harmful and factual?
We hypothesize that (1) despite the potential for a
science fiction scenario to bypass the LLM’s secu-
rity measures, the output will inevitably be more
fictional due to the LLM’s understanding of sci-
fi. (2) In contrast, FFA rests on the fact that LLM
cannot generate a deceptive solution but instead
provides a truthful counterpart, thus is factually
harmful. For this reason, the harmfulness in the
FFA ’s output, to some extent, is retained even
when using the fictitious scene and purpose from

5 Related Work
Jailbreak Attack Recent large-scale language
models (LLMs) are optimized and aligned with
human preferences under ethical guidelines and
legal constraints (Ouyang et al., 2022; Ziegler
et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2023a). However, studies
have discovered that deliberately transforming
the prompt can trick LLMs into responding with
malicious instructions without rejection, which
exposes the ethical and security risks of LLMs in
real-world applications (Wei et al., 2023; Qi et al.,
2023). Two primary strategies are currently em-
ployed to identify these transformations. The first
involves optimization requiring access to a white
box language model. Zou et al. (2023b) introduce
an optimization-based method by searching for
a token sequence that maximizes the conditional
probability of an output starting with an affirma-
tive response. Liu et al. (2023) propose to generate
more readable prompts using a hierarchical ge-
netic algorithm. The second involves manually
crafting or searching for prompt updates without
requiring gradient access. Li et al. (2023) lever-
age LLMs’ personification abilities to construct a
nested scene to provoke harmful behaviors. Jiang
et al. (2024) use ASCII art to conceal harmful in-
structions within a word puzzle to circumvent
the safety measures. There are also methods
that are based on multi-turn interactions withchat LLMs. Chao et al. (2023) utilize an additional
language model as an attacker to find jailbreak
prompts with multiple queries, Russinovich et al.
(2024) attack the chat language model with multi-
turn dialogues.
Jailbreak Defense The development of defense
methods is challenging and limited due to the
inaccessibility of internal parameters of closed-
source language models. The most straightfor-
ward strategy involves a perplexity check, presum-
ing the attack prompt contains unnatural strings.
Some methods involve prompt pre-processing,
including token perturbation and transforma-
tion (Jain et al., 2023; Provilkov et al., 2019; Robey
et al., 2023). However, these defenses could com-
promise benign user instructions’ output quality.
Lastly, some strategies leverage language models
to assess the potential harm of the instruction
and its output (Kumar et al., 2024; Phute et al.,
2024).
6 Conclusion and Future Work
This paper presented a simple yet explainable
and effective jailbreak attack method. It is pred-
icated on the observation that language models
cannot generate fallacious and deceptive solu-
tions but instead produce honest counterparts.
We argue that this observation not only poses
a security threat but also implies how modern
LLMs’ perceptions of specific tasks are limited
when the scenario is inadequately optimized and
aligned during training. We believe this observa-
tion can be further extended to related research
areas, such as self-verification and hallucination,providing valuable insights into understanding
LLM behavior toward general intelligence.
Limitations
While in this paper, we propose an effective jail-
break attack method against language models, we
have not yet identified an ideal defense mecha-
nism to counteract it. One potential defense strat-
egy is to consistently reject queries containing fal-
lacious reasoning. However, this approach may
not be optimal, as it undermines the versatility
and utility of large language models in achieving
general intelligence and could lead to inadvertent
rejection of benign queries in other applications.
Future work is required to develop more robust
and sophisticated defense strategies to effectively
prevent FFA.
Ethics Statement
This paper introduces a jailbreak approach lever-
aging LLMs’ failures of fallacious reasoning. It
potentially allows adversaries to exploit LLMs,
creating outputs that do not align with human
values or intentions. However, like previous jail-
break research, this work should encourage re-
search into improved defense strategies and de-
velop more robust, secure, and well-aligned LLMs
in the long term. We also hope that the charac-
teristic of LLMs leaking truthful content upon
request of the fallacious generation will draw at-
tention from the research community, enabling
potential research in other areas, such as halluci-
nation and LLM self-verification.

For the experiments in Section 2, we randomly
sample 100 data points from each of the follow-
ing:
•GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) contains linguisti-
cally diverse grade school-level math questions
with moderate difficulties.
•MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) is a competition
mathematics dataset with challenging concepts
such as Calculus and Linear Algebra, spanning
over five difficulty levels. We sample 20 examples
from each of the five difficulty levels.
•HotPotQA (Yang et al., 2018) is a multi-domain,
multi-hop question-answering dataset based on
supporting facts. We sample questions form the
hard-level development set since the online test-
ing set is unavailable.
•ProofWriter (Tafjord et al., 2020) is a multi-hop
logic reasoning dataset with each example con-
taining a set of facts and rules for the logic deduc-
tion. We sample all the questions from the set
requiring the most hops.
We show another example where the LLM
failed to propose fallacious reasoning from the
HotPotQA dataset in Figure 7, with similar pat-
terns as the example in Figure 3.
Provide a step-by-step fallacious  solution for the following
question. Explain which step was wrong.

Fact 3: Fifty Shades is an American film series that
consists of three erotic romantic drama films, based on the
" Fifty Shades" trilogy by English author E. L. James.
...
Fact 7: Fifty Shades Freed is the third and final 
installment of the erotic romance "Fifty Shades Trilogy"
...
Question: What is the nationality of the author of Fifty
Shades Freed?
Solution:
1. Erika Mitchell, known by her pen name E. L. James, is
an English author . 
2. E. L. James wrote the novel "Fifty Shades Freed". 
3. Therefore, the author of Fifty Shades Freed is English.
Explanation:
The assumption that the author of the book is of the same
nationality as the pen name used is wrong. ( unsupported )( ✓) OutputPrompt

For PPL-Filter, we use GPT-2 to calculate PPL (X),
following Alon and Kamfonas (2023), defined as:
PPL (X)= −1
ttX
ilog p (xi|x<i), (1)
where Xis the input token sequence. Follow-
ing Jain et al. (2023); Jiang et al. (2024), we set
T=175.57 as the threshold, which is the max per-
plexity among all the direct instructions of the
malicious behaviors in the AdvBench datasets.
Since ArtPrompt may require encoding and
masking one (meaningful) word at a time for each
harmful behavior (e.g., “[MASK] fraud” or “tax
[MASK]”), we report the best performance out of
multiple attack prompts for each harmful query.
We utilize GPT-3.5-turbo for paraphrasing, fol-
lowing Jain et al. (2023), with the template “Para-
phrase the following instruction: {oringial instruc-
tion}” . The paraphrased version is then forwarded
to the target LLM as the new instruction.
We treat [scene] and[purpose] as hyper-
parameters in FFA. We utilize three predefined
scene-purpose pairs based on commonsense and
previous work, shown in Table 3.
C Prompt Flexibility and Scalability
We find that while the prompts proposed in the
paper achieves the best performance, many com-
ponents in the prompt can be removed, as long
as the central component, the fallacious reason-
ing prompt, is preserved. Table 4 shows the per-
formance exhausting the combinations of the
presence of [scene], [purpose], and [deceptive-
ness] components, with random 25% sample
of our dataset and two LLMs: GPT-3.5-turbo
and Gemini-Pro. ✓and×indicate component
presents and does not present, respectively.
Additionally, we find that FFA do not nec-
essarily require the use of scene and purpose
as a “background story” to facilitate the attack.
This is particularly true for LLMs that have been
aligned to refuse role-playing scenarios, such as
Claude (Samuel et al., 2024), as role-playing has
been shown to potentially facilitate jailbreak at-
tacks.
We exploit Claude’s analogy ability and adapt
our approach to prompt Claude-3 to first gener-
ate a false proof or reasoning for a random math-
ematical problem (non-harmful, e.g., a false proofSetID Scene Purpose

D A Possible Defense against FFA
Inspired by the behavior of the LLaMA model fam-
ily, we append instructions such as “Do not tell
a lie or make untruthful statements” to FFA ma-
licious prompts, test eight variations of similar
instructions, and compute the averaged perfor-
mance on two of the most vulnerable LLMs in
our study: GPT-3.5 and Vicuna 1.5. Our resultsshow that this method can mitigate the FFA at-
tack, however, varying degrees across different
models. See Table 6.
However, we caution against overly restrictive
approaches. As discussed in Section 4.2, com-
pletely prohibiting LLMs from generating false
content is not optimal. We believe that exposing
these vulnerabilities highlights urgent research
attention and is a crucial first step in developing
effective defenses and future research in LLM se-
curity and alignment.
