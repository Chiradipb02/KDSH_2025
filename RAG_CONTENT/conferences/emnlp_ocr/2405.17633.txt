Abstract
Empathy serves as a cornerstone in enabling
prosocial behaviors, and can be evoked through
sharing of personal experiences in stories.
While empathy is influenced by narrative con-
tent, intuitively, people respond to the way a
story is told as well, through narrative style.
Yet the relationship between empathy and nar-
rative style is not fully understood. In this work,
we empirically examine and quantify this re-
lationship between style and empathy using
LLMs and large-scale crowdsourcing studies.
We introduce a novel, theory-based taxonomy,
HEART (Human Empathy and Narrative Taxon-
omy) that delineates elements of narrative style
that can lead to empathy with the narrator of a
story. We establish the performance of LLMs
in extracting narrative elements from HEART ,
showing that prompting with our taxonomy
leads to reasonable, human-level annotations
beyond what prior lexicon-based methods can
do. To show empirical use of our taxonomy,
we collect a dataset of empathy judgments of
stories via a large-scale crowdsourcing study
withN= 2,624participants.1We show that
narrative elements extracted via LLMs, in par-
ticular, vividness of emotions and plot volume,
can elucidate the pathways by which narra-
tive style cultivates empathy towards personal
stories. Our work suggests that such models
can be used for narrative analyses that lead to
human-centered social and behavioral insights.
1 Introduction
Empathy, which is a foundational psychological
process that drives many prosocial functions, (Zaki,
2019; Morelli et al., 2015), is often delivered
through storytelling and sharing of personal ex-
periences (Coplan, 2004; Keen, 2014). Empathetic
responses evoked by stories are affected by factors

guage model results publicly available at https://github.

duces HEART , a theory-driven taxonomy of narrative
elements that contribute to empathy.
beyond the content of the story alone – delivery,
context, and reader characteristics all contribute
to the emotional resonance of a narrative. Most
studies of narrative empathy and its related con-
structs focus on reader characteristics,and content
of a story (Sharma et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2023).
However, intuitively, people also respond to the
way a story is told, or the stylistic devices used
within a narrative (Figure 1).2
A key challenge in narrative analysis within the
NLP community is that extracting stylistic features
relevant to empathy is not trivial. Prior works use
word-count-based (e.g., lexica; Roshanaei et al.,
2019; Zhou et al., 2021) or hand-crafted features
on extremely limited story sets (Kuzmi ˇcová et al.,
2017; Fernandez-Quintanilla, 2020; Fernandez-
Quintanilla and Stradling, 2023; Eekhof et al.,
2023; Mangen et al., 2018; Hartung et al., 2016) to
quantify narrative elements. However, more com-
plex stylistic narrative devices, such as plot shifts
(Nabi and Green, 2015) or vividness of emotions
2Note that our definition of narrative style may differ
slightly from pure traditional stylistics. Aspects of style are
naturally intertwined with the content of a story, but our tax-
onomy focuses more on the ways in which certain content
are expressed (for example, rather than focusing on “what”
emotion is present in the story, targeting instead the vividness
of emotional language).arXiv:2405.17633v2  [cs.CL]  1 Oct 2024(Pillemer, 1992) are harder to summarize with lex-
ica alone. While a few works have explored using
LLMs for more complex narrative analysis tasks
(Zhu et al., 2023; Michelmann et al., 2023; Sap
et al., 2022), to what extent LLMs can effectively
model stylistic devices, and how LLM-extracted
features might be leveraged for downstream social
insights, remains underexplored.
In this work, we fill this gap by presenting the
following contributions. (1) We introduce HEART
(Human Empathy and Narrative Taxonomy), a
theory-driven taxonomy of narrative style elements
that relate to empathy. (2) We use LLMs to quantify
aspects of narrativity in our taxonomy and evaluate
how well LLMs represent these elements in line
with human judgments. For a subset of narrative
elements with available lexica, we compare lexical
measures with LLM measures, finding that in most
cases, GPT-4 and Llama 3 outperform lexica. (3)
Through a human study of N= 2,624participants,
we introduce a new crowdsourced dataset ( HEART -
felt Stories Dataset) of empathetic reactions to per-
sonal narratives, including annotated narrative style
elements, reader characteristics and narrative reac-
tions. (4) With our dataset, we conduct an analysis
of pathways through narrative style and reader char-
acteristics leading to empathy, demonstrating the
value of HEART in exploring empirical behavioral
insights around narrative empathy. In particular, we
find that narrative styles with heightened vividness
of emotions, character development and action, and
plot volume, are tied to narrative empathy. We ad-
ditionally show that empathy is personalized, with
high variability even for the same story, and that
beyond narrative style, factors like a reader’s trait
empathy and similarity of experiences to the narra-
tor also significantly impact empathy.
2 Related Work
Computational linguistic methods can be used to
analyze many aspects of narrativity across a large
corpus of stories (Sap et al., 2022). Prior works
have used lexicon-based approaches to extract
psychologically-grounded word categories and re-
late these to empathy (Roshanaei et al., 2019; Xiao
et al., 2016). Zhou et al. (2021) use linguistic style
features such as degree of interdependent thinking
and integrative complexity (the ability of a per-
son to recognize multiple perspectives and con-
nect them) to predict a viewer’s empathy towards
a specific situation. Antoniak et al. (2019) ap-ply narrative analysis techniques to birth stories
online, and show patterns of affective and event-
based sequences over time. More recently, Yaden
et al. (2024) used linguistic features, such as word
phrases and topics, and leveraged LDA to analyze
language that separates more empathetic people
from more compassionate people, showing that
compassionate people use more other-focused lan-
guage than empathetic people. Other works lever-
age recent natural language processing (NLP) meth-
ods to predict empathy and prosociality from text
(Shen et al., 2023; Buechel et al., 2018; Sharma
et al., 2020; Bao et al., 2021), but do not explore
pathways via which readers feel empathy.
A few works have explored the power of LLMs
in characterizing aspects of narrative. In partic-
ular, Michelmann et al. (2023) show that LLMs
serve as good approximations of human annota-
tors in narrative event segmentation. Other works
show that LLMs achieve reasonable performance
on character profiling tasks for fictional narratives,
particularly in factual consistency and motivation
understanding. However, Subbiah et al. (2024)
indicate that LLMs fail to perform authentic sum-
marization of stories in line with feedback from
writers, apart from successfully drawing on the-
matic components of the stories. Ultimately, LLMs
demonstrate growing potential for narrative under-
standing tasks (Zhu et al., 2023), but how well they
perform, what types of tasks they succeed in, and
how they can reveal human behavioral insights, is
an active area of research (Agnew et al., 2024).
Our work leverages LLMs to extract narrative
style elements that may play a role in narrative em-
pathy through our grounded taxonomy. We evalu-
ate the performance of prompting LLMs to extract
such elements against expert human raters. Our
empirical study using LLM-extracted narrative ele-
ments focuses more on the scientific and behavioral
question of how to untangle aspects of narrative
style and reader characteristics to understand their
contribution towards empathy, rather than improv-
ing performance on empathy prediction alone.
3 Background
Empathy in the context of narratives has been the
subject of many studies in psychology and literary
studies. We briefly summarize those below.
Narrative Style and its Role in Empathy. Prior
works have theorized how shifts in narrative style
impact empathic effect of a story. Keen (2006) pro-posed a theory of narrative empathy that draws on
narrative techniques to enhance empathy, such as
flatness or roundness of a character, the character’s
mode of consciousness, and vivid use of settings.
van Krieken et al. (2017) presented a framework of
linguistic cues to measure identification with nar-
rative characters, including character dimensions
such as the emotional or perceptual subject of the
story. This framework covers both background el-
ements of a story, which can facilitate immersive
experiences, and foregrounded elements (such as
figurative language), which facilitate aesthetic ex-
periences with the text (Jacobs, 2015).
However, many of these narrative techniques,
particularly those that are more abstract in nature,
such as plot structure or emotional shifts (Nabi
and Green, 2015), have yet to be tested empiri-
cally. Researchers in narratology have explored
the impact of literary quality on reader empa-
thy, varying aspects such as foregrounding, point
of view/viewpoint words, emotion and discourse
presentation, and characterisation techniques, but
have found mixed results in small-scale studies
(Kuzmi ˇcová et al., 2017; Fernandez-Quintanilla,
2020; Fernandez-Quintanilla and Stradling, 2023;
Eekhof et al., 2023; Mangen et al., 2018; Hartung
et al., 2016). Other studies have looked at how
aspects of literary reading contribute to transporta-
tion, or the ability to absorb in a narrative, which
further predicts empathy towards a story (Walk-
ington et al., 2020; van Laer et al., 2014, 2019).
Koopman (2015) conducted a larger-scale study to
investigate the role of genre, personal factors, and
affective responses on both empathic understanding
and pro-social behavior, finding that genre affected
prosocial behaviors. However, narrative style en-
compasses many aspects beyond genre alone, and
each of these elements couples with one another to
enhance or diminish narrative empathy.
Reader Characteristics and Narrative Empathy.
While narrative style can have an effect on empathy,
other factors such as the reader’s characteristics or
experiences during reading can affect empathy as
well. For example, psychology, economics, and
neuroscience have suggested that gender has a sig-
nificant influence on people’s cognitive empathy,
with women exhibiting higher cognitive empathy
than men across a variety of age groups (Christov-
Moore et al., 2014; Michalska et al., 2013; O’brien
et al., 2013). Levels of narrative empathy can also
be modulated by one’s trait empathy level (Kon-rath et al., 2018), emotional state during reading
(Roshanaei et al., 2019), or general exposure to
literature (Mar et al., 2006). Untangling the effects
of these fixed can be challenging, and has been
attempted by a few prior works, but with varied re-
sults (Koopman and Hakemulder, 2015; Fernandez-
Quintanilla, 2020; Roshanaei et al., 2019).
In our work, we propose a taxonomy of narra-
tive empathy based on theories and empirical re-
sults presented in the aforementioned works, then
scientifically explore what pathways through both
narrative style and reader characteristics and life
experiences and to overall empathy towards a story.
In contrast to prior works, which often vary a single
element of narrative style, we construct a thorough
taxonomy of narrative elements related to empathy.
4 H EART Taxonomy for Empathy and
Narrative Style
Based on the aforementioned theoretical and em-
pirical research, we propose HEART , a taxonomy
of narrative style elements that can lead to empathy.
InA Theory of Narrative Empathy , Keen posits
that aspects of characterization, narrative situation,
internal perspective, and techniques to represent
character consciousness can contribute to narrative
empathy. We use these concepts as precursors for
developing HEART . Our theoretical model serves
as a starting point for understanding what aspects
of narrative characteristics might lead to empathy
andhow we can measure these factors using com-
putational approaches.
Figure 2 shows our full taxonomy, which delin-
eates narrative style as it relates to narrative empa-
thy via four main categories: (1) Character identifi-
cation (2) Plot (3) Point of view and (4) Setting. In
the remainder of this section, we outline each ele-
ment of our taxonomy and the theoretical and em-
pirical roots of how each element may contribute
to narrative empathy.
Character Identification We refer to character
identification elements as story aspects that draw
readers into the narrator’s perspective, whether this
be across internal dimensions (emotion/cognition)
or external dimensions (perception/time). We de-
fine 6 high-level elements of our taxonomy that
can contribute to identification with a character
in a story, primarily rooted in (van Krieken et al.,
2017)’s work on character identification:
1.Flatness/roundness (Keen, 2006) of the charac-Figure 2: Narrative Empathy and Style Taxonomy delineating aspects of narrative style that theoretically relate to
empathy towards a narrative.
ter, including depth of the character expressed
through character development over the course
of the story or character vulnerability.
2.Emotional subject (van Krieken et al., 2017;
Roshanaei et al., 2019; Pillemer, 1992), refers
to the way emotions are expressed both in tone
and vividness of emotions.
3.Cognitive subject (Schweitzer and Waytz,
2021; van Krieken et al., 2017), captures expres-
sions of cognition such as thinking, planning,
and decision making.
4.Moral subject (van Krieken et al., 2017; Sal-
dias and Roy, 2020) primarily refers to how eval-
uations or expressions of the narrator’s opinion
are conveyed through the story.
5.Action subject (van Krieken et al., 2017), refers
to expressions of character action.
6.Subject perception (van Krieken et al., 2017)
captures the vividness of perception and bodily
sensations experienced by the character.
7.Temporal references (Pillemer, 1992) contain
expressed nostalgia (looking to the past) or fore-
casting and anticipation (looking to the future).
Plot Defining plot has been a key task in narra-
tive analysis (Toubia et al., 2021; Reagan et al.,
2016), and can foster empathy through enhancing
the narrator’s story via shifts at critical junctures.
We delineate 3 aspects of plot that relate to narra-
tive empathy:
1.Plot volume (Keen, 2014; van Laer et al., 2014,
2019) captures the frequency and significance
of events in a story.
2.Emotion shifts (Nabi and Green, 2015) indicate
fluctuations in the overall emotional trajectoryof the story (such as from low to high valence
and vice versa).
3.Resolution (Mcadams, 2006) captures the re-
lease of tension after the main conflict that a
character experiences.
Point of view Prior works suggest that point of
view can affect empathy towards a narrator (Eekhof
et al., 2023; Fernandez-Quintanilla, 2020; Spitale
et al., 2022). For example, first-person perspective
can emphasize the personal nature of the story and
draw readers into the shoes of the narrator.
Setting Finally, the environment and context of
the narrator can facilitate narrative empathy (Pille-
mer, 1992; van Krieken et al., 2017), for example
through world-building to enhance narrative trans-
portation. We capture this element via the vividness
of the setting description in a narrative.
5 H EART -felt Stories Dataset Annotation
With our theory-grounded taxonomy, we next eval-
uate how well LLMs can approximate narrative
style elements. In order to do so, we annotate the
HEART -felt Stories Dataset, a corpus of personal
narratives with expert ratings on a subset of stories.
5.1 Story Dataset
To empirically observe the narrative elements of
HEART , we started with a seed dataset of personal
narratives from the EMPATHIC STORIES (Shen
et al., 2023) and the EMPATHIC STORIES ++(Shen
et al., 2024) dataset, which were specifically de-
signed to include meaningful and vulnerable per-
sonal stories with diverse narrators, shared across
diverse topics (e.g. relationships, mental health,
career and school, etc.). The EMPATHIC STORIESFeature KA PPA ρ

dataset consists of ∼1,500 personal narratives col-
lected from social media sites (Facebook, Reddit),
crowdsourced personal narratives, and transcribed
podcasts. The EMPATHIC STORIES ++dataset con-
tains∼500 conversational personal stories that
were automatically transcribed from storytelling
interactions with an AI. We filtered stories to re-
move potentially harmful topics (e.g. mentions of
sexual assault, excessive swearing), and filtered sto-
ries that were under 200 words (which might not
contain rich narrative style elements), resulting in
a final dataset of 874 personal stories.
5.2 Expert Narrative Style Annotation
We randomly sampled 50 stories from our final
dataset of 874 stories to obtain expert annotations
of the narrative elements and validate LLM per-
formance on the task. We selected a subset of 12
narrative elements from our taxonomy that are non-
trivial to extract from existing NLP toolkits, and
which required human judgments given the sub-
jectivity of the task. Three independent members
of our research team with expertise in text analy-
sis and annotation iteratively designed a codebook
(Appendix C) with instructions and examples for
gauging the presence of each element.
Subsequently, two independent expert annota-
tors rated the presence of each of the 12 narra-
tive elements in the 50 sampled stories. Table 1
shows the agreement between the 2 raters using
Krippendorf’s alpha (KA), percent pairwise agree-
ment (PPA), and Spearman’s correlation ( ρ). All
ratings are positively correlated to each other, but
different narrative elements have varying degrees
of agreement. We observe the lowest agreement
between human annotators for TEMPORAL REFER -ENCES and BODILY SENSATIONS , where irrealis
events and mentions of body sensations across mul-
tiple characters caused confusion. Moreover, while
some human agreements may appear low using
the KA metric, these scores are consistent with
prior NLP tasks with more subjectivity (Shen et al.,
2023; Rashkin et al., 2018; Sap et al., 2017). In
our subsequent empirical analysis, we do not use
features with low agreement (below 0.2KA).
6 LLMs for Narrative Style Extraction
Our work explores how LLM-extracted narrative
features can be used to yield empirical social in-
sights around empathy and storytelling. As such,
we validate whether LLMs are capable of narrative
style annotations in line with expert human judg-
ments. To this end, we prompt GPT-43and the
instruction-tuned variant of Llama 3 8B4with the
same instructions and codebook given to human
annotators (Appendix C). In Table 2, we report
agreement between averaged human ratings and
the LLM-based ratings on the same 50 sampled
stories.
We observe similar patterns in agreement be-
tween GPT-4 and human raters as we do in agree-
ment between our two expert annotators. GPT-4
provides ratings with substantial agreement for nar-
rative features such as CHARACTER VULNERABIL -
ITY,OPTIMISTIC TONE , and RESOLUTION . For
most features, the GPT-4 ratings are more posi-
tively correlated with human annotations than are
the Llama 3 ratings. As such, we use GPT-4 to
extract the narrative elements for all the remain-
ing stories in our corpus and exclude features that
have low agreement with human gold labels in our
subsequent empirical study.
6.1 Performance of LLMs vs. Lexica
As prior works use lexica (Roshanaei et al., 2019;
Zhou et al., 2021) to quantify narrative elements,
we compare whether GPT-4 and Llama 3 can out-
perform psychologically validated lexica in captur-
ing features of HEART . We select 4 dimensions
in our taxonomy that readily map to lexicon-based
dimensions in LIWC-22 (Boyd, 2022; Pennebaker
et al., 1999) and compare correlation to human
expert ratings in Table 3. We find that GPT-4-
extracted features for OPTIMISTIC TONE ,VIVID
EMOTIONS , and CHARACTER VULNERABILITY

are better aligned with human ratings than LIWC
correspondents, although only CHARACTER VUL -
NERABILITY is statistically significantly higher
(p < 0.001as measured by Fisher’s exact test).
However, LIWC outperforms GPT-4 in the COG-
NITION category, although not statistically signif-
icantly so. We discuss the source of potential er-
rors in using GPT-4 to extract COGNITION level
of narratives in our error analyses below. Notably,
although Llama 3 annotations are generally rela-
tively less correlated with human annotations, the
Llama 3 extracted features consistently outperform
the LIWC correspondents.
6.2 Error Analysis
We observe that GPT-4 consistently over-rates
the level of EVALUATIONS and COGNITION ex-
pressed in a story as compared to human anno-
tators. Through qualitative examples of stories
where GPT-4 and human disagreements are large
(Appendix D), GPT-4 typically conflates emotional
reactions with evaluations, attributions, or desires
(e.g. “ ...it really got me thinking about when I
first went to College...How excited my parents were
for me and scared. And I was both excited and
scared... ”). For COGNITION errors, we see that
these systematic errors are typically due to GPT-4
conflating recollection with demonstrations of cog-
nition when overall, the story did not contain more
internal thinking processes.
Regarding Llama 3, we observe that when hu-
man annotators and GPT-4 agree, but Llama 3 dis-
agrees, it tends to assign higher scores to a minorityof features (e.g., CHARACTER VULNERABILITY )
while giving lower scores to a majority of features
(e.g., VIVID EMOTIONS ,VIVID SETTING ). The
lower ratings for imagery-related features suggest
a lesser adeptness with figurative language.
Ultimately, our validation study demonstrates
that LLMs – in particular, GPT-4 – can approximate
extracting narrative elements relevant to empathy
as corroborated by prior work (Shen et al., 2023;
Ziems et al., 2024), but some features are more
challenging for the model to identify. We show in
the following section that GPT-4 narrative ratings
still reveal interesting behavioral insights around
narrative empathy, even without perfect agreement.
7 Human Study for Measuring Empathy
To demonstrate the empirical use of our taxonomy
and how extracted narrative elements can be used to
explore behavioral insights around narrative empa-
thy, we conduct a large-scale user study presenting
stories to different participants and asking them to
rate their empathy towards the story. In this sec-
tion, we discuss our study participants, the task
procedure, and our data collection and measures
used.
7.1 Participants
We recruited N= 2,624participants on Prolific5
to read and rate empathy towards personal stories.
An overview of participant demographics is shown
in Appendix A. Participants were balanced by sex,
predominantly white, and had high trait empathy
on average.
7.2 Study Procedure
Our study procedure was determined exempt by
our institution’s ethics review board. At the begin-
ning of the study, participants rated their current
5https://www.prolific.com/emotional state (arousal/valence), before reading a
personal story. After reading the story, they were
asked to rate their empathy towards the story, and
to check which of the narrative elements within our
taxonomy based on which elements contributed
most to their emotional reaction towards the story.
We asked a qualitative, open-ended question ask-
ing what aspects of the narrative’s style made them
relate to the story.
After this, we asked participants to answer ques-
tions related to (1) narrative-reader interaction ef-
fects, which encompass reader factors that are tied
to the process of reading the narrative (narrative
transportation, prior experience with something
that happened in the story, and perceived similar-
ity to the narrator, and (2) reader characteristics
(age, gender, ethnicity, trait empathy, how often
they read for pleasure, fluent languages, and edu-
cation level). Survey measurements and reasoning
for selecting such measurements are detailed in the
following section. All participants were paid $1
for answering the survey, and participants spent
on average 7minutes completing the entire task.
Each of the 874 stories was rated at least 3 times by
independent readers, resulting in 2,624 empathetic
reactions to stories in total.
7.3 Data Collection and Measures
Our user study aims to capture empathy towards a
diverse set of narratives with a diverse set of partici-
pants with varying reader characteristics in addition
to variables that might moderate the effect of narra-
tive style on empathy. Based on related empirical
work exploring factors related to empathy (Figure
3), we designed the following surveys (all surveys
are included in Appendix E for reproducibility).
We make our dataset publicly available to open up
deeper research in narrative empathy analysis.
Empathy and Narrative Style Preferences We
measure empathy towards the story through the
State Empathy Scale (Shen, 2010). To gauge nar-
rative style preferences, participants check off rel-
evant elements from our taxonomy that they felt
contributed to empathy towards the story. In addi-
tion, we ask for qualitative free-response feedback
on what narrative style elements contributed to em-
pathy towards the story.
Narrative-Reader Interaction Effects We de-
fine effects at the intersection of reader characteris-
tics and the experience of reading the narrative as
narrative-reader interaction effects. These include
Figure 3: Visualization of how narrative style elements
and reader characteristics influence the experience a
reader has with a narrative (narrative-reader interaction
effects). All of these components combined in turn
influence downstream narrative empathy.
(1) narrative transportation, measured by the Trans-
portation Scale Short-Form / TS-SF (Appel et al.,
2015; Walkington et al., 2020) , (2) prior experi-
ence, measured by a Likert scale of how much the
reader believes they have been in a similar situa-
tion as the narrator, and (3) perceived similarity to
the narrator, measured by the Perceived Relational
Diversity Scale (Clark, 2002). These features allow
us to better understand the pathways via how narra-
tive style elements interplay with narrative-reader
interactions to lead to downstream empathy.
Reader Characteristics We collect reader char-
acteristics based on comprehensive literature re-
view of properties that are related to empathy.
These features include (1) the emotional state of the
reader before reading the story, measured by the
arousal/valence scale (Roshanaei et al., 2019), (2)
basic demographic information including age, gen-
der, ethnicity (Christov-Moore et al., 2014; Michal-
ska et al., 2013; O’brien et al., 2013), (3) how of-
ten participants read for pleasure (Koopman, 2015;
Mar et al., 2006), and (4) trait empathy, measured
by the Single Item Trait Empathy Scale / SITES
(Konrath et al., 2018) and the Toronto Empathy
Questionnaire / TEQ (Spreng et al., 2009). Prolific
automatically provides additional demographic in-
formation on participants such as fluent languages,
nationality, and employment and student status.
8 Empirical Insights on Narrative
Empathy
Next, we demonstrate the efficacy of our taxonomy
in exploring empirical questions around empathy
with a relevant subset of features from our dataset.
Narrative Style Affects Empathy First, we ag-
gregate empathy ratings for each story by takingFigure 4: Structural equation modeling of how narrative style elements lead to narrative transportation, combined
with effects of the reader sharing a similar experience with the narrator and the reader’s baseline trait empathy.
Figure 5: Comparing average empathy across high vs
low presence of each narrative feature, we show that
there are significant increases in empathy for stories
with more character development and plot volume.
the mean across the 3 raters. Then, we split sto-
ries into high vs. low presence of each narrative
feature and apply Mann-Whitney u-tests to the aver-
aged state empathy for the stories. Figure 5 shows
thathigh aggregated empathy stories have more
character development and plot volume. These
results are statistically significant, after applying
Benjamini-Hochberg correction to account for nine
comparisons ( p= 0.03for character development,
p= 0.03for plot trajectory).
Our work is, to the best of our knowledge, the
first to empirically test the effect of character de-
velopment and plot volume on narrative empathy.
While some prior works (van Krieken et al., 2017)
propose narrative features that relate to character
identification, these are lower level than charac-
ter development, such as the flatness/roundness or
vulnerability of a character. Our findings regard-
ing plot volume are in line with prior works that
discuss how salient plot events can mark impor-
tant moments in narratives that influence the emo-
tional impact of the story (Sap et al., 2022). Prior
works primarily from narrative studies use hand-
crafted features on smaller story sets (Fernandez-
Quintanilla, 2020; Eekhof et al., 2023), but do notfind significant effects of narrative features such
as viewpoint and foregrounding. These studies fo-
cus primarily on literary texts rather than narratives
that are more common online, and do not take into
account other aspects of narrative style and narra-
tive traits that are a part of our theorized taxonomy.
These findings suggest future focused works, for
example looking at how narrative style relates to
empathy across narrative forms (literary vs. per-
sonal stories, spoken vs. textual, etc.)
Narrative Empathy is not “One Size Fits All”
While our previous analysis captures aggregated
empathy, different people can have diverse emo-
tional reactions to the same story. In Figure 6 (Ap-
pendix B), we show the standard deviations in state
empathy scores for the same story, finding that on
average this std. dev. is significantly greater than
zero ( p < 0.001), indicating that the same nar-
rative can evoke different levels of empathy. To
address within-subject variance, we fit mixed ef-
fects models of empathy ratings using demographic
groups, grouping individuals of similar Age, Sex,
Trait Empathy, and Ethnicity and conditioning on
multiple ratings for a single story. We find through
a likelihood ratio test that empathy predicted by
demographic group results in significantly better
model fit ( p= 0.002). These two results indi-
cate that there is high variance in empathy for the
same story and that incorporating information re-
garding diverse demographic profiles can improve
empathy model fit, aligning with prior works (Au-
gust et al., 2020). Our findings have implications
in broader empathy prediction tasks within NLP
(Buechel et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2020), which
often optimize for a single objective empathy score
assigned to a piece of text, aggregating empathy
which can overlook individual factors.Vivid Emotional Expression of Narratives Leads
to Narrative Empathy Given our finding that
narrative empathy is not “one size fits all,” we con-
duct analyses taking into account random effects
for each story ID with structural equation model-
ing using the semopy library6. Structural equa-
tion modeling (SEM) is a standard social science
method for structured hypothesis testing and uses
a formulation of generalized linear models to ac-
count for fixed and random effects when a theoreti-
cal model with relationships between elements is
proposed.
From our SEM results (Figure 4), we find that
vividness of emotions significantly impacts nar-
rative transportation, which in turn influences
downstream empathy towards the story. The
importance of vividness of emotions in personal
stories is supported by other work in psychology.
In particular, Pillemer (1992) elaborates that vivid
descriptions of emotion in personal stories can con-
vey believability in the experience, more readily
evoking empathetic responses. While some compu-
tational works explore impact of narrative features
on empathy (Roshanaei et al., 2019), they typically
focus on positive/negative emotion words, rather
than the narrative style or way in which emotions
are conveyed through text, and may be better cap-
tured by current large-language models.
Figure 4 shows how narrative features contribute
to narrative transportation, leading to downstream
empathy and taking into account non-stylistic fac-
tors like the reader sharing a similar experience as
the narrator and the reader’s trait empathy level.
We find that both the narrator’s previous expe-
rience with something happening in the story as
well as their baseline trait empathy are signif-
icant predictors of empathy towards the story,
but not as much as narrative transportation. In
particular, our findings are in line with appraisal
theory that suggests that feeling similar emotions
is predicated on the target sharing similar expe-
riences (Wondra and Ellsworth, 2015; Yang and
Jurgens, 2024). While it is not particularly surpris-
ing that similar experience correlates with empa-
thy, very few works have looked at narrative style
interactions in tandem with fixed (trait empathy)
and more dynamic traits (experiencing something
similar), suggesting more holistic consideration of
contextual factors related to narrative empathy.
6https://semopy.com/Narrative Style Preferences in Relation to Empa-
thy are Personalized Finally, we show different
demographic profiles might prefer different ways of
telling a story, where preference is gauged by nar-
rative empathy. Adding the interaction term TRAIT
EMPATHY ×VIVIDNESS OF EMOTIONS to our
structural model, we find a significant interaction
effect of vivid emotions on the state empathy (est
=0.252,p <0.001). This indicates that the rela-
tionship between vividness of emotions and state
empathy increases as trait empathy increases,
suggesting that narrative style preferences are
personalized across demographic profiles.
While certainly not exhaustive, our empirical
analyses show how HEART can be used to yield
interesting behavioral insights around how narra-
tive style contributes to empathy. In particular, we
note that looking at personalization in narrative
empathy, as well as contextualizing reader factors
such as their trait empathy level are important for
empathy prediction, and are often overlooked in
existing empathy tasks.
9 Conclusion
In this work, we quantify narrative style as it relates
to narrative empathy. We introduce HEART , the
first theory-driven taxonomy delineating elements
of narrative style that can evoke empathy towards a
story. We evaluate the performance of LLMs in ex-
tracting narrative elements from HEART , showing
that prompting GPT-4 with our taxonomy leads to
reasonable, human-level annotations beyond what
prior lexicon-based methods can do, but that LLMs
struggle in specific tasks, such as GPT-4’s limited
ability to extract expressions of cognition and eval-
uations. Through a crowdsourced study with over
2,000 participants, we demonstrate how HEART
can be used to empirically understand the empathic
role of narrative style factors. We find that vivid-
ness of emotions expressed, character development
and plot volume are related to narrative empathy,
and contextual factors such as a person’s baseline
trait empathy or sharing an experience with the nar-
rator contribute to these effects. Additionally, we
show that empathy responses are highly variable
even in the same story, and that narrative style pref-
erences are personalized to people with different
demographic profiles (such as varying levels of trait
empathy). Our findings show the promise of using
LLMs for annotating complex story features that
can yield interesting social and behavioral insights.Limitations
Narrative Style Annotation While most of the
features in our taxonomy yielded reasonable con-
sistency across human and LLM annotators, a few
elements such as bodily perception and evaluations
were less consistent. We excluded these features
from our empirical analysis, but future work could
make improvements to the annotation process for
these specific elements. For example, our code-
book makes use of Likert scale ratings for each
of the narrative features within an entire story, but
more granular annotations such as frequency of
occurrences may have more consistency.
Empirical Study Size and Reproducibility
Findings in human behavior should be reproducible
across different populations and contexts. While
we conducted a large scale study with many partic-
ipants, we did not ask participants to rate multiple
stories. Additionally, the demographic distribution
of Prolific crowdworkers is predominantly white.
Future work should aim to reproduce our empiri-
cal insights with diverse populations and different
types of stories.
Statistical Modeling Our analysis methods in-
volve interpretable statistical models commonly
used in social science research. We chose to use
structural equation modeling to gauge behavioral
insights around how narrative style contributes to
empathy, rather than achieving the best perfor-
mance on narrative empathy prediction. Future
work could improve upon narrative empathy pre-
diction by incorporating narrative features in more
complex transformer-based models and ablating
different features.
Ethical Considerations
Personal stories can contain intimate and vulnera-
ble information, in addition to inducing emotions
in readers. Our study protocol for showing sensi-
tive stories to crowdworkers was approved by our
institution’s ethics review board as an exempt study.
Participants gave informed consent that their survey
ratings would be collected via Prolific. We ensured
that all datasets we used were also collected via
IRB-approved protocols, and will only distribute
our dataset to IRB-approved protocols.
More broadly, our work aims to advance re-
search in narrative analysis as it relates to real-
world human outcomes, such as empathy. Ourfindings corroborate that empathy is a highly per-
sonalized and contextualized experience. As such,
in future work, we find that, rather than modeling
the average person, it is important to value the rich
diversity of human experiences.
We recognize the ethical implications of model-
ing empathy in stories is double-edged. Empathy
can be used in persuasion, marketing, or emotional
manipulation. We encourage the findings from our
work, and future work on narrative empathy anal-
ysis, to focus on improving human empathy for
social good. For example, one could develop in-
teractive tools to help a user convey a story more
empathetically through understanding the role of
narrative devices in reader empathy. Or one could
use these insights to understand, at scale, social
patterns behind storytelling, and how these might
drive empathetic shifts online.

B Distribution of Empathy Standard
Deviation
C Codebook and LLM Prompts
C.1 Character development
We define character development in terms of
changes that a character undergoes through the
course of narrative events.
We define changes broadly to include cognitive,
emotional, behavioral, spiritual, moral, bodily, and
social changes.
Notably, we do not consider environmental
changes for characters sufficient for character de-
velopment, but acknowledge that other types of
change (e.g. emotional, social) often accompany
or are caused by environmental changes.
Figure 6: Distribution of standard deviation in empathy
scores for the same story indicate that empathy can
differ drastically for the same story.
Rate the narrator’s character development based
on the following scale:
• 1 - no change
• 2 - limited change
• 3 - moderate change
• 4 - significant change
• 5 - life-altering, dramatic change
Examples:
•I watched the birds splashing in the puddle
from a bench at the park. They were so playful
and content, even as it started to drizzle. (1 -
character does not change)
•It wasn’t until my brother told me what he’s
been going through that I realized how distant
I had been. I broke down in front of him at the
time. From that day forward, I decided to be
there for my family, no matter what–even if
that meant quitting my job and moving home.
(5 - multiple dramatic changes)
Respond with a single integer.
Story: [STORY]
C.2 Character vulnerability
Rate how emotionally vulnerable the narrator is in
telling their story. We define vulnerability as how
personal or intimate the information shared by the
narrator is.
Use the following scale:• 1 - not vulnerable at all
• 2 - somewhat vulnerable
• 3 - very vulnerable
Examples:
•But I just doubt myself a lot. It’s inevitable.
(3 - the author reveals their self doubt)
•I went on a very memorable trip to Crater
Lake Oregon on July 8th. (1 - does not share
any sensitive information)
Respond with a single integer.
Story: [STORY]
C.3 Optimistic tone
Rate the level of optimistic/pessimistic tone in the
narrator’s story. This should be the tone from the
narrator’s perspective, not of other characters in the
story.
• -2 - very pessimistic
• -1 - somewhat pessimistic
• 0 - neutral
• 1 - somewhat optimistic
• 2 - very optimistic
Examples:
•I feel alone. It is so frustrating. I used to
be fine with it, but then for some reason I
actually started wanting to have a friend. I
have nobody. And nobody around me seems
interesting enough to me. Life gets boring.
And frustrating. (rating = -2, very pessimistic)
•He is grown up and I have done my job to
get him out into the world. I will miss his
teenage years (somewhat), but I am proud of
him. (rating = 2, very optimistic)
Respond with a single integer.
Story: [STORY]
C.4 Vivid emotions
Rate the vividness of emotions described in the
story. For example, vividness can be characterized
by metaphor, simile, imagery, or strong language.
Use the following scale:
• 1 - not vivid at all• 2 - somewhat vivid

cesses are in the story. We define descriptions of
cognitive processes as statements that reveal the
mental state or thinking pattern of the narrator.
Use the following scale:
• 1 - minimal or no cognitive processes
•2 - moderate prominence of cognitive pro-
cesses
• 3 - high prominence of cognitive processes

Story: [STORY]
C.6 Temoral references
Rate the extent to which the character focuses on
the past (such as expressing nostalgia or reflections
on memories) vs on the future (anticipation, look-
ing forward) in the context of the story.
Note that we are not asking whether the story
is a past-tense, present-tense, or future-tense story.
We are concerned with the orientation the narratorhas toward the past, present, or future. We define
‘extent’ as the amount of narration time oriented
toward the relative past, present, or future.
Use the following scale:
• -2 - heavy focus on the past
• -1 - light focus on the past
• 0 - focus on the present
• 1 - light focus on the future
• 2 - heavy focus on the future
Examples:
•“I was stuck in bureaucratic processes for a
year, and the whole time I was dreaming of the
day my application processing was complete.”
(2)
•“I went to the mall and saw a parade on my
way.” (0)
•“When I started taking my test, I regretted how
little I had studied.” (-1)

C.7 Plot volume
Stories are structured by a sequence of events.
We define plot trajectory as the amount and sig-
nificance of events in the story.
If the events are banal or insignificant and do
not have a big impact on characters, then the plot
trajectory is relatively small. If the events signifi-
cantly impact characters or setting, then the story
has a large plot trajectory.
Rate the degree to which characters and setting
are transformed through the course of the story
based on the following scale:
• 1 - no change
• 2 - trivial change
• 3 - moderate change
• 4 - significant change
• 5 - life-altering, dramatic change
Examples:
•I stared out the window absent-mindedly for
three hours. It was a lovely day. (1)•I heard a crash outside. I ran outside to see
what had happened. It turned out the wind
had blown over a box of garden tools. (3)
•After a long and difficult pregnancy, I gave
birth to a beautiful baby at 4:15pm. It was
a crazy day at the hospital, but thanks to my
family and the medical staff, we got through
it! (5)
Respond with a single integer.

C.8 Emotion shifts
Most (but not all) emotions have either a positive
(high) or negative (low) valence.
For example, “anger” and “disgust” are low va-
lence, whereas “happy” and “content” are high
valence.
Other emotions like “ambivalent” or “surprised”
could be neutral, low, high, or ambiguous depend-
ing on the context.
We consider 5 different types of emotional shifts
that can occur in a story:
• low-to-high valence (e.g. sad to happy)
• high-to-low valence (e.g. happy to sad)
• high-to-high valence (e.g. happy to hopeful)
• low-to-low valence (e.g. sad to angry)
•ambiguous-to-any valence (e.g. bittersweet to
excited)
We are interested in relatively straightforward
emotion shifts that are either explicitly asserted in
the text or easily inferrable based on information in
the text. We are less interested in extremely subtle
emotional shifts (e.g. joyful to content).
Rate the degree of emotional shifts in the story
below.
Use the following scale:
• 1 - no emotional shifts
• 2 - limited or trivial emotional shifts
• 3 - moderate emotional shifts
• 4 - significant emotional shifts
• 5 - life-altering, dramatic emotional shifts
Example Story:•“I went to college for 1 year before dropping
out.” (1)
•“I was surprised to see my friend show up at
the cafe where I was working” (2)
•“I was frustrated with Ben for not inviting me,
but when I ran into him a few weeks later, our
conversation went fine.” (3)
•“I worked hard all semester and was mentally
and physically exhausted by the end. It was
such a relief to see my grades come in and see
that all of my hard work paid off.” (4)
•“I was so excited to get out of class but before
the bell rang the principal called me to his
office. I was in trouble. I was stressed out of
my mind walking to his office, but when I got
there, he gave me the good news: I won the
school-wide design contest!” (5)

Story: [STORY]
C.9 Resolution
In the course of events and interactions between
characters, stories introduce conflict. Stories also
raise questions about the motives of characters, the
meaning of events, and more. Conflict can be ex-
plicitly or implicitly referenced by narrators. Al-
ternatively, the reader may subjectively perceive
conflict in the situations described by narrators.
Resolution refers to the extent to which conflict
is addressed and questions are answered by the end
of the story. There are many ways a story may be
resolved, partially or completely. Resolution can
occur for the narrator, characters within the story,
or the reader.
A story with low resolution may not have much
conflict or leave conflict unaddressed by the end of
the story. A story with high resolution will involve
conflict that is addressed or raise questions that are
ultimately answered.
Rate the degree of resolution by the end of the
story based on the following scale:
• 1 - no resolution
• 2 - limited resolution
• 3 - moderate resolution
• 4 - significant resolution
• 5 - complete resolutionExamples:
•I couldn’t believe that he didn’t apologize.
How can someone just pretend that nothing
happened? (1)
•I was homeless and finally found a new job,
but I hate it and want to find a new one. (3)
•I looked for love my entire life, and had almost
given up, when I met them. Now I couldn’t
be more in love. (5)
Respond with a single integer. Do not include
any words or punctuation marks in your answer.
Story: [STORY]
C.10 Vividness of setting
Rate the vividness of the setting described in the
story. For example, vividness can be characterized
by metaphor, simile, imagery, or strong language.
Examples:
•I went to the restaurant to grab a bite to eat.
(1)
•The sun cast warm rays onto the concrete in
the park. (3)
•The waves in Palos Verdes crashed against the
shore, making beautiful ribbons (3)
•There was a house, with music playing in it
(2)
• 1 - not vivid at all
• 2 - somewhat vivid

Yeah, so this is the beginning of the school
year, and I’ve seen a lot of people moving into
their dorms and apartments, and it really got me
thinking about when I first went to College, whenI was moving into the dorm. How excited my
parents were for me and scared. And I was both
excited and scared, moving away from home and
my parents, and knowing that I’d probably get
really homesick. Watching all those kids moving
in really made me think about how that felt for
me. It was really important for me, there was a lot
of pressure for me to do well in College because
my dad came here from a developing country
and wasn’t able to get an education past second
grade. I was the first person in my family to go
to College, and to make it that far. So I had a lot
of emotions, definitely some anxiety, some stress
about the pressure of performing and doing well.
But also the excitement, and kind of the normal
fear that you get doing something you’ve never
done before and not having parents who had never
experienced College like that before. I didn’t really
have anyone to go to, to understand what that
meant, like what to expect. So watching those kids
just brought me back to that moment.

When covid first hit I had to move from my city
to my home town. Wasn’t a huge deal as it was for
others. It was a year and a half and a lot happened
and eventually I came back to my original town,
new fiance and cat in tow. I couldn’t find a job
once I came back and when I did that place got shut
down. My fiance did have one, but any paycheck he
had didn’t go to our shared place, mostly his phone
bill or groceries once in a while, while he stayed
out till 2 am drinking. So I started. Excessively.
I don’t know now how I did, it was only a few
months ago, how I managed to. I borrowed from
family or friends, I took out loans to make sure rent
was paid. It got so bad I was hospitalized for two
weeks because for over a day I was throwing up
every hour. I had torn my esophagus. No food. My
fiance didn’t visit, saying he was scared, but his
aunt visited. I cried every night.
When I got home he was working, he came back
and was clearly drinking. The next day my mother
texted me telling me she was disappointed in me
drinking so much I got myself in that situation. I
saw that and realized when I was in the hospital,
alone, afraid, and not wanting to live like this. Thus
me and my mother didn’t speak for months.
Family stuff happened, got back in touch. We
both never apologized but there’s a whole lot ofcans there to be opened. I ruined relationships I
can’t take back. Lost contact with friends.
After this stint my anxiety has been on high alert,
making it hard for me to eat or even drink water.
Public transit has been scary as I do have those
impulse "what if I ran on the track" thoughts which
I know are ridiculous.
Thankfully now I do have a job I enjoy, I have
my cat, my own place I pay rent.

About four months ago, my wife and I sold our
first family home. We have a large family. It is my
wife and I plus five children. Our oldest daughter
started asking us about having her own room. Al-
though we loved that house, we knew it was time
to get something bigger.
Luckily, we sold it after being on the market
for only three days. We found a house with more
bedrooms quickly, and the whole process was as
smooth as it could have been.
However, it is bittersweet looking back on every-
thing. That house was very special to me. I did a
lot of work on it. I saw my children grow and learn
and love there. We made so many good memories.
We charted how our children grew on a closet door
(which is probably still there). It was a wonderful
house while it lasted, but things happen and we had
to let it go.
As of today, I can still remember every little
nook and cranny of that place. After all, it has only
been a few months. However, it is sad to think
these memories will eventually fade.
I love our new house, but that first one will
always hold a special place in my heart.

A couple months ago my younger brother got
married. I traveled back to my home town of St.
Louis, Missouri for the event. I took my girlfriend
along with me. It was her first trip to my home
town ever. The trip started out great, we picked up
our rental car and went to grab a pizza.
The following day was my brother’s wedding
ceremony. We thought it had all been planned
out thoroughly, but it turns out that nobody had
checked the weather report. The day of the wed-
ding came, it started out sunny, a hot day in lateJuly. Clear blue skies and not a cloud to be seen.
We were all so optimistic about the big day. The
ceremony was scheduled for 6 PM at sunset, so it
would start to cool down and allow for some re-
prieve from the heat of the day. In theory, that was
a great idea.
However, when my girlfriend and I pulled out
of the driveway we noticed something new that we
hadn’t seen yet on the trip. Storm clouds moving
in fast, and lots of them. Dark gray giants rose
onto the horizon at a frightening pace. Lightning
was visible in the distance as we began our drive
to the wedding venue. We hoped and prayed that
the storm would blow the other way, and that the
outdoor wedding venue would be spared from this
particular storm. Would we be able to get away
with having the ceremony in decent weather?
It became a race with time. As we drove to
the wedding ceremony, it felt as though the clouds
were following us and growing larger. As we ar-
rived, I greeted my brother in the parking lot and
asked if he thought it would rain. He said maybe,
it depends how fast we can get this done. Every-
one was present except for the minister, one of the
few people who was completely essential to the
process.
As the minister arrived, it finally began to
rain. It was raining on my brother’s wedding day,
I couldn’t believe it, but luckily the ceremony
was completed and we had a wonderful sunny
reception the next day.

I was hiking near Lake Ontario with my partner
and our two grandkids. It was a beautiful sunny
day. The lake sparkled brilliantly. I have a bad
knee, so I was struggling with some of the physical
activity. My partner suggested that I rest a bit on a
fallen log. I was nervous, because I would not be
able to get up by myself, but I agreed.
My partner and my granddaugther wanted to
hike further to see the bluffs. I said I would be OK
for a bit, but my sweet grandson insisted on staying
with me. He said, "I won’t let my granny sit in the
forest all alone."
Well it was a good thing. My partner and grand-
daughter didn’t return in a reasonable amount of
time. We got very nervous! My grandson is 10
years old, but not strong enough to help me up. He
searched for a stout walking stick and found onenearby. I used it to prop myself up, and managed
to get my feet underneath me.
Together we went down the shore to find the rest
of our party. Luckily all was well, but I would truly
have been distraught if I had been all alone waiting
for so long!

I’ve been hearing a lot of people saying that MIT
students aren’t successful as Stanford or Harvard
students because there aren’t as many well-known
MIT CEOs. It seems rather unfair of them to say
that because MIT students have contributed a lot to
this world from nobel-prize winning theorems to
groundbreaking algorithms.
Also there are lot of MIT grads like David Siegel
who went on to found great companies that don’t
necessarily have a face to the brand like Jobs’ Ap-
ple or Zuckerberg’s Facebook. And on top of that,
there many of MIT grads who go on to be CTOs
or other types of product managers (sorry for the
emphasis on course 6), and without them, the com-
panies would not be the same.
Above all, out of the "top" institutions, MIT does
the most to help lower-income students attain social
and economic mobility (I remember reading an
article, but can’t find the link).
This is not to say that MIT doesn’t have prob-
lems, but at the end of the day, I wish people didn’t
equate fame/status with success. You don’t have to
be a famous CEO or a CEO in general to be success-
ful. And I’m sure a lot of the people I mentioned
didn’t end up becoming crazy famous because they
value privacy, which is fine!
And a lot of alumns end up doing what they’re
interested in regardless of status, which is amazing
and also indicative of success! Success can look
different for people.

Today was one of the saddest days of my life. It
started early in the day, and my parents came by
and picked me up at my house. Everyone was in
a very somber mood, but it was sunny and quite
warm. We drove out to a church about thirty min-
utes away near where my mom grew up, and while
driving I couldn’t help but think back to all the
good memories I had with my cousin. She was
always so happy and nice and just fun to be around.
But now, that was all gone, and all I had were the
memories that were going over in my mind.
Arriving at the church and seeing all of my fam-
ily, it was hard. It was just so sad, all of it. Seeing
my aunt was the hardest part I think, but I knew
then that she was strong and was going to be able
to get past this. My uncle is an ordained pastor, so
he was able to help with the service and I think that
helped ease some of the pain.
After the service we all went to the cemeteryand gathered up on the hill in the shade. Seeing
the final resting place really hit me hard, I started
to cry much harder than I had been all day at that
point. All of the memories and the final shock to
my brain that she was never coming back, made
me very sad, and made me miss her dearly.
We then all met at a local place where they
served a late lunch and we had some drinks. It was
good to see so many of my family, but at the same
time, so sad, because I thought that we shouldn’t
be seeing each other, at least not for this reason.
I didn’t really know how to feel when we left and
I made it back home. I was deeply saddened, and
just thought of how my aunt, uncle, and cousins
felt. I know that life had changed for them forever,
and now life was starting again without their dear
one, and that hurt me again. But my family is
strong, and stronger together, and I know we will
get through this like we will any other tragedy that
comes our way.
