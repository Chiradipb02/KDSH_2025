Abstract
Large language models are susceptible to jail-
break attacks, which can result in the genera-
tion of harmful content. While prior defenses
mitigate these risks by perturbing or inspect-
ing inputs, they ignore competing objectives,
the underlying cause of alignment failures. In
this paper, we propose Alignment-Enhanced
Decoding (AED), a novel defense that employs
adaptive decoding to address the root causes of
jailbreak issues. We first define the Competitive
Index to quantify alignment failures and utilize
feedback from self-evaluation to compute post-
alignment logits. Then, AED adaptively com-
bines Competitive Index and post-alignment
logits with the original logits to obtain harm-
less and helpful distributions. Consequently,
our method enhances safety alignment while
maintaining helpfulness. We conduct exper-
iments across five models and four common
jailbreaks, with the results validating the effec-
tiveness of our approach. Code is available at

1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
being applied across various domains (Bommasani
et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2023). Given the malicious
content in pre-training datasets, alignments are im-
plemented to ensure these models are helpful and
harmless. (Penedo et al., 2023; Ouyang et al.,
2022; Liu et al., 2020). Despite efforts in align-
ment, jailbreak attacks can circumvent safety mea-
sures, resulting in undesirable outcomes (Zou et al.,
2023; Liu et al., 2023a; Chao et al., 2023; Zhou
et al., 2024).
Current defenses against jailbreaks primarily in-
volve perturbation of jailbreaks or detecting the
safety of inputs. Perturbation defenses focus on
countering jailbreak attacks through input modifica-
tion. (Jain et al., 2023; Robey et al., 2023; Liu et al.,

2024; Wei et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Detec-
tion method aims to inspect and categorize input as
harmful or safe content, such as perplexity-based
classification (Alon and Kamfonas, 2023; Jain
et al., 2023; Phute et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2023).
However, existing defenses lack efficiency be-
cause they ignore the underlying causes of jail-
breaks. One explanation for alignment failure is the
presence of competing objectives outlined by Wei
et al. (2024). Competing objectives arise when
there is a balance between helpful performance

and adhering to harmless principles. This competi-
tion may cause a model to prioritize helpful objec-
tives over harmless when confronted with jailbreak
prompts, leading to the failure of safety measures.
In this work, we present Alignment-Enhanced
Decoding (AED) , a novel defense that employs
adaptive decoding to refine the probability distri-
bution of each token (see Fig.2). Specifically, we
define the Competitive Index to quantify the com-
peting objectives of the model and to represent the
risk of the model being jailbroken. Subsequently,
we obtain the self-evaluation of the model in which
we use the generated output as an auxiliary input to
derive the post-alignment logits. When predicting
the next token, AED adaptively refines the origi-
nal logits based on the Competitive Index and the
post-alignment logits. Therefore, AED ensures that
each step of the decoding process adheres to harm-
less goals without additional training. In addition,
AED is adaptive to maintain the helpfulness to rou-
tine queries.
We perform comprehensive experiments across
five popular open-source large language models,
including Llama2-7B-Chat-HF (Touvron et al.,
2023), Llama3-8B-Instruct (Meta, 2024), Vicuna-
7B (Chiang et al., 2023), Guanaco-7B (Dettmers
et al., 2024), and Gemma-1.1-7B-IT (Team et al.,2024). Experimental results show that AED effec-
tively counters a range of sophisticated jailbreak
attacks such as GCG (Zou et al., 2023) , Auto-
Dan (Liu et al., 2023a), ICD (Wei et al., 2023), and
Refusal_Suppression (Wei et al., 2024). Addition-
ally, AED maintains helpfulness on general queries
in harmless datasets, including MMLU (Hendrycks
et al., 2020a), GMS8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), and Al-
paca (for Research on Foundation Models, 2023).
To summarize our contributions:
•We define the Competitive Index to quantify
the risk of the model being compromised by
jailbreak attacks.
•We propose the Alignment-Enhanced Decod-
ing (AED) , a novel decoding-based defense
enhancing model alignment.
•We conduct extensive experiments on five
models, four jailbreak attacks, and three harm-
less datasets. The results of empirical experi-
ments demonstrate the effectiveness of Candi-
date Count.

Alignment. Incorporating vast amounts of data
from the internet, datasets, such as MassiveText,
2contain elements of inconsistent quality (Rae et al.,
2021). When used for pre-training, these datasets
can cause models to deviate from safety stan-
dards (Hendrycks et al., 2020a; Brown et al.,
2020; Devlin et al., 2018). In this context, align-
ment becomes crucial, referring to the essential
calibration of pre-trained models to align with hu-
man values (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al.,
2022; Bai et al., 2022; Glaese et al., 2022).
Jailbreak Attacks. Despite efforts to enhance
alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks (Wolf et al., 2023),
where strategically crafted prompts can lead to the
generation of undesired outputs. The development
of jailbreak attacks has undergone an iterative pro-
gression, shifting from manually executed strate-
gies (Liu et al., 2023b; Perez and Ribeiro, 2022) to
more sophisticated automated methods (Zou et al.,
2023; Liu et al., 2023a).
Defenses. Large language models (LLMs) neces-
sitate robust defenses, which primarily manifest in
two forms: Perturbation ,Binary Classification .
Perturbation techniques modify the original in-
puts in ways that aim to compromise the integrity of
the attack. Jain et al.’s (2023) method of paraphras-
ing includes transformations at both the sentence
level and token level. Robey et al.’s (2023) perturba-
tion strategy involves randomly altering characters
within words at the character-level and voting for
responses from perturbed copies. Wei et al. (2023)
and Zhang et al. (2024) use prompts that include
standard question-and-answer interactions.
Binary classification tasks assess whether inputs
or outputs are harmful. One method involves us-
ing perplexity-based metrics to detect jailbreak
attacks (Alon and Kamfonas, 2023; Jain et al.,
2023; Zou et al., 2023). Large language mod-
els (LLMs) can be regarded as a binary classifier,
wherein the output is preceded by the query “Is it
harmful?” to elicit a classification response (Phute
et al., 2024). Kumar et al., 2023 proposed approach
involves employing an additional filter to scrutinize
every substring within a given sentence.
3 Competitive Index
The trade-offs between helpfulness and harmless-
ness objectives appear after language models are
trained to align human values (Wei et al., 2024).
When faced with ambiguous questions, these trade-
offs place the models at risk of choosing between

two distinct answers oriented to different objec-
tives. For instance, when an LLM is compromised
through a jailbreak attack, the candidate tokens may
include conflicting responses such as “Sure” and
“Sorry”. Consequently, these trade-offs become
vulnerabilities that can be exploited in jailbreak at-
tacks, such as Catastrophic jailbreak (Huang et al.,
2023). In the study by Wei et al. (2024), these trade-
offs were further discussed under the framework of
“Competing Objectives.”
Due to the Competing Objectives, both seman-
tically opposing candidate tokens increase when
applying Top-p sampling. Thus, it contributes to ex-
panding the candidate set Pcfrom both directions.
Examples are shown in Appendix C.
In Top-p sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019), given
the decoding step t, the candidate set Pc⊆ V is
defined as follows:
Pc= arg min
Pi∈P|Pi|, (1)
where
P=

PiX
x∈Pip(x|x0,···, xj−1)≥p0

.(2)
HereVis the vocabulary set, p(x|x0,···, xj−1)
denotes the probability of next token given a se-
quence of j−1tokens as context and p0∈(0,1]is
a threshold hyper-parameter. The size of candidate
setPcis defined as Candidate Count Sand is then
calculated as follows:
S=|Pc|. (3)
The variation of Sin harmless datasets tends to
be stable compared with encountering the jailbreak
3attacks, as illustrated in Appendix D. The upper
limit for Sin harmless datasets is then defined as
St∈N+and its calculation is as follows:
St= max
i=1{Si|Si∈ M} , (4)
where Mrepresents the set of Scalculated solely
based on the user’s input, as determined across
harmless samples for the given model.
The range of Svaries across the different lan-
guage models. Therefore, we propose a uniform
measurement scale Competitive Index I.
Definition of Competitive Index: Given on a lan-
guage model and a specific input, utilizing Can-
didate Count Sand a model-determined constant
value St, Competitive Index quantifies the compet-
ing objectives when the model predicts the next
token and is then calculated as follows:
I△=S
St, (5)
where I∈R+. An Itends to ∞, indicating
stronger competition and a higher risk of potential
jailbreak influence, while an Iclose to 0suggests
minimal competition and a reduced likelihood of
jailbreaks.
As illustrated in Fig.3, the Ican be differentiate
by a threshold It. The threshold Itis set 1, cor-
responding to the condition where S=St. An
Igreater than the threshold signals anomalies, in-
dicating the competition and an increased risk of
jailbreak influence.
4 Method: Alignment-Enhanced
Decoding
As discussed in Sec. 3, Competitive Index quan-
tifies the degree of the objectives competition
within the model. Based on Competitive Index,
we propose a novel defense method, Alignment-
Enhanced Decoding (AED). AED adaptively re-
fines the distribution of each generation step. As
a result, AED performs an enhanced alignment at
the decoding phase, illustrated in Fig.2.
4.1 Realigning Language Models through
Self-Evaluation
The language models can discern whether its gen-
eration is safe when encountering jailbreak attacks.
For instance, Self-Defense (Phute et al., 2023) asks
LLMs “Is it harmful?” to judge its generation.
Thus, we propose a novel method to dynamically
obtain the model’s self-evaluation at each decodingstep, which is formalized as the post-alignment log-
itsLpost. We detail the computation of the model’s
original logits Lmodel and post-alignment logits
Lpostas follows.
Decoder-only large language models (LLMs)
calculate the logits Lmodel∈R|V|for next token yn
through the following process:
Lmodel =LLM (yn|x1,···, xm, y1,···, yn−1),
(6)
where x1, x2,···, xmcorrespond to the user’s in-
put, and y1, y2,···, yn−1represents the genera-
tion of LLMs. To facilitate the self-evaluation, we
truncate the output and use it to derive the post-
alignment logits Lpost.
Lpost=LLM (yn|y1,···, yn−1), (7)
whereLpost∈R|V|. We prefix the “Assistant:” to
y1, y2,···, yn−1to avoid an empty input during
the initial generation of Lpost.
In summary, post-alignment logits represent the
model’s self-evaluation and are then used in the
adaptive algorithm.
4.2 Decoding with Adaptive Algorithm
As discussed in Sec.3, Competitive Index Ican
effectively reflect the competition when encoun-
tering jailbreaks. Based on Iand post-alignment
logitsLpost, we propose an adaptive algorithm to
refine the distribution by re-weighting the model’s
original logits Lmodel, which is outlined in Alg.1.
Specifically, we calculate the Imodel andIpost
based on Lmodel andLpost. Based on the Top-p
sampling and Eq.3, candidate set Pccan be deter-
mined by logits Land then be used to calculate
Candidate Count S. This process is defined as the
function fwhere S=f(L). As demonstrated in
Eq.5, Iis derived from the Candidate Count S:
Imodel =f(Lmodel)
St, (8)
Ipost=f(Lpost)
St. (9)
Then the tuning coefficient c∈(0,1)for two
logits is calculated as:
c=σ(St·(Imodel−Ipost−Bbias)), (10)
where σ(·)is the sigmoid function and bias Bbias∈
Rrefers a constant to determine the effect of Lpost.

When Bbiasgets larger, the effect of post-alignment
logits decreases and vice verse.
At decoding step t, based on the tuning coeffi-
cientcand post-alignment logits Lpost, the refined
logitsLAED∈R|V|for next token is calculated as :
LAED= (1−c)·Lmodel +c·Lpost. (11)
Given the refined logits LAED= (l1, l2, . . . , l N),
the refined distribution PAED= (p1, p2, . . . , p N),
is computed as follows:
pi=softmax (LAED)i=eli
PN
j=1elj, (12)
where i= 1,2, . . . , N .
When the input has a high Competitive Index,
an aligned candidate vwill exhibit an increased
probability after AED, which enhances the align-
ment. Assume at time stamp t, we have the model
logitsLmodel and post-alignment logits Lpost. For
candidate v, the value of it in two logits are L(v)

andL(v)

where ce<1. As discussed in Sec. 3, under jail-
breaks, an increased level of competition leads to a
rise in Imodel, which tends toward infinity. Conse-
quently, as specified in Eq.10, the tuning coefficient
capproaches 1. Thus, under jailbreak conditions, c
consistently exceeds ce, increasing the probability
of the aligned candidate v.
5 Experiments
In this study, we conducted extensive experiments
of AED across five models, utilizing four attack
methods. Then, we evaluated the performance of
AED on three harmless datasets.
5.1 Experimental Setups
Models. We employed AED on five popu-
lar open-source LLMs, including Llama2-7B-
Chat-HF (Touvron et al., 2023), Llama3-8B-
Instruct (Meta, 2024), Vicuna-7B (Chiang et al.,
2023), Guanaco-7B (Dettmers et al., 2024), and
Gemma-1.1-7B-IT (Team et al., 2023).
Datasets. As for the jailbreaks, we chose the four
datasets including GCG (Zou et al., 2023), Auto-
DAN (Liu et al., 2023a), ICA (Wei et al., 2023)
and Refusal_Suppression (Wei et al., 2024) and
followed their official settings. As for the control
group, we used AvdBench (Zou et al., 2023) as a
harmful benchmark. As for harmless datasets and
the calculation of St, we chose three popular bench-
marks including MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020b),
GMS8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), and Alpaca (Dubois
et al., 2024). We included 90 prompts for each
dataset to evaluate AED in this experiment.

(Perturbation) (Jain et al., 2023). As for the PPL
method, we followed Jain et al. (2023), and the
threshold settings are shown in Tab. 1. As for the
Self-Defense method, we used the attacked model
to defend itself. As for Re-tokenization, we set
the BPE-dropout rate as 0.4, which gains the best
performance in this method. As for the ICA attack,
we set the shot number as 1.
Metrics. To evaluate the effectiveness of defense
methods, the Rejection Rate (RR) is defined as:
RR= 1−ASR,
where the Attack Success Rate (ASR) follows the
definition by Zou et al. (2023). A higher ASR in-
dicates better performance. For harmless datasets,
the Not Rejection Rate (NRR) is assessed using:
NRR =Number of Not Rejected Responses
Total Queries.
This metric determines the likelihood that the lan-
guage model will erroneously refuse to answer
harmless inputs, where a lower percentage indi-
cates better performance. The criteria for classify-
ing “Rejected Responses” involves a keyword set
containing refusal strings, detailed in B. Regard-
ing time complexity, the methodology described
by Xu et al. (2024) is adopted, and the Average
Token Generation Time ratio (ATGR) is calculated
as follows:
ATGR =Avg. token gen. time w/ AED
Avg. token gen. time w/o AED.

zero, indicating a decrease in the degree of competition.
Competitive Index Changes Under Harmless
and Jailbreak Queries. Observations reveal that
the Competitive Index Iexhibits significant differ-
ences from harmless inputs under jailbreak attacks.
Specifically, Ioften reaches or exceeds a thresh-
old of two, contrasting sharply with its behavior
in harmless datasets, where values typically hover
around zero. This trend underscores a marked devi-
ation when the model is exposed to jailbreak inputs.
In the case of the Vicuna model under AutoDAN
attacks, the percentage of indices surpassing this
threshold reaches 82.73%. Additionally, most of
these capped entries constitute at least 37% of the
data, highlighting the index’s effectiveness in dis-
tinguishing between routine and harmful inputs.
Competitive Index Changes Under Different In-
put Settings. The Competitive Index Iis sensi-
tive to changes in input settings, such as the intro-
duction of system prompts. As depicted in Fig.5,
incorporating system prompts leads to a noticeable
decrease in the degree of competition. For example,
in the Llama2-7B-Chat-HF model under a GCG
attack (Zou et al., 2023), the proportion of Ivalues
exceeding the threshold stdecreases significantly
from 75.5% to 41.5% with the introduction of a sys-
tem prompt. This system prompt, standard in the
Llama2 configuration, states: “You are a chat as-
sistant designed to provide helpful and not harmful
responses to user queries.”
5.3 AED Enhances the Alignment.
We conducted a comparative analysis of Alignment-
Enhanced Decoding (AED) against other defense
methods as documented in Tab. 4. The step N
in Alg. 1 is set as 30. The results presented in
the table confirm that AED effectively withstands
attacks and outperforms other defense methods
across all tested scenarios, achieving superior out-
comes. Specifically, AED maintained or reacheddefense success rates near 100% for harmful bench-
mark and jailbreak scenarios, demonstrating its de-
fensive capability. Notably, AED achieved the best
results in scenarios such as the Llama2 model un-
der GCG attack with a 92.5% rejection rate and the
Gemma-1.1-7b-it model under AutoDAN attack
with a 34.0% rejection rate, outperforming other
methods such as PPL, Self-Defense, and Retok-
enization. These findings highlight AED’s consis-
tency in enhancing security across diverse model-
ing environments and provide substantial evidence
of its effectiveness against jailbreak attacks.
5.4 AED Maintains Helpfulness
We compared AED versus no-defense and Self-
Defense methods across various models, as docu-
mented in Tab. 3. This comparison focuses on the
Not Rejection Rate (NRR) in the MMLU, GMS8K,
and Alpaca datasets. The results, detailed in the
table, show that AED does not interfere with stan-
dard query processing. For instance, in the Llama2
model, the NRR changed minimally from 2.5% to
3.0% for MMLU, indicating that AED preserves
the model’s functionality. A notable performance
is observed in the Llama3, where the NRR for
the Alpaca dataset remained unchanged, affirming
that AED’s implementation does not degrade the
model’s responsiveness in control settings. These
findings affirm that AED can effectively be imple-
mented without altering the inherent functionality
of the models, thus ensuring their reliability in real-
world applications.
5.5 Time Overhead of AED
We evaluated AED alongside three defensive mech-
anisms across five models. Tab. 2 shows that AED
does not incur significant additional computational
costs. This assessment involved testing each de-
fense with ten jailbreak scenarios and ten harmless
queries. Notably, Competitive Index Iadaptively

refines only the first 30 tokens, minimizing poten-
tial impacts on processing efficiency.
In summary, these experiments establish that the
Competitive Index accurately measures the degree
of competition and is responsive to input variations.
Additionally, our findings confirm that AED effec-
tively defends against jailbreak attacks. It is also
demonstrated that AED does not compromise the
model’s efficacy in standard question-answering
tasks. Then, the ATGR suggests that AED intro-
duces minimal additional computational overhead.
6 Conclusions
We define the Competitive Index Ifor the first time
to quantify the degree of competition among var-
ious training objectives. Utilizing e Competitive
Index Iand the self-evaluation capabilities of the
model, we introduce a novel defensive AED that
adaptively refines the token distribution during pre-
diction. This method is validated across five differ-
ent models and tested against four jailbreak attacks,
confirming its efficacy. Through comparative stud-
ies, we demonstrate that AED surpasses existing
defenses in effectiveness and achieves this with-
out necessitating additional training. Furthermore,according to the Average Time Generation Ratio
(ATGR), AED introduces no significant increase in
time overhead, confirming its efficiency and practi-
cality.
7 Limitations
In this study, we differentiate between harmless
and jailbreak samples to analyze the Competitive
Index. However, we do not investigate why dispari-
ties in the index exist within jailbreak samples, with
some reaching up to 100 times the threshold. Fur-
thermore, variations in the index across different
models are noted but not extensively explored, sug-
gesting that model architecture and training data
may influence these differences. Future research
could further examine these factors to enhance un-
derstanding of the Competitive Index’s utility in
evaluating model performance.
8 Ethics Impact
This paper focuses on the domain of model security,
specifically addressing some underlying causes of
alignment failures and proposing effective defense
mechanisms against jailbreak attacks. While the
research inherently involves sensitive topics, in-
8cluding the potential generation of harmful con-
tent, we have taken rigorous measures to ensure
the ethical handling of such issues. Specifically,
the potentially harmful content discussed within
this study is abstracted or represented in alternative
ways; no explicit jailbreak attack prompts are dis-
played. By providing a robust defense method, this
research aims to enhance the security of large mod-
els, thereby contributing positively to the broader
field of AI safety and ensuring that the advance-
ments in language model capabilities do not com-
promise ethical standards.

B Keyword Sets
In order to assess whether Large language models
(LLMs) refuse to respond to jailbreak queries posed
by users, we have established keyword sets con-
sisting of predefined refusal strings. If an LLM’s
response includes any of these refusal strings, it
is considered to have successfully refused to an-
swer the malicious query, thereby effectively de-
fending against the jailbreak attack. Conversely,
if the response lacks any specified refusal strings,
it is deemed to have not refused the query. Thisapproach allows us to systematically evaluate the
model’s capability to identify and reject harmful
inputs.

C Increase of Candidates Count
Our observations indicate that when language mod-
els confront jailbreak attacks, the number of can-
didate words compared to responses to normal
queries increases significantly. Notably, this in-
crease includes both affirmative responses (repre-
sented in red) and refusals (represented in green).
The augmentation in both categories of candidate
words leads to an overall rise in the total number
of candidates. This phenomenon highlights the
model’s attempt to balance helpfulness and secu-
rity, reflecting its internal decision-making process
under challenging scenarios. The jailbreak content
is replaced with “!!!”. The details are shown in
Fig.6 and Fig.7.
D Candidate Count across Different
Models
This section presents data on the Candidate Count-
for the first token generated by various models
when faced with harmless and harmful inputs. The
behavior of these models under different input con-
ditions can provide insights into their initial reac-
tion and the inherent mechanisms that govern their
response strategies. The comparative analysis aims
to highlight the distinctions in how each model
processes and reacts to benign versus potentially
malicious queries.E Comparison with Other Baseline
In previous work, SafeDecoding (Xu et al., 2024)
also aimed to enhance model defense by improving
the decoding process. Unlike SafeDecoding, which
compares the probability distributions generated by
the original and fine-tuned models to select appro-
priate tokens, our method utilizes a newly designed
metric, the competitive index, to strengthen de-
fenses. We did not directly compare our approach
with SafeDecoding in the previous section because
our replicated results differed. When attacking the
Llama2 model with 50 AutoDAN samples and in-
creasing the maximum length to 512, our obtained
harm score was 3.92, not 1 (where 1 indicates no
harm and 5 indicates extreme harm). The reason
may stem from the original experiments not fully
accounting for the entire responses generated by
the model.
