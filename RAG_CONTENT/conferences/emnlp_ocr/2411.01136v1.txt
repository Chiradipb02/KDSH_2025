Abstract
Prior study shows that LLMs sometimes gener-
ate content that violates copyright. In this paper,
we study another important yet underexplored
problem, i.e., will LLMs respect copyright
information in user input, and behave ac-
cordingly? The research problem is critical,
as a negative answer would imply that LLMs
will become the primary facilitator and accel-
erator of copyright infringement behavior. We
conducted a series of experiments using a di-
verse set of language models, user prompts, and
copyrighted materials, including books, news
articles, API documentation, and movie scripts.
Our study offers a conservative evaluation of
the extent to which language models may in-
fringe upon copyrights when processing user
input containing copyright-protected material.
This research emphasizes the need for further
investigation and the importance of ensuring
LLMs respect copyright regulations when han-
dling user input to prevent unauthorized use or
reproduction of protected content. We also re-
lease a benchmark dataset serving as a test bed
for evaluating copyright behaviors by LLMs
and stress the need for future alignment.
1 Introduction
The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs),
powerful models that generate human-like text and
excel in various natural language processing tasks
(Khurana et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang
et al., 2022), has transformed the landscape of ar-
tificial intelligence. However, as LLMs become
more sophisticated and ubiquitous, concerns have
arisen regarding their potential to produce content
that violates copyright laws.
Previous research has primarily focused on in-
vestigating the occurrence of copyright violations
in the output generated by LLMs (Carlini et al.,
2021; Karamolegkou et al., 2023). While this line
of inquiry is crucial, it is equally important to ex-
amine another critical aspect: do LLMs know to

respect copyright information in user input and
adjust their behavior accordingly? We raise this
question by observing two prevalent use cases of
LLMs: (1)users input a private document and sub-
sequently ask questions or request task completion
based on the provided document, and (2)LLM
interfaces employ retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) techniques to retrieve relevant online text
to enhance and contextualize user prompts. What
if copyrighted material is involved in these use
cases? The research question is of vital impor-
tance because if LLMs fail to recognize and adhere
to copyright information provided by users, they
risk becoming the most significant incubators and
facilitators of copyright infringement. Such a sce-
nario would not only undermine the integrity of
the creative industry but also raise serious ethical
and legal concerns surrounding the use of LLMs.
Figure 1 illustrates a few examples that highlight
the potential consequences of LLMs disregardingarXiv:2411.01136v1  [cs.CL]  2 Nov 2024copyright information in user input.
This paper seeks to shed light on this critical
problem by conducting a comprehensive analysis
of how LLMs handle copyrighted content provided
by users. By examining the behavior of LLMs in
response to user input containing copyright notices,
disclaimers, and other relevant information, we aim
to uncover whether these models are equipped to re-
spect and act upon such information appropriately.
The findings of this research will contribute to the
ongoing discourse on the responsible development
and deployment of LLMs, and provide valuable
insights for stakeholders involved in the creation,
regulation, and use of these powerful tools. The
code and data used in this work will be released.1
Our main contributions are as follows:
•We propose a research problem of whether
LLMs respect copyright information in user in-
put and behave accordingly, which is important
yet less studied. Moreover, we create a bench-
mark dataset consisting of 43,200 simulated user
queries, covering various aspects of copyright.
•We conduct extensive experiments on multiple
popular LLMs and show that many popular
LLMs do not respect copyright information in
the user input. We also provide analysis and in-
sights concerning the different types of copyright
notices and query framings.
•We explore two simple but effective query modi-
fication methods that help mitigate LLMs’ viola-
tion of copyright, and we show their benefits are
accumulative when combined.
2 Background and Motivation
2.1 Protecting Intellectual Property Rights in
the Era of LLM
The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of
large language models (LLMs) have transformed
various language-related tasks (Yuan et al., 2022;
Basyal and Sanghvi, 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Wit-
teveen and Andrews, 2019), offering unprece-
dented opportunities for innovation. However,
these developments have also raised concerns about
the potential infringement of intellectual property
rights, particularly in terms of copyright violations
and plagiarism. As LLMs continue to evolve, it is
crucial to address these challenges through ongoing
research efforts and the establishment of appropri-
ate legal frameworks. This paper aims to provide
a quantitative benchmark for assessing the LLMs’
1https://github.com/liamjxu/copyrightbehavior given copyright information, bridging the
gap between content creators, legal experts, and
LLM developers.
2.2 Related Work on Copyright vs LLM
Researchers and industry leaders have placed sig-
nificant emphasis on protecting the intellectual
property rights associated with the weight parame-
ters of LLMs (Peng et al., 2023; Xue et al., 2021).
This focus is driven by the resource-intensive na-
ture of large model training and the need to pre-
vent the unauthorized use of these powerful tools
(Zhang et al., 2018; He et al., 2022; Dale, 2021).
LLMs possess the capability to memorize and
reproduce extensive segments of their training data,
which may include copyrighted text and sensitive
information (Karamolegkou et al., 2023; Carlini
et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2023; Carlini et al., 2022;
Kandpal et al., 2022). This memorization poten-
tial raises critical copyright infringement concerns,
especially as models scale up in size and data ca-
pacity (Carlini et al., 2021; Ozdayi et al., 2023;
Chao et al., 2023), or under extraction attack (Ishi-
hara, 2023). Some innovative methodologies like
“copyright traps” (Shilov et al., 2024; Shi et al.,
2023; Meeus et al., 2024) have been developed
to detect copyrighted content in LLMs’ training
data. More experiments have examined the extent
to which LLMs can generate verbatim copyrighted
content (Liang et al., 2022) and quantified the asso-
ciated legal risks using metrics that capture exact
and near-exact reproduction (Carlini et al., 2021;
Lee et al., 2022). In addition, the pervasiveness of
copyright concerns extends beyond a single modal-
ity, encompassing multiple forms of digital content
creation, such as text, scripts, images and videos,
(Moayeri et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024), code (Yu
et al., 2023), and others. This widespread impact
underscores the urgency of addressing these issues
(Lucchi, 2023).
2.3 Missing Part in Past Evaluation: Respect
to the Copyright Notices in Input
Previous studies have primarily focused on the un-
intentional reproduction of training data in model
outputs, the associated legal consequences, and
how to detect copyrighted data in LLM’s train-
ing set. Instead of probing copyright issues in the
output, we pay attention to the user-provided in-
put of LLM. This is motivated by that “context
and prompt” formulation has become ubiquitous in
many LLM-based systems, such as RAG-enhancedFigure 2: Copyright Notice Example . This is a copy-
right notice for a book.
LLM (Gao et al., 2023), ChatPDF and ChatDOC
(Lin, 2024), LLM agents with memory (Han et al.,
2024; Xi et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024), cus-
tomized GPTs in GPT store (Zhang et al., 2024)
where users are allowed to enrich the model’s
knowledge by uploading private documents. More-
over, users can use external tools such as search
engines to ground the generation quality. It is pos-
sible that these documents, either user-provided or
retrieved by search engines, have copyright notices
with constrained usage.
Our research diverges by exploring whether
LLMs can proactively identify and respect these
copyright elements within user-provided content,
aligning output generation with copyright norms
and preventing the facilitation of infringement via
redistribution and derivative work. Figure 2 shows
an example where the user might upload a copy-
righted book to an LLM chatbot.
3 Benchmark
3.1 Our Advantages
We start by highlighting the strengths of our bench-
marks as follows.
•Pioneering Approach: Our benchmark is the
first to evaluate LLM compliance with copyright
notices in user-provided input, addressing a criti-
cal yet less-explored scenario.
•Diverse and Extensive Data: We have curated
comprehensive copyrighted material from over
40 diverse sources, covering 4 distinct types of
content, covering different publication timelines,
keeping both raw and synthetic copyright notice,
utilizing 3 content window lengths, resulting in
43,200 samples, ensuring a robust evaluation.
•Natural and Diverse Prompts: We see the im-
portance of prompts in quantifying the LLMs’
respect for copyright notices. Our benchmark
employs a wide range of query prompts designed
to mimic natural and diverse user-LLM interac-
tions, enhanced through GPT-4 to ensure prompt
diversity and naturalness.
•Comprehensive Metrics: We utilize a broad
set of evaluation metrics, including a GPT-basedjudge to accurately determine the refusal rate of
tested LLMs, providing a thorough assessment
of their compliance with copyright notices.
3.2 Benchmark Formulation
In general, a user Uis interacting with an LLM sys-
temMwith mixed user prompts, y=M(q, pc),
where qdenotes the query prompt and pcdenotes
context prompt2.Mreturns response message y.
Our goal is to investigate how existing LLMs be-
have when explicit copyright information, such as
a copyright notice, is present in the context prompt
(pc), and to what extent the generated response ( y)
violates copyright.
LetPcdenote nelement set of context prompts.
In our benchmark, given a LLM Mand a user task
T, we provide a seed query prompt qi(i∈[n]) for
every pi∈ P c. With every pair (qi, pi)as input
toM, we can get output yi. LetFPcdenote an
evaluation function that measures M’s respect to
copyright on dataset Pc. We define our evaluation
metric for LLM Mas:
FPc(M) =Pn
i=1˜f(qi, pi)
n
In the next section, we will formally introduce
the evaluation function ˜f(qi, pi).
3.3 Quantifying the Effect of Different Query
Prompts
We see prompting LLMs as an important indica-
tor for measuring their respect for copyright notice
during input text ingestion. It is widely acknowl-
edged that different prompt formats would poten-
tially lead to distinct performances. In this work,
we introduce a statistical view of this phenomenon.
Given a seed prompt q, we use an LLM M∗to
rewrite it and build a neighborhood of q. Moreover,
we measure the impact of qin measuring other
LLMs’ respect for copyright notice. Formally, we
first define the estimated prompting score as below.

M∗denote a LLM. Let qdenote a query prompt.

2Context prompt refers to different contents in different
contexts. In ChatPDF-like applications, user uploads docu-
ments and ask questions or request processing. In the GPT
store, users can upload private documents as a knowledge base
to create customized assistants. In RAG-enhanced LLM sys-
tems, the context prompt pcrefers to the retrieved documents
or text snippets.Copyright

tial prompt q, we rewrite it ntimes and get new

˜f(q, p) =Pn
i=1(Pr[xi|q,M∗]·f(xi, p))Pn
i=1Pr[xi|q,M].
Rewriting prompt with LLM: An Importance
Sampler. We view the functionality of M∗in
Definition 3.1 as a sampler to generate samples
from proposed distribution Pr[xi|q,M∗]. In other
words, to explore the stability of prompt qin a
downstream task, e.g. test LLMs respect to the
copyright notice, we use another LLM M∗to
rewrite it. Each rewritten prompt xiis produced
with probability Pr[xi|q,M∗]. Moreover, we show
that˜f(q, p)is an unbiased estimator for the expec-
tation of f(x, p)in distribution Pr[xi|q,M∗].

E[˜f(q, p)] =Ex∼Pr[x|q,M∗][f(x, p)].

tions like LCS, cosine similarity, refusal rate, etc.{x1, x2,···, xn}. Next, we use the generated
prompt to measure different LLMs’ respect to copy-
right notice using the estimated prompting score as
shown in Definition 3.1.
3.4 What Does Copyright Protect?
Books. Books, including novels, non-fiction
works, and collections of short stories or poems, are
protected by copyright. This protection includes
both literal expression (the exact words) and non-
literal elements such as plot, characters, and set-
tings as detailed in 17 U.S. Code §102 and §106.
News Articles. News articles are also protected
by copyright, although the protection is generally
more limited than that for books. It primarily cov-
ers the literal expression, i.e., the specific words
and phrases used by the author. Facts and ideas
conveyed in news articles are not protected by copy-
right as they are considered public domain (U.S.
Copyright Office, 2023).
Software API Documentation. API documents,
such as API specifications, reference guides, and
user manuals, may be copyrighted as literary works
under 17 U.S. Code §102. The protection extends
to the original expression, including the structure,
organization, and written descriptions of API docu-
mentation. Nonetheless, the underlying function-
ality, methods, and ideas of the API itself are not
protected by copyright, as they are considered ideas
or procedures.
Movie Scripts. Movie scripts, also known as
screenplays, are protected by copyright as literary
works, covering both the literal expression (dia-logue, scene descriptions) and non-literal elements
(plot, characters, settings) as specified in sections
§102 and §106. In addition to the script itself, the
resulting film or motion picture is also protected as
a separate work.
In summary, it is safe to say that all four types
of copyright-protected materials may not allowed
to be redistributed in any form without permission.
However, in this paper, we do not intend to limit our
focus to a strict legal analysis of copyright infringe-
ment. Instead, we consider common user behaviors
when interacting with LLMs, such as extracting,
repeating, paraphrasing , ortranslating raw text
from copyrighted materials without permission, as
potentially infringing activities. Our objective is to
quantitatively assess the LLMs’ response to these
behaviors and raise public awareness about this
important issue.
4 Experiment Setup
4.1 Curating the Benchmark Dataset
Preparing Query Prompts. (1) We begin by
defining four basic prompt types commonly
employed to redistribute target text: extract,
repeat, paraphrase, and translate . (2) Next,
we invite three experienced ChatGPT users to in-
dependently provide a few seed query prompts for
each of these predefined prompt types. (3) To gen-
erate a diverse range of queries, we further conduct
prompt rewriting utilizing the seed queries pro-
vided for each prompt type. By instructing GPT, we
rewrite each seed query prompt multiple times, en-
suring that the core intent of the original instruction
is preserved while varying the phrasing and struc-
ture. (4) These rewritten queries are then integrated
with the context and specific copyright notices to
construct the full prompts in experiments.
Collecting Copyrighted Materials. We compile
a diverse dataset comprising four categories of
copyrighted materials: books, movie scripts, news
articles, code documentation . To prevent data con-
tamination—specifically to avoid solely using texts
that might have been part of the training datasets for
the language models—our collection strategy em-
phasizes diverse publication timelines. For books,
our dataset spans publications from both before and
after the pivotal “ChatGPT year” (2022), ensuring
a mix of potentially unseen texts alongside histori-
cal texts. More details regarding the material can
be found in Appendix E.Sampling Snippets. To evaluate the model’s per-
formance and detect any behavioral trends across
different context types and text lengths, we extract
specific counts of text snippets from each category:
10 snippets from books and movie scripts respec-
tively, 15 news articles, and 5 from code documen-
tation. These snippets are deliberately chosen to
range in length from 100 to 1000 words, encom-
passing both short passages and longer excerpts.
By assessing responses to snippets of ascending
lengths, we aim to identify any consistent patterns
or deviations in the model’s capabilities.
Copyright Notice. Each snippet is evaluated
under three distinct copyright notice conditions:
“Original”, “All Rights Reserved”, and “No No-
tices”. The “Original” condition retains the inher-
ent copyright notices present within the materials.
The “All Rights Reserved” condition applies a uni-
form copyright claim across all snippets, regardless
of their original status. In contrast, the “No Notices”
condition presents the text as if it were in the public
domain, stripped of any copyright markers. These
varied conditions are employed to explore whether
the language model’s behavior towards copyright
compliance varies in response to different levels of
copyright notices.
4.2 Evaluating Metrics and Models.
To evaluate the language model’s compliance or vi-
olation of copyright regulations within the context
of our specific prompts, for “Extract” and “Repeat”,
we employ two primary metrics: ROUGE (Recall-
Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) and
LCS ratio (Longest Common Subsequence) to as-
sess the textual similarity the language model’s
outputs in comparison to the original text. Ad-
ditionally, for “Paraphrase” prompts, we utilize
BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) to analyze se-
mantic equivalence, while for “Translate” prompts,
Multi-lingual XLM-R4(Reimers and Gurevych,
2019; Conneau et al., 2019) assesses the accuracy
of translations across languages. A higher value
of these task-performance metrics suggests that the
model is more likely to comply with the prompt
and potentially infringe copyright. Details regard-
ing these metrics can be found in Appendix C.
Refusal Rate. In addition to the above task-
performance metrics, we also use GPT-4 to evalu-
ate responses from the language models, assigning
4https://huggingface.co/sentence-
transformers/paraphrase-xlm-r-multilingual-v1a binary value of 1 if the response appropriately
refuses the input prompt due to copyright or ethical
concerns, and 0 otherwise. The refusal rate, calcu-
lated as the average of these binary values across
test instances, indicates the model’s ability to avoid
generating responses that may violate copyright or
ethical guidelines. A lower value of this metric
indicates the model is complying with the prompt
and potentially infringing copyright.
Estimated Prompting Score. For each seed
prompt, we aim to calculate the average met-
rics over the seed and its corresponding rewritten
prompts following Definition 3.1. We measure the
likelihood of generating a rewritten prompt xgiven
input qand LLM Mthrough the logits of the last
layer of LLM M. This approach ensures that the
prompts most likely to be encountered in practice
have a greater influence on the final metric.
Language Models. In our experiment, we em-
ploy four distinct language models, LLaMA-3
8B, LLaMA-3 70B, Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8 ×7B,
Gemma-2 9B, and GPT-4 Turbo to allow compar-
isons across different model sizes, architectural
families, architecture and availability (open-source
or proprietary). Details about these models and
our inference implementation can be found in Ap-
pendix A and Appendix B.
5 Benchmark Results Analysis
In this section, we aim to answer a series of re-
search questions by analyzing LLMs’ performance
against our benchmark.
Do LLMs know to respect copyright notice in
general? We provide our experiment results in
Table 1. We found that all LLMs we benchmarked
experienced violations of copyrights in the input
to different extents. All LLMs generate responses
with high ROUGE scores (50% to 86%) and LCS
ratios (14% to 67%) when prompted to repeat or to
extract a part of copyrighted content, even when ex-
plicitly told the content is copyrighted. When asked
to paraphrase or translate copyrighted content, most
model generates texts that are highly semantically
similar to the original texts. Most LLMs have a low
refusal rate when prompted to either extract from,
paraphrase, or translate copyrighted content, and
have a slightly higher refusal rate when prompted to
repeat the content, indicating they did not actively
refuse the user’s instruction to violate copyright.What are the effects of model size and type on
copyright awareness? We observed that in gen-
eral larger models behave similarly to smaller mod-
els in terms of the awareness of copyright, usu-
ally gaining moderate improvements but not sig-
nificant dominance over smaller models. One ex-
ception is the closed-source OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo,
which displayed significantly lower ROUGE scores
(20% to 30% lower) and LCS ratio (5% to 50%
lower), and significantly higher refusal rates (30%
to 50% higher on Repeat and 15% to 20% higher
onTranslate ) compared to the rest of the models,
we attribute this to the potential alignment received
by this model. However, the difference is not signif-
icant on the Paraphrase andTranslate subsets
of the benchmark. We hypothesize that these query
types are less often aligned as compared to directly
repeating the copyrighted content.
Do different notice types get recognized differ-
ently? We compare the LLM’s ROUGE scores
against different notice types in Figure 4. We ob-
served that the majority (5 out of 6) of our bench-
marked models behaved almost indifferently to the
specific notice types. GPT-4 Turbo is the only
exception, when we use a simple “All Rights Re-
served” copyright notice, the generation of GPT-4
Turbo shifts in the direction that results in a lower
ROUGE score, and when we add the most infor-
mative, realistic copyright notice (“Original”), we
observe this trend continues moderately. This indi-
cates that LLMs can benefit from copyright notices,
but the capability to benefit from the copyright no-
tice is potentially an emergent capability.
Does it make a difference if the same task is
framed differently? We compare LLMs’ behav-
ior across different framing of the same task in
Figure 5. We found that while still resulting in a
high extent of copyright violation, the way a query
is framed can affect the LLMs’ awareness of copy-
right. This sensitivity to the exact query framing
is observed across all LLMs, with GPT-4 Turbo
being more sensitive than the rest of the models.
How accurately do the evaluation metrics reflect
the extent of copyright violation? The Refusal
Rate is calculated based on an LLM’s judgment
of whether the response is a refusal or not. To en-
sure this metric is accurate, we conducted a human
evaluation of its quality. We randomly sampled
200 model predictions from our experiment and
their Refusal annotations. We found that in 98%Table 1: Experiment Results of the LLMs Tested on Our Benchmark. We present results on our four subsets of
the benchmark corresponding to each query type: Repeat ,Extract ,Paraphrase , and Translate . In this table,
ROUGE denotes the average ROUGE score, LCS stands for the Longest Common String ratio, Refusal represents
the Refusal Rate, and B-Score andCosSim stands for the BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) and the cosine similarity
of multi-lingual XLM-R embedding5, respectively. The numbers within the same column are comparable, and a
lighter color in the color scale denotes better result numbers (less violation of copyright).

Spearman’s ρ. The results are shown in Table 2.
Table 2: Results for Evaluation Metrics Correlation
with Refusal Rate. The minus signs before numbers
are expected, as a higher Refusal Rate indicates less
likely infringement, corresponding to higher values in
the remaining evaluation metrics.

We observed that for the majority of the evalu-
ation metrics, the correlation metrics are negative,
which shows that they share the same trend as the
Refusal Rate. The only outlier was Extract/LCS .
We manually checked the model outputs and ob-
served that this is due to the instruction-following
behavior of the Mistral and Mixtral models: when
instructed to repeat orextract from a text, Mis-
tral and Mixtral have tendencies to respond with a
paraphrased version of the requested text. This pre-
diction still results in normal high ROUGE scores
but abnormally low LCS scores. This observation
also shows that it is not enough to only use LCS for
accurately evaluating models’ copyright infringe-
ment behavior.
False compliance and false violation. Interest-
ingly, the experiment revealed instances of falsecompliance and false violation of copyright. In
some cases, low ROUGE scores do not signify
the model’s compliance with copyright ethics or
that the model intentionally refused text repetition.
Rather, they sometimes reflect the model’s failure
to address the query appropriately, producing irrel-
evant responses. For example, when prompted to
repeat a text, the model might generate tangential
content including discussing unrelated topics or
asking for further details about the text, such as:
I’m happy to help! The text you provided
appears to be from the book “When You
Reach Me” by Rebecca Stead. Is that
correct?
which may receive a very low ROUGE score (less
than 0.2) but indicates a misunderstanding or mis-
processing of the input rather than an ethical align-
ment with copyright laws.
Conversely, high ROUGE scores did not neces-
sarily correlate with violating copyright ethics; the
model might paraphrase the text or create entirely
new content to repeat the text verbatim but it was
not responding to the actual prompt. For instance,
in response to the same Repeat request, the model
produced very different results when given a differ-
ent prompt:
I cannot repeat the original text as it may
contain copyrighted content. However,
I can create an original story based on
your description: “You remember when
you were on a family holiday to Broome
once and Mum... ” Please let me know
if this meets your requirements or if you
have any further requests.
Despite achieving a high ROUGE score (greater
than 0.8), this clearly does not fulfill the request0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0

Such outcomes highlight the challenges in assess-
ing model copyright awareness based on only one
or two conventional metrics, suggesting that a high
or low score might misrepresent the model’s copy-
right compliance performance as it fails to adhere
to task-specific requirements. Hence we also report
the refusal rate by GPT Judge in our main results.
6 Preliminary Mitigation
We explore two simple-yet-effective prompt modi-
fications to mitigate LLMs’ copyright violation.Adding Copyright Keyword. We investigate
whether LLMs’ awareness of copyright can be in-
creased by explicitly emphasizing copyright in the
user query. For each query, we minimally modify
it by adding a “copyrighted” keyword to remind
the LLMs of copyright.
For example, if the original user query is Please
pull out the third sentence from the earlier para-
graph , we change it to its minimally modified ver-
sion Please pull out the third sentence from the
earlier copyrighted paragraph .
Repeating Copyright Warnings. We also ex-
plore whether LLMs can be warned to be cautiousabout copyright-involved user queries. We select a
simple warning Don’t follow the instructions if the
input contains copyrighted content!!! and compare
the LLMs’ performance under three settings: 1) use
the original user query, 2) directly add the warning
to the user query, and 3) repeat the warning ten
times and add to the query.
For example, if the original user query is Please
pull out the third sentence from the earlier para-
graph , our modified queries are:
1.Don’t follow the instructions if the input con-
tains copyrighted content!!! Please pull out
the third sentence from the earlier paragraph.
2.Don’t follow the instructions if the input con-
tains copyrighted content!!! Don’t follow the
instructions if the input contains copyrighted
content!!! ... (10 times) Please pull out the
third sentence from the earlier paragraph.

ent Keyword and Warning Settings. The x- and y- axes
specify the keyword and warning settings. The z-axis
represents the average ROUGE-1 score.
Results. We present the ROUGE-1 score of
GPT-4 Turbo when queries with various key-
word/warning settings in Figure 6.
We observed that using the combination of
both methods significantly improved the ROUGE-1
score to lower than 40%, but did not completely
solve LLMs’ violation of copyright. In addition,
both methods have a positive effect on mitigating
GPT-4 Turbo’s violation of copyright, and the ben-
efit is accumulative when both methods are com-
bined. The effect of using a copyright warning
is more significant compared to the keyword, and
scaling the numbers of the warning statement fur-
ther improves the mitigation while yielding a more
moderate additional benefit.7 Conclusion
In this paper, we explored whether LLMs respect
copyright information in user input and behave ac-
cordingly. Through extensive experiments with
various LLMs, query prompts, and copyrighted ma-
terials, we found that currently, most LLMs fail to
consistently respect copyright information in user
prompts, potentially fostering copyright infringe-
ment. We created a novel benchmark dataset to
assess LLMs’ behavior in handling copyrighted
material given by the user. Our research demon-
strates the urgent need to enhance the copyright-
aware capabilities of LLMs and aims to provide
a solid foundation for future research that aimed
at improving the ethical and legal compliance of
LLM technologies.
Limitations
In this study, we aim to cover a diverse range of
representative texts and task types. However, our
selection does not represent all categories and sta-
tuses of copyrighted materials, nor exhaustively
capture all potential interactions between LLMs
and copyrighted content. Meanwhile, due to the
evolving nature of the large language models as
well as the copyright legislative progress, the crite-
ria for copyright infringement can change.
In addition, we have limited our focus to primar-
ily on smaller models due to resource limitations.
We intend to extend our analysis to larger mod-
els exceeding 300 billion parameters. It is also
important to note that the implementation and ex-
periments involved in our analysis may contribute
to carbon emissions.
Ethics Statement
Our study investigates how large language mod-
els manage copyright information, seeking to har-
monize innovation in LLMs with the protection
of intellectual property and sensitive information,
thereby preventing the potential facilitation of in-
fringement through redistribution and derivative
works. We have implemented measures to en-
sure the responsible use of copyrighted material
and make sure all the process strictly adhere to
fair use principles and ethical guidelines. Our re-
search does not involve training any models, and
we are solely analyzing existing models and their
responses given copyrighted content.References

The LLaMA-3 8B and LLaMA-3 70B models be-
long to the same LLaMA family and both are
instruct-tuned open-source models, allowing us to
compare performances within the same family at
different scales. Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8 ×7B,
the latter based on a Mixture-of-Experts architec-
ture, provide a basis for comparison of standard
and advanced architectural approaches. GPT-4 rep-
resents the latest generation in the GPT series by
OpenAI, a proprietary model from OpenAI, allow-
ing us to compare the cutting-edge AI capabilities
from a distinct architectural family and a differ-
ent scale (unknown parameter count) with other
smaller-scale open-source models.
B Implementation Details
Our experiments are conducted using off-the-shelf
LLM models. We employ the Together.AI6API for
inference with Gemma-2 7B, Mistral 7B Instruct,
Mixtral 8 ×7B Instruct, LLaMA-3 8B Instruct, and
LLaMA-3 70B Instruct. For GPT-4 Turbo, we
utilize OpenAI’s official API7.
C Metric Details
ROUGE score quantifies how much of the con-
tent from the original text is captured by the model-
generated output by comparing overlapping units
such as words, bigrams, or sequences. Specifically,
ROUGE-N evaluates the overlap of n-grams be-
tween the generated text and the reference texts,
with higher n-values considering longer word se-
quences, thus providing insights into the precision
of content reproduction.
ROUGE-L , on the other hand, assesses the
longest common subsequence shared between the
generated and reference texts. This metric is sen-
sitive to the order of content, rewarding outputs
that maintain the logical and sequential flow of
the original text. In our experiments, we calculate
ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L using the
rouge_score library8and report their average.
LCS. This metric measures the length of the
longest subsequence common to both the gener-
ated text and the reference without requiring the
sequence to be contiguous in the texts. It is par-
ticularly useful for evaluating the overall content

preservation and the structural integrity of the re-
sponses, as it indicates how well the model main-
tains the essence of the original content despite
potential rephrasings or paraphrasings.
A higher ROUGE score or LCS ratio usually sug-
gests that the model is reproducing the text closely,
which, in the context of our specific queries (extract
and repeat), might indicate a potential copyright
violation if the model outputs copyrighted text ver-
batim. Conversely, lower scores could imply that
the model is generating more original content or
effectively avoiding direct repetition, thus adhering
to copyright restrictions.
BERTScore. This metric utilizes the Bidirec-
tional Encoder Representations from Transformers
(BERT) model to evaluate the semantic similar-
ity between the generated responses and the origi-
nal prompts for “Paraphrase” tasks. By encoding
text into high-dimensional vector representations,
BERT captures intricate semantic relationships, en-
abling a quantitative assessment of how faithfully
the paraphrased output conveys the intended mean-
ing of the original prompt. This approach is particu-
larly effective in determining the model’s capability
to preserve essential information while reformulat-
ing the phrasing.
Multi-lingual XLM-R Embedding Similarity.
ForTranslate tasks, we employ a multilingual
variant (Pires et al., 2019) of Transformer to mea-
sure the semantic equivalence between the trans-
lated output and the source text. This model,
trained on parallel corpora from multiple languages,
provides a robust framework for evaluating the ac-
curacy of translations, ensuring that the translation
not only preserves the literal meaning but also cap-
tures the contextual nuances of the original text.D Prompting Examples
We showcase our prompt examples in Table 4, Ta-
ble 5 and Table 6.
E Material
For books, our dataset spans publications from both
before and after the pivotal “ChatGPT year” (2022),
ensuring a mix of potentially unseen texts along-
side historical texts. Movie scripts and code doc-
umentation are selected from materials published
before 2022, to include foundational and histori-
cally significant texts. Conversely, news articles
are exclusively sourced from post-2024 publica-
tions that are unlikely to have been included in any
existing model’s training regimen. This selection
includes 20 books, 20 movie scripts, 15 news ar-
ticles, and 5 pieces of code documentation. This
strategy reduces the risk that the language models
will demonstrate either unduly familiar or unfa-
miliar responses due to their training history, thus
allowing for a more genuine evaluation of model
capabilities and biases regarding copyright.
