Abstract
Existing debiasing techniques are typically
training-based or require access to the model’s
internals and output distributions, so they are
inaccessible to end-users looking to adapt LLM
outputs for their particular needs. In this study,
we examine whether structured prompting tech-
niques can offer opportunities for fair text gen-
eration. We evaluate a comprehensive end-
user-focused iterative framework of debiasing
that applies System 2 thinking processes for
prompts to induce logical, reflective, and criti-
cal text generation, with single, multi-step, in-
struction, and role-based variants. By system-
atically evaluating many LLMs across many
datasets and different prompting strategies, we
show that the more complex System 2-based
Implicative Prompts significantly improve over
other techniques demonstrating lower mean
bias in the outputs with competitive perfor-
mance on the downstream tasks. Our work
offers research directions for the design and the
potential of end-user-focused evaluative frame-
works for LLM use.
1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to per-
petuate the societal biases present in their training
corpora (Vig et al., 2020; Gallegos et al., 2023;
Li et al., 2023a). These biases occur due to un-
vetted data sources or unbalanced representations
of social groups within this data and can have
far-reaching consequences by affecting decision-
making processes, perpetuating stereotypes, and
exacerbating existing inequalities (Sun et al., 2024;
Thakur, 2023). To this end, numerous techniques
have been developed for bias mitigation in LLMs
such as re-training model representations (Liang
et al., 2021; Webster et al., 2020), fine-tuning mod-
els with augmented data (Zmigrod et al., 2019), or
adjusting the model’s output logits and their decod-
ing strategies (Schick et al., 2021; Banerjee et al.,
*These authors contributed equally2023). However, due to security, privacy and com-
mercial reasons, many state-of-the-art LLMs are
closed API-only models that do not provide access
to the model’s internals, training data or the flexibil-
ity to modify the LLMs’ decoding strategies. This
implies that users cannot employ any of the afore-
mentioned debiasing techniques for such LLMs
and are dependent on the model providers. Further,
we believe that there can be instances where users
possess the models or prefer using the open-source
LLMs. However, even then curating fair data (Zmi-
grod et al., 2019) that is sufficient in scale and qual-
ity to re-train the LLMs is prohibitively expensive
and out of reach for many. Moreover, given that
modern day LLMs are very carefully tuned during
the pre-training to demonstrate efficacy across mul-
titude of tasks, any modification to their weights or
decoding strategies may lead to intractable adverse
effects on other downstream tasks except fairness.
To this, we ask the following question - “How can
we address the problem of biases in LLMs without
having access to the model or its output probabili-
ties?" Hence, we focus on the end users’ freedom
toprompt the LLMs and debias according to their
requirements.
Contributions. We develop and evaluate an end-
user-focused iterative framework for debiasing
language models. Inspired by human decision-
making (Kahneman, 2011), we have organized the
existing prompting methods – and introduced new
ones – along three broad categories (Prefix Prompt-
ing, Self-Refinement, and Implication Prompting)
and following two dimensions – (single v/s k-step
prompting, and instruction v/s role-prompting). We
report an evaluation of many state-of-the-art LLMs
with various prompting techniques exemplifying
these categories and complexities and evaluate the
outputs on several benchmarks. Our frameworks
demonstrate debiasing performance equal to exist-
ing white-box methods without any decrease in per-
formance on downstream tasks. To the best of ourarXiv:2405.10431v1  [cs.CL]  16 May 2024knowledge, this paper represents the first in-depth
exploration of this direction, and we anticipate that
our framework paves the way for future research in
prompt-based debiasing of LLMs.
2 Related Work
Due to the vast nature of LLM training cor-
pora (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021; Team, 2023;
Jiang et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023), it is in-
feasible to vet them for potentially biased or harm-
ful text data. Given the resource-intensive nature
of retraining approaches, recent work focuses on
post-hoc debiasing techniques. Liang et al. (2020)
introduced Sent-Debias, demonstrating the capabil-
ity to debias sentences by eliminating the projec-
tion of bias subspace from sentence representations.
Additionally, SelfDebias (Schick et al., 2021) and
CAFIE (Banerjee et al., 2023) utilize output proba-
bilities to generate fairer outcomes through biased
prompts and counterfactuals, respectively. Unlike
the proposed prompting frameworks, these meth-
ods require retraining, access to model parameters,
and modification of decoding strategies.

Prompting and Bias Mitigation. The most com-
mon way to prompt a model is to simply provide itwith an instruction and allow it to complete the text.
Another popular way to prompt LLMs is by using
roles and personas (Kong et al., 2023) to emulate
human-like interactions for better zero-shot perfor-
mance. Alternatively, Few-Shot prompting (Brown
et al., 2020b) allows the models to adapt to tasks by
inferring from examples provided directly within
the input, improving flexibility. However, these
approaches are not well suited for reasoning tasks.
This led to works that provide LLMs with natu-
ral language ‘chains-of-thought’ (Wei et al., 2022;
Kojima et al., 2022), which provides intermediate
reasoning steps to the LLMs and improves their
performance across arithmetic and reasoning ques-
tions. Drawing parallels to how humans improve
their outputs through reflection, (Madaan et al.,
2023) use LLMs to generate outputs, provide feed-
back and then self-refine. Although well-studied
otherwise, we argue that limited research has been
dedicated to examining fairness through the afore-
mentioned prompting techniques.
Ma et al. (2023) propose a prompt-search frame-
work for predictive fairness requiring significant
computational resources to find the best prompt
making it impractical in a generic setting. In con-
trast, Borchers et al. (2022) explore keyword-based
prompt engineering to address gender bias in job
advertisements. Yet, this body of work is discon-
nected from the work applying reasoning-based
prompts for better output generation.
In summary, we note that while intricate prompt-
ing strategies are being developed for a wide range
of tasks, they are not specifically studied for fair
text generation. While some studies exist (Borchers
et al., 2022; Si et al., 2023), they are restricted to ba-
sic prompting approaches such as keyword-based
or simple prefixes. Thus, no prior work formally
studies the detailed adaptation of existing state-of-
the-art prompting frameworks for fairness or the op-
timal ways to prompt LLMs for bias removal. Most
findings suggest no significant improvement in
bias reduction through prompting (Borchers et al.,
2022), yet Brown et al. (2020a) demonstrate that
refined natural language instructions can, in fact,
effectively steer GPT-3 in mitigating gender bias.
While encouraging, this approach lacks a compre-
hensive analysis of different prompting strategies
(e.g., iterative, multi-prompt, feedback-based re-
finement), their impact on different biases (e.g., re-
ligion, race, sexual orientation), and their variance
across different recent LLMs (e.g., MPT, Llama-
2, Mistral). Hence, this gap motivates our currentwork that comprehensively studies these dimen-
sions and proposes effective prompting techniques
for bias removal.
3 Prompting Framework
In this section, we describe the prompting strategies
we use to mitigate biases or stereotypes in language
model outputs. Our approach is inspired by the
heuristics of decision-making discussed by Kahne-
man (2011). Many decisions are made intuitively
and exemplify System 1 decision-making as they
are automatic, unconscious, and direct responses
to stimuli. However, like humans, if and when
prompted, LLMs can learn to second-guess their in-
stincts through slow, effortful, and logical thinking,
known as System 2 decision-making, and exem-
plified most simply through Prefix Prompting, our
first category of prompts where we simply remind
LLMs to be fair. If this does not work, we can
show the person their biased outputs (the known
risks), invoking their implicit understanding and
pushing them to be fair. This forms our second
category, which we term Self-Refinement, which
approximates the concept of decision-making un-
der risk in System 2 decision-making (Kahneman
and Tversky, 2013). Finally, humans can also be
compelled to correct their reasoning by providing
explicit reasoning or feedback on why their outputs
are biased, denoted as critical reflection in System
2 decision-making (Kahneman, 2011).
Accordingly, in our work, we chose three broad
categories of approaches based on the specificity
of the feedback provided to the LLM. The simplest
prompts involve direct requests, which exemplify
our first category, Prefix Prompting , in which we
simply direct the model to not be biased. Our next
category invokes Self-Refinement wherein LLMs
refer to their self-generated biased texts. We invoke
a multi-step process that provides the LLM with its
self-generated biased outputs and urges it to be fair
during the subsequent generations. Finally, Impli-
cation Prompting encourages the LLM towards
fair generation by providing them with reasoning.
Once again, we invoke a multi-step process to en-
courage the LLM towards fair generation by pro-
viding a reasoning of why an output is biased. The
approaches are exemplified in Table 1 which uses
examples from the Regard dataset to demonstrate
the difference in the outputs vs. the base (row 1)
when an instruction vs. a role prompt is provided
(rows 2 vs. 3), and in a single vs. a multi-stepprompting process is followed (row 3 vs. row 4).
Finally, row 5 suggests how implication prompting
compares to the other methods.
Notations. LetMbe a pre-trained language model
with token vocabulary V. Given a prompt Crepre-
sented as a sequence of tokens ( x1. . . x N),Mgen-
erates a probability distribution Po:V→[0,1].
Subsequently, employing a decoding strategy, Po
is used to stochastically sample the next tokens
(xN+1,xN+1. . . ) and generate the output text S.
Thus, we have M(C, V) =S.
3.1 Prefix Prompting (PP)
In this approach, we prepend a prefix to the in-
put user prompt, and instruct the model to pro-
duce unbiased outputs. More specifically, given C
be an input user prompt that introduces biases in
the language model output, we prepend it with a
debiasing prefix Idebias to obtain the final prompt
Cdebias =concat (Idebias, C). Following (Borchers
et al., 2022) and (Kong et al., 2023), our exper-
iments employ two types of prefixes, described
next.
Instruction PP Prompt:
The following text is unbiased and does not discriminate
against people on the basis of their gender, race, religion,
or any other sensitive attribute: [ USER PROMPT ]
Role PP Prompt:
You are an unbiased person who does not discriminate
against people based on their gender, race, religion, or
any other sensitive attribute. [ USER PROMPT ]
3.2 Self Refinement (SR)
We observed that the outputs generated with a sim-
ple single-step prefix prompting still possessed a
substantial bias. Thus, we extend it to a k-step
approach where our objective is to obtain more re-
fined outputs by asking the model to refer to its
previous step outputs for carrying out subsequent
generations.
Next, we describe this strategy for k=1, and pro-
vide its generic formulation in Algorithm 1.
Step I – Given the input user prompt C, we first
perform the Prefix Prompting strategy to obtain out-
putS0, which is the reference text for the LLM’s
subsequent generation.
Step II – We then combine S0with another debi-
asing prefix ISRto obtain the final prompt CSR=
concat (S0, ISR). With this prompt, we query the
language model and generate an output S1. Simi-
lar to Sec 3.1, we employ two variants of ISR, asdescribed next.
Instruction SR Prompt:
Here is a text you generated: [ OUTPUT ]
Now refer to this text and generate some text that is
unbiased and does not discriminate against people on the
basis of their gender, race, religion, or any other sensitive
attribute. [ USER PROMPT ]
Role SR Prompt:
Here is a text you generated: [ OUTPUT ]
Now refer to this text considering that
you are an unbiased person who does not discrimi-
nate against people on the basis of their gender, race,
religion, or any other sensitive attribute. [ USER PROMPT ]

3.3 Implication Prompting (IP)
Self-Refinement (SR) can be challenging for the
LLM since it entails simply referring to its own
biased outputs for generating fair text. Thus, we
hypothesize that a better way would be to provide
the LLM with a reasoning or implication alongside
its generated text explaining why it is biased. Given
that we cannot hard-code implications correspond-
ing to every possible model output, we propose
to generate such implications on the fly using the
same LLM itself. More concretely, we divide this
framework into three steps (see Algorithm 2), de-
scribed next.
Step I – The first input to the LLM is simply the
user prompt Cthat generates an output Swhich
might be biased.
Step II – The next input to the LLM is CImpl, a
prompt made using the initial output Sconcate-
nated with an instruction IImpl. This instruction
asks the model to generate the Implication SImplof
the output S. The goal of this step is to make the
model identify any biases or stereotypes present in
the initial output. Following (Borchers et al., 2022;
Kong et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020b), we employ
three popular reasoning instructions IImplfor our
experiments.Instruction-Based CImpl :
Here is a text: [ OUTPUT ]
Generate the implication of the given text:
Zero-Shot CoT-Based CImpl :
Here is a text: [ OUTPUT ]
Thinking step by step, generate the implication of the
given text:
Fewshot-Based CImpl :
For each text, generate the implication which shows the
stereotype present in the text.
[Text 1]: We shouldn’t lower our standards just to hire
more women.
[Implication 1]: This text implies that woman are less
qualified than men.
.
.
[Text 4]: [ OUTPUT ]
[Implication 4]:
Step III – The final prompt CIPcombines the
model’s initial biased output S, the generated im-
plication SImpl, and an instruction IIP. We now
query the language model with CIPto obtain the
final debiased output.
Final Prompt CIP:
You are an unbiased person who does not discriminate
against people on the basis of their gender, race, religion,
or any other sensitive attribute.
Here is a sentence you generated: [ OUTPUT ]
Here is the implication that indicates the bias present in
the text: [ IMPLICATION ]
Now, considering the implication and referring to the
original sentence, generate an unbiased text that does
not discriminate against people on the basis of their gen-
der, race, religion, or any other sensitive attribute: [ USER
PROMPT ]

4 Models and Metrics
In this section, we discuss the language models and
the metrics used in our experiments. More specifi-
cally, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs over
four standard metrics serving as vital indicators of
the model’s adherence to fairness, and inclusivity.Method SS LM ICAT Method SS LM ICAT

Models. Our study includes four LLMs hav-
ing diverse architectures and training methodolo-
gies: GPT-J (6B) (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021),
Mistral-v0.1 (7B) (Jiang et al., 2023), Llama-2
(7B) (Touvron et al., 2023), and MPT-Instruct (7B)
(Team, 2023). We download the weights and imple-
mentations of these models from the Huggingface
library and perform our experiments on one 32GB
NVIDIA V100 GPU.
StereoSet. (Nadeem et al., 2020). This dataset
measures bias across gender, race, religion, and
profession attributes. Each sentence in this dataset
features a template with a blank, which can be filled
with a stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or unrelated
word. For example, the template could be ‘The
boy is [BLANK] at school.’ For this sentence, the
stereotypical word is ‘rowdy’, the anti-stereotypical
word is ‘calm’, and the unrelated word is ‘mirror’.
For our experiments, we use a subset of the dataset
(∼53%) consisting of sentence clusters where the
[BLANK] word is at the end of the template. This
is because some of our approaches require an inter-
mediate output that cannot be reasonably produced
for sentences with the blank in the middle due to
causal language modeling. We have confirmed
that using this subset does not impact performance
since the base model’s results on this subset are
very similar to the results on the entire dataset. Weevaluate model performance using three metrics:
Stereotype Score (SS), Language Modeling score
(LM), and Idealized Context Association Test score
(ICAT). The SS score reflects the fraction of times
the stereotypical sentence has a higher probability
than the anti-stereotypical sentence, with an ideal
score of 50%. The LM score measures the propor-
tion of times the unrelated sentence has the lowest
probability of generation, having an ideal score of
100%. ICAT score combines SS and LM scores,
representing the tradeoff between bias reduction
and language modeling ability, with an ideal score
of 100%.
Regard. (Sheng et al., 2019). Sentiment classifiers
have long been used as bias estimators; however,
(Sheng et al., 2019) argues that sentiments are not
often correlated to the human judgment of bias. For
instance, in the sentence ‘XYZ worked as a pimp
for 15 years’, even though the sentiment is neu-
tral, the presence of the word ’pimp’ still surfaces
a negative connotation towards the demographic
XYZ. Addressing this discrepancy, the concept of
’regard’ estimates the bias by leveraging the social
perception of a demographic, which is measured
by considering characteristics like occupations and
respect towards a demographic.
More specifically, (Sheng et al., 2019) captures
biases across three attributes using pairs of de-Method Gender Race Orientation Mean Method Gender Race Orientation Mean

mographics: Gender ( female and male ), Race
(Black andWhite ), and Sexual Orientation ( Gay
and Straight ). They begin by constructing 10
prompt templates per demographic (say "Male")
and generate 10 sentences per template. Then, by
using a classifier1, they compute regard per output
of a demographic to obtain an overall regard score
for a demographic:
SMale= (Npos−Nneg)/Ntotal (1)
where Ntotalis the total number of outputs, and
Npos,Nnegare the number of outputs with posi-
tive and negative regard respectively. Finally, for
each attribute (say "gender"), the final regard score
is computed as the difference of regard scores be-
tween the demographics:
RGender =SFemale−SMale (2)
The ideal regard score is 0, while a negative
number indicates stereotypical bias and a positive
number represents anti-stereotypical bias. Toxic-
ity(Gehman et al., 2020). In this metric, we assess
the model’s performance beyond bias and evaluate
its toxicity mitigation capabilities using the Re-
alToxicityPrompts dataset. By employing a fine-
tuned hate speech detection model2, we compute
the probability of model completions being toxic
across 1000 randomly sampled prompts. For each

5 Results and Discussion
In this section, we refer to our quantitative evalua-
tions (Tables 2, 3, 4) to discuss the insights obtained
from each of them.
Role-based Prefix Prompting debiases better
than Instruction-based. Notably, the persona/role
prefix outperforms the standard instruction prefix
on all three metrics. On StereoSet (Table 2), Role
prefix has, on average across all models, a 2.14%
lower SS score and a 5.08% higher ICAT score. In
the case of Regard (see Table 3), the Role prefix’s
average performance exceeds that of the instruction
prefix by nearly 39.47% across all models. Further-
more, Table 4 reveals that outputs generated using
the Role prefix are 4.34% less toxic than those pro-
duced with the instruction prefix. We substantiate
more about these findings in Section 6.
Combining prefixes with the previously gener-
ated output of LLMs improves debiasing. For
2/3 benchmarks, we find that Self-Refinement is
significantly better than Prefix Prompting. Specif-
ically, Self-Refinement with k=1 has, on average,
an SS score 6.85% lower than the prefix prompt-
ing approach, and a 11.65% higher ICAT score.
This performance improvement is nearly 21.64%
on the regard metric. On toxicity, however, SR
with k=1 shows a slight increase in average toxi-Method Mean Change Method Mean Change

city compared to prefix prompting (1.11%). Fur-
ther, we found that even though single iteration
Self-Refinement frameworks show a significant im-
provement in performance over prefix prompting,
performing two or more iterations of this frame-
work often does not yield a competitive or any
increase. SR with k=2 provides a mere 0.23% av-
erage improvement in SS score over SR with k=1.
Similarly, the ICAT score improves by only 0.42%
and we notice no improvement in the Regard met-
ric. We report this behavior for more values of k >
2 in Section 6.
Implication Prompting achieves the overall fair
outputs. For all the benchmarks, we consistently
find that Implication Prompting outperforms the
other two frameworks. By averaging across IP vari-
ants and models, we find that it has a 4.05% lower
SS score and a 6.80% higher ICAT score on Stere-
oSet compared to all other methods. Similarly, it
shows an average improvement of 26.85% on Re-
gard and a 6.98% decrease in average toxicity of
outputs. Thus, we conclude that providing reason-
ing about why an output is biased indeed has a
positive impact on fair text generation.
Tradeoff between Bias and Language Model-
ing Ability. Prior research has noted a decrease
in language modeling ability that accompanies a
reduction in output bias. However, there is no con-
sistent trend demonstrating this in our experiments.
While GPTJ and MPT Instruct show a decrease
in the LM Score on StereoSet as the SS Score im-proves, Mistral and Llama-2 exhibit the LM score
of multi-step approaches to outperform the base
model. By averaging across the models, we ob-
serve that prefix prompting approaches possess a
0.61% increase in LM score over the base model,
self-refinement methods show a 0.46% drop in LM
score, and implication prompting reports a 0.09%
decrease over the base model. In Appendix B, we
perform evaluation on more downstream tasks such
as TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022), BoolQ (Clark
et al., 2019) and note competitive performances of
prompting frameworks compared to the baselines.
6 Ablations and Analysis
In this section, we vary components of the afore-
mentioned prompting strategies to consolidate our
investigation. For each study, we ablate on each
of our metrics and report the average across all the
LLMs evaluated in this paper, if not specified.
Choice of Role and Instruction prefixes. In ad-
dition to the role and instruction prefixes given
in Section 3.1, we now experiment with four dif-
ferent choices of each prefix to further establish
our findings. We create these prefix variations by
rephrasing the existing ones or using synonymous
words. More details on these prefixes are included
in the Appendix. From Table 5, we observe that
the role prefixes consistently perform better than
the instruction ones, having a 1.7% higher ICAT
score, and a 4.5% lower toxicity score.

Average 65.18 0.11 0.043
Table 5: Varying the choices of instruction and role
prefixes on StereoSet, Regard, and Toxicity. Scores are
averaged across all 4 LLMs.
Section 5, we note that the performance of self-
refinement with k=2 is only marginally different
from that of k=1. To understand this further, we
experiment with variations in the number of iter-
ations (k) of refinement and report our results in
Figures 1a, 1b, 1c. We see a similar trend for k=3,4
and note that each of their performances lie within
comparable ranges of k=1. Thus, we conclude that
SR with k=1 is sufficient to reap benefits over PP.
Varying the models for Implication generation.
In Section 3.3, we discuss the use of the same
model architecture to generate the underlying im-
plication of a model’s output. However, we now
ablate this choice by selecting models that are ac-
cordingly smaller and larger than the input model.
Specifically for this experiment, we choose GPTJ
(6B), MPT (7B), and Mistral (7B) as the input mod-
els and debias them by generating implicationsfrom TinyLLama (1.1B) (Zhang et al., 2024) and
Llama-2 (13B). The results in Figures 1d, 1e, 1f are
averaged across the three models and demonstrate
that despite slight variations, the performances of
implications generated by both TinyLlama and
Llama-2 lie in close range of the implications gen-
erated by Mistral itself. This observation further
establishes the efficacy of reasoning-based meth-
ods, while highlighting that low-latency models
can be used for implication generation.
7 Conclusion
This study addresses the challenge of mitigating
biases of LLMs under common settings that limit
direct access to their internal mechanics. Leverag-
ing the principles of System 2 thinking, we eval-
uate three prompt-based strategies designed for
equitable text generation: Prefix Prompting, Self-
Refinement, and Implication Prompting. Our evalu-
ation, spanning a variety of metrics and models, re-
veals the distinct advantages of these methods. No-
tably, Implication Prompting emerges as the most
effective technique, as it directly communicates the
rationale for avoiding biases to the LLM, followed
by Self-Refinement and Prefix Prompting in terms
of efficacy. This hierarchy highlights how sophis-
ticated prompts, particularly those that engage the
model in deeper reasoning, can provide a strate-
gic edge in mitigating biases more effectively than
simpler approaches. Our findings pave the way for
future explorations into prompt-based debiasing of
LLMs, offering a foundational step towards more
nuanced and effective bias mitigation strategies.8 Limitations and Future Work
Our work was hindered by the constraints on our
computational resources, as we were unable to ex-
periment with larger models such as 70B variants
of Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023) and Mixture
of Experts models such as Mixtral (45B) (Jiang
et al., 2024). Further, due to space and time con-
straints, many other advanced prompting methods
such as Tree-of-Thought (Yao et al., 2023), Self-
Consistency (Wang et al., 2023), and Directional
Stimulus Prompting (Li et al., 2023b) were not
explored. Yet, our framework is generalizable
in that it offers insights into their expected rela-
tive performance based on whether or not they are
prompted with prefixing, self-refinement, implica-
tive prompts, and repeated refinements.
Our work suffers from limitations common to other
debiasing studies, including the potential oversim-
plification of complex social biases into prompts
that may not capture the full scope of biases in
language models. Additionally, the reliance on
prompt-based techniques assumes model responses
to prompts are consistent, which may not hold
across different LLMs or when models are updated.
We have tried to control for these errors by repeat-
edly prompting models when such errors could
have occurred and reporting means instead of ab-
solute errors. We have also reported p-corrected
t-tests to demonstrate that our results are not an arti-
fact of the sample selected. Nevertheless, in future
work, we plan to design more sophisticated debias-
ing problems that can challenge and improve the
generalizability of end-user-focused frameworks
such as ours.

A Additional Details and Results
Due to space constraints in the main paper, this
section includes further explanation of our experi-
mental settings.
Prefixes used in Section 6 (role and instruction
prefix ablation). Table 6 includes the four prompt
variations for both role-based and instruction-based
prompting, as used in this ablation.
More qualitative results. Here, we include the
examples for Implication generations (see Table
9), and Self-Refinement Outputs k=2 v/s k=1 (see
Table 10).
Detailed Stereoset table. In the main paper, we
include the overall stereoset scores (SS), whichdoes not highlight the attribute-wise performance
of approaches. Therefore, we present the complete
table (see Table 7) containing the SS scores of each
prompting strategy for attributes such as Gender,
Profession, Race, and Religion. To summarize
these results, we note that findings for the Overall
SS score are consistent with those of attribute-wise
scores.
Generation hyperparameters. For all our experi-
ments, we set temperature= 1.0, while for StereoSet
we also employ a repetition penalty= 1.3. If not
specified, our default decoding strategy is beam
search.
B Comparing prompting methods with
the other debiasing methods
In the main paper, we discuss how the infeasibil-
ity of accessing the language model’s logits or
probabilities makes it essential to adopt prompt-
based debiasing strategies. However, for a better
understanding and completeness, we now evaluate
against the existing debiasing methods in the litera-
ture. More specifically, we choose 1) SDB (Schick
et al., 2021), CAFIE (Banerjee et al., 2023) – post-
hoc debiasing based methods that recalibrate the
output logits for a fairer decoding, 2) SentenceDe-
Instruction-1 The following text is unbiased and does not
discriminate against people on the basis of
their gender, race, religion, or any other
sensitive attribute:
Instruction-2 Avoid perpetuating stereotypes when
discussing individuals or communities.
Instruction-3 Generate text using inclusive language that
does not marginalize any group.
Instruction-4 Consciously steer clear of language that may
reinforce gender, race, or religious
stereotypes.
Role-1 You are an unbiased person who does not
discriminate against people on the basis of
their gender, race, religion, or any other
sensitive attribute
Role-2 You are a fair-minded person who promotes
inclusivity and is not prejudiced against
groups of people on the basis of their gender,
race, religion, or any other sensitive attribute.
Role-3 You are a socially conscious observer who
promotes inclusivity and does not perpetuate
stereotypes.
Role-4 Adopt a perspective that addresses and
corrects for social biases while generating
the following text.

Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) based
training methods (Xie and Lukasiewicz, 2023) in-
cluding fine-tuning, adapter-tuning, prefix-tuning,
and prompt tuning. Due to compute constraints,
we ran these evaluations on GPT2-small (125M),
although, we did try to extend them to GPTJ (6B)
and were unable to run the compute-heavy training
based CDA methods. Our results in Table 7 demon-
strate that for GPT2-small, the prompting-based
approaches are either consistently outperforming
or at-par with the other debiasing methods. For
GPTJ, we note that even though the Prefix Prompt-
ing methods achieve lower performances, the Self-
Refinement based and the Implication based meth-
ods are still on-par. To summarize, we note that
even though current prompting frameworks do not
utilize the additional information like the other de-
biasing approaches, their numbers are competitive
to establish their potential of debiasing. In addition,
the simplicity to implement them in any pipeline
without modifying the model’s internals further
reaffirms our belief that our evaluations will en-
courage more works towards prompting-based de-
biasing.
C Utilizing a Fixed Generic Implication
In Section 3, we propose to generate implications
on the fly using the LLM itself. Now, we inves-
tigate this choice and employ a fixed implication
across all the user prompts and models. Since this
strategy does not ask the model to generate the
reasoning, we divide it into two steps:
Step I – The first input to the LLM is simply the
user prompt Cthat generates an output Swhich
might be biased.
Step II – We then combine Swith the fixed impli-
cation instruction Ifixto obtain the prompt CIP,
which is used to finally query the LLM.
Final Prompt CIP:

gion, or other sensitive attributes. Generate an

methodologies mentioned in Section 3.3 and re-
port the results in Table 8. We consistently observe
that equipping LLMs with reasoning tailored to
specific user prompts outperforms generic reason-
ing. Thus, adding more color to the notion that
providing effective reasoning is indeed helpful for
LLMs to correct their bias.
D Measuring Language Model’s
Performance on downstream Question
answering tasks
In Table 2, we include the LM scores and report that
language modelling ability of the prompt based de-
biasing methods is on-par with the baselines. Here,
we further study the effect of these techniques on
the performance of LLM for other downstream
tasks such, TruthfulQA and BoolQ. By summariz-
ing our results across all models in Table 12, we ob-
serve that while Prefix Prompting incur an average
15% performance decrease on TruthfulQA and no
change on BoolQ, the Self-Refinement based and
Implication based approaches achieve at-par num-
bers with the baseline. Even further, we observe
that Implication based methods achieve the best pe-
formance on the TruthfulQA ( 9% increase over the
base model) and the Self-Refinement based meth-
ods achieve the best performance on BoolQ ( 1%
increase over the base model). Thus, we concludePrompt The black person was regarded as
Base a thing, an object, or a commodity.
