Abstract
Warning: Contents of this paper may be up-
setting. Public attitudes towards key societal
issues, expressed on online media, are of im-
mense value in policy and reform efforts, yet
challenging to understand at scale . We study
one such social issue: homelessness in the U.S.,
by leveraging the remarkable capabilities of
large language models to assist social work
experts in analyzing millions of posts from
Twitter. We introduce a framing typology: On-
line Attitudes Towards Homelessness ( OATH )
Frames: nine hierarchical frames capturing cri-
tiques, responses and perceptions. We release
annotations with varying degrees of assistance
from language models, with immense benefits
in scaling: 6.5 √óspeedup in annotation time
while only incurring a 3 point F 1reduction
in performance with respect to the domain ex-
perts. Our experiments demonstrate the value
of modeling OATH-Frames over existing senti-
ment and toxicity classifiers. Our large-scale
analysis with predicted OATH-Frames on 2.4M
posts on homelessness reveal key trends in atti-
tudes across states, time periods and vulnerable
populations, enabling new insights on the issue.
Our work provides a general framework to un-
derstand nuanced public attitudes at scale, on
issues beyond homelessness.
1 Introduction
Public opinion towards social issues is used as a
signal by advocacy organizations to garner support
for their relief and reform efforts (Burstein, 2020).
Online social media platforms, such as Twitter1,
serve as a great repository of public opinion from
a diverse (e.g., socio-economic and political) user
base (Hu et al., 2021). However, understanding
broader public opinion necessitates processing on-
line discourse at a large scale , a daunting challenge
in social science research. Large language models
(LLMs) have recently been used in social science
1Now, X: https://x.com .(Ziems et al., 2023; Cho et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023;
Bohra et al., 2023), and may offer a promising so-
lution to the scale challenge. However, can LLMs
be reliably used to process discourse with nuanced
latent attitudes towards complex societal issues?
One such issue is homelessness in the U.S.2,
which inspires complex and nuanced public atti-
tudes and beliefs (Robertson and Greenblatt, 1992).
For instance, it is common for people to simulta-
neously feel both sympathy towards the plight of
people experiencing homelessness (PEH), as well
as anger and resentment towards them (Cronley,
2010; Moore et al., 1988; Narayan and Petesch,
2002). A majority of work from social science has
studied discourse about homelessness via ethno-
graphic studies, qualitative surveys, and smaller
scale content analyses (Kim et al., 2023; Tsai et al.,
2019; Kingree and Daves, 1997). However, under-
standing the societal attitudes about homelessness
at a large scale via online discourse has rarely been
attempted in prior efforts. Our work investigates
the role of LLMs in reliably assisting social work
experts in characterizing such large-scale online
discourse on homelessness.
In this work, we introduce a novel framework to
understand, synthesize and characterize large-scale
public attitudes towards societal issues through
a collaboration between social work experts and
LLMs, illustrated in Figure 1. Our framework con-
sists of three components designed to study written
discourse on social issues: (i) the discovery of a
framing typology (¬ß2), (ii) annotation of data at
scale with this typology (¬ß3), and (iii) the analysis
of these collected annotations (¬ß4). While we fo-
cus our study on homelessness, our framework is
generalizable to other domains of social discourse.
At the heart of our framework is our novel fram-
ing typology to characterize Online Attitudes To-

in 2023 (Sousa et al., 2023).

Figure 1: Overview of OATH-Frames Collection. (1.) Domain experts applied grounded theory to surface
nine Issue-specific frames, their corresponding definitions ( OATH-Definitions ), and annotation guidelines
(OATH-Guidelines ). (2.) We annotated posts with OATH-Frames via Experts, via Experts + LLM ( GPT-4 ), and via
Multlilabel Classifier ( Flan-T5-Large ). Our Experts + LLM annotations pipeline consists of (2.1) prompt editing

wards Homelessness ( OATH-Frames ) in the U.S., as
expressed in social media posts from Twitter (¬ß2).
Our frames are developed using framing theory
(Entman, 1993) and grounded theory (Glaser and
Strauss, 1967) from social science, and in collabo-
ration with social work researchers studying home-
lessness. OATH-Frames can be broadly categorized
into three themes: Critiques ,Perceptions
and Responses to PEH, and further into nine
finer-grained Issue-specific frames; Table 1 il-
lustrates our typology with examples. We pro-
vide three kinds of OATH-Frames annotations for
posts from Twitter: 4.1K expert-only (¬ß3.1), 4.1K
LLM-assisted expert (¬ß3.2) and 2.4M predicted an-
notations from a multi-label classification model
(¬ß3.3). Our LLM-assisted expert annotation for
socially sensitive tasks follows a new scalable
framework which incorporates expert insights
(OATH-Guidelines ) and chain-of-thought (CoT)
explanations for designing better LLM prompts.
This results in a 6.5 √óannotation speedup, while
incurring only a 3 point F 1reduction in accuracy
compared to experts‚Äîan attractive trade-off for
our multi-label annotation task.
We observe that the most salient theme in expert-only annotations is Perceptions of PEH while
the rest of our annotations highlight Critiques
of the government, normative structures and (lack
of) aid distribution (Figure 2).
Our 2.4M OATH-Frames -annotated posts enable
a large-scale analysis across states and time peri-
ods, revealing changing trends in attitudes with key
sociopolitical events (¬ß4). OATH-Frames surface
harmful language towards PEH, which we show
are often mislabeled by popular sentiment and tox-
icity classifiers, highlighting the value of our ty-
pology. We empirically establish trends where
differences in attitudes are observed, when vul-
nerable populations are compared with PEH; for
instance, comparisons with immigrants elicit harm-
ful rhetoric whereas those with Ukrainians elicit
critiques towards the government for funding allo-
cation. OATH-Frames can assist in understanding
nuanced issues concerning marginalized PEH pop-
ulations, often ignored in language technologies
(Kiritchenko et al., 2023). Overall, our framework
provides a blueprint for fast and scalable analysis
of public opinion on key social issues of our time;
we believe this will aid advocacy groups and politi-
cal constituents in work towards meaningful social

2OATH-Frames Discovery
We discovered a novel typology of pragmatic
frames for capturing and characterizing societal
attitudes towards homelessness and people expe-
riencing homelessness (PEH). To this end, we
applied concepts from framing theory (Entman,
1993), which has been used to identify how cer-
tain aspects in an issue‚Äôs portrayal are emphasized
to influence broader public opinion for topics like
immigration (Mendelsohn et al., 2021), politics in
media (Boydstun and Gross, 2013), eating disor-
ders (Arseniev-Koehler et al., 2016), and so on. In
social media discourse, prior work has focused on
the framing of stigma towards PEH (Kim et al.,
2023) and surveys that study attitudes and percep-
tions towards PEH (Toro and McDonnell, 1992;
Agans and Liu, 2015). In our work, we drew in-
3https://dill-lab.github.io/oath-frames/spiration from Kim et al. (2023) and their applica-
tion of grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967)
to characterize societal attitudes on homelessness
at scale , going beyond stigma. Following Boyd-
stun and Gross (2013), our Frame Discovery pro-
cess uncovered salient themes (frame types) in a
text corpus on a topic; in the context of our study,
this resulted in OATH-Frames (Frames for Online
Attitudes Towards Homelessness).
Using a keyword search for ‚Äú homeless ‚Äù on the
Twitter API,4we sample 5M posts. We prepro-
cessed this sample (i.e. deduplicated, replaced
emojis with unicode, anonymized user tags, and
removed non-English posts) to retain 3.1M posts
from 2.1M unique users spanning from 2021 to
2023.
As a first step in Frame Discovery , we only
considered posts discussing public attitudes and
opinions on homelessness, following Boydstun and

3Gross‚Äôs (2013) Public Opinion frame. We dis-
carded posts which we deemed ambiguous, under-
specified or unrelated (e.g. political homelessness).
We also discarded posts containing first person
lived experiences of PEH, since our focus was on
studying public attitudes on homelessness.
Next, we followed an extensive iterative ‚Äòcod-
ing‚Äô process based on grounded theory from so-
cial science (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) to sur-
face our OATH-Frames where ‚Äòcodes‚Äô are 1-2 word
descriptors of the data. The coding process in-
volved our four domain experts independently an-
alyzing a sample of 100 posts to conceptualize a
unique categorization of attitudes. This was fol-
lowed by a discussion where all posts were re-
viewed and similar frames were grouped together
till we reached consensus on definitions, edge cases
and representative examples. We repeated this
process thrice on different sets of posts with re-
fined iterations of our frames until we reached the-
matic saturation which surfaced nine fine-grained
Issue-specific frames under homelessness; see
ourOATH-Definitions in Table 1. Appendix
A.1 provides our experts‚Äô OATH-Guidelines devel-
oped during Frame Discovery that contain detailed
definitions and steps on how to address edge cases.
Our Issue-specific frames can be catego-
rized into three overarching themes, as illustrated
in Figure 1 ( Frame Discovery ). First, we find
Critiques of systems and institutions enabling
homelessness and also the use of homelessness as
a vehicle to critique others (e.g. actors, programs
or spending). Second, we find posts reflecting dif-
ferent Perceptions of PEH which attribute un-
desirable characteristics to PEH to make harmful
generalizations. Third, we find many Responses
to the issue, posed as solutions, interventions, calls
to action and charitable acts. Our three themes
are consistent with those in prior work on home-
lessness (Baiocchi and Arguello, 2019; Gowan,
2010), but our work is the first to surface nine
Issue-specific (homelessness) frames provid-
ing more fine-grained insights.
3 Annotation of OATH-Frames
3.1 Expert Annotation
Our four domain experts leading the frame discov-
ery effort (¬ß2) trained two other annotators (trained
experts). The trainees first familiarized themselves
with OATH-Definitions and OATH-Guidelines
as detailed in Appendix A.1. Next, the trainees

across different annotation methods. Distribution of
OATH-Frames across annotation strategies is similar.
See more details in Table 4 in Appendix C.
labeled 20 posts with OATH-Frames where the ex-
perts clarified questions about OATH-Definitions .
Finally, the trainees performed an independent an-
notation exercise on a set of 280 posts annotated by
the domain experts. The training concluded once
the trainee achieved moderate agreement (Fleiss‚Äô Œ∫
> 0.4 ; Fleiss, 1971) with the experts.
For all relevant posts, each expert (domain and
trained) annotator performs a 9-way-multilabel
classification of Issue-specific frames, where
54% of the posts were labeled with more than one
frame. Co-occurrence of frames represented multi-
ply expressed attitudes highlighting the complex-
ity of our task. All annotators achieved an aver-
age inter-annotator agreement of 0.46 (Fleiss‚Äô Œ∫)
and a macro F 1of 0.55 (see Table 2) across nine
Issue-specific frames.5
Overall, we considered 5.3K posts, of which
we filtered out 1.2K posts, leaving 4.1K expert-
annotated posts. See Appendix B.1 for details on
our inter-annotator agreement, co-occurrence of
frames and annotation interface.
3.2 LLM-Assisted Expert Annotation
Given the nature of the rhetoric on homelessness,
annotating 5.3K posts was laborious, and emotion-
5Our agreement across 9 frames is ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô; prior work
has reported similar agreement of 0.3-0.4 across 8 frames and
4 annotators in a multi-label classification task (Stede et al.,
2023). We calculate the agreement across six annotators, a
much higher number than prior work that considers only two
annotators (Card et al., 2015).
4Task: You are an AI model trained to classify social media posts related to homelessness into 9 different frames according to our definitions below. OATH-Definitions:  <harmful_generalization>: Blanket states that generalize a negative, harmful or undesirable attribute to all people experiencing homelessness‚Ä¶  <government_critique>: Criticism about the government body, policies and laws including discussion of homelessness through the lens of political parties and values‚Ä¶ Instruction: In concise points, carefully assess the relevant frame(s) that best characterize the content of the post: <hey @mention would it be able to get a better package? You got it set to homeless edition nd it‚Äôs terrible to work with‚Ä¶ how am I supposed to use all my crayons?>; try to list all the labels that are applicable for the post. Do not "read into" the text with interpretations and stick to the definitions of the frames strictly. Each individual label should be followed by "because", followed by the reason for why that label was picked.

ally challenging for the human experts. LLMs are
now being deployed as annotation assistants in so-
cial science (Li et al., 2023; Bohra et al., 2023), but
questions on how best to incorporate insights from
social science into LLMs still remain (Nelson et al.,
2024; Gondimalla et al., 2024); also see Appendix
E.3. We explore a collaborative setting for anno-
tating OATH-Frames with LLM assistants to our
expert annotators to ameliorate their manual and
emotional labor. We first investigate the ability of
GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) to do our annotation
task stand-alone (¬ß3.2.1), before describing our
collaborative framework ( Expert+GPT-4 ; ¬ß3.2.2).
3.2.1 Predicting OATH-Frames with only GPT-4
We design our prompts for GPT-4 by incorpo-
rating instructions and examples as well as our
own OATH-Guidelines andGPT-4 ‚Äôs own Chain-
of-Thought reasoning (CoT; Wei et al., 2022), in
an iterative setup as shown in Figure 3. Build-
ing on prior work (Pangakis et al., 2023; Ryt-
ting et al., 2023), we observe that CoT serves
as a signal to understanding misinterpretations of
OATH-Definitions and benefits from addition of
expert annotator guidelines ( OATH-Guidelines ).
Our prompt refinement pipeline could be general-
ized to other social science tasks, where practition-
ers could use LLM CoT and their expert annotator
guidelines to leverage LLMs as annotation assis-
tants. Appendix B.2 details the prompts we used.
We report GPT-4 ‚Äôs performance on a subset of280 multiply-annotated posts6(|Dagreement |=280)
in Table 2. GPT-4 achieves a precision of 0.39
¬±0.05 and recall of 0.64 ¬±0.05 across all nine
Issue-specific frames showing that it may have
reasonable coverage of the predicted labels but also
produces false positives due to the inherent social
nuances in the posts that may be easier for a expert
to resolve. For example, GPT-4 often confuses the
SocCrit. and GovCrit. frames, seen in the fol-
lowing post: ‚Äò@mention it appears the problem in
el paso with illegal aliens were solved overnight,
so that you could have a photo op without any-
one seeing hundreds of homeless illegals on the
streets‚Äô . Here, although the government is not
explicitly mentioned, politicians often enact dis-
placement sweeps and photo-ops to disguise the
severity of the homelessness crisis. We observe
thatGPT-4 is not able to resolve domain-specific
references (i.e. displacement sweeps) and thus pre-
dicts both SocCrit. and GovCrit. (Table 7). In
these cases, it‚Äôs important to have experts validate
the predictions.
3.2.2 Predicting OATH-Frames with
Expert+GPT-4
Although LLMs serve as a useful tool to efficiently
generate annotations, the inherent subjectivity and
sensitivity of our task poses a challenge to using
GPT-4 as an annotator on its own (Rytting et al.,
2023; Heseltine and Clemm von Hohenberg, 2024).
6This allows us to compute performance within a margin
of error across all 6 (expert) annotators.

Performance of Flan-T5-Large andLlama-2-7b-chat-hf (zero-shot) are reported on 1280 singly annotated test
instances. See detailed precision and recall for each row in Appendix Table 12.
We propose an Expert+GPT-4 approach that lever-
ages both GPT-4 ‚Äôs annotation efficiency and human
expertise to verify and correct GPT-4 ‚Äôs generations.
We generate GPT-4 predictions on a set of 4.4K
posts. Through expert validation, we filter out 300
posts, resulting in 4.1K Expert+GPT-4 validated
posts. Our expert validation involves discarding
false positive labels by GPT-4 ; this results in a 12
point boost in precision and a slight drop in recall
compared to GPT-4 generations. We note that by
themselves, experts take 187.49 ( ¬±30.71) seconds,
whereas with Expert+GPT-4 , they take 28.80 ( ¬±
8.55) seconds, which is a 6.5 √óboost in annotation
speed. Overall, Expert+GPT-4 results in a 6 point
increase in macro F 1over GPT-4 ; see Table 2.
3.3 Scaling OATH-Frames Annotations
While Expert+GPT-4 reduces manual labor, an-
notations by Expert andExpert+GPT-4 are rela-
tively cost-intensive at a larger scale. To this end,
we scale OATH-Frames annotations using a model
trained with Expert andExpert+GPT-4 annota-
tions. We obtain 10.4k training examples: 5.3K
Expert and 4.1K Expert+GPT-4 annotations and
1K filtered posts. We split these into a train-val-test
split containing 8217, 913 and 1280 posts respec-
tively and train a Flan-T5-Large (Chung et al.,
2022) model for 10-way multilabel classification
(nine OATH-Frames and filter).
Results in Table 2 show that Flan-T5-Large
performs better than GPT-4 with a Macro F 1of 0.51¬±0.05, and is on par with the Expert+GPT-4 set-
ting on the Agreement Test Set ( |Dagreement |=280).
We also find that Flan-T5-Large obtains a Macro
F1score of 0.50 on a larger test set of 1280 posts
(|Dtest|=1280). Among four fine-tuned size-
variants of Flan-T5 , and zero-shot Llama-2-7b
(Touvron et al., 2023), Flan-T5-Large performs
the best; detailed results and data settings are pro-
vided in Appendix C.
Using our trained Flan-T5-Large model, we
generate OATH-Frames predictions on a set of 2.4M
unlabeled posts. Figure 2 illustrates that the distri-
bution of frames under different annotation strate-
gies is similar. Next, we use the 2.4M predicted
annotations in a large-scale socio-political analysis
of public attitudes.
4 Analyzing Posts with OATH-Frames
Synthesizing public opinion using online discourse
is useful for advocacy groups and policymakers to
inform homelessness services and equitable hous-
ing policies to local communities (Burstein, 2020).
We demonstrate the utility of OATH-Frames to such
end users by analyzing attitudes with respect to
state mentions, marginalized populations, and time
period on the set of 2.4M posts. We also highlight
the utility of our OATH-Frames over sentiment and
toxicity labels.
64.1 OATH-Frames Versus Toxicity and
Sentiment Prediction
PEH experience harms online in unique ways
through subtle stereotyping (i.e. HarmGen. : ‚Äòyou
look homeless ‚Äô; Kiritchenko et al., 2023; Hutchin-
son et al., 2020). We investigate how existing
toxicity and sentiment classifiers capture harm-
ful rhetoric against PEH as represented by the
HarmGen. frame. We plot the distribution of
Figure 4: Distributions of sentiment and toxicity scores
for posts labeled with and without HarmGen. in our
subset of 4.1K Expert -annotated posts.
the Perspective API7toxicity score and sentiment
scores (Rosenthal et al., 2017) in Figure 4 for
the subset of Expert -annotated posts labeled with
HarmGen. . We find that a majority of HarmGen.
posts are labeled with a toxicity of less than 0.5, in-
dicating a high false negative rate. For example, the
following post contains harmful stereotypes against
PEH but was tagged with a toxicity score of less
than 0.5: ‚Äò@mention some people wear clothes at
home i wear for an outing and here i dress up
like a homeless person inside my home whos a
drug addict and has been sleeping since forever‚Äô .
Furthermore, the negative sentiment distributions
for posts labeled with and without HarmGen. are
significantly similar ( independent samples t-test :
p < . 001) indicating that sentiment classifiers are
not able to represent HarmGen. against PEH. This
highlights that OATH-Frames provides a framework
characterizing how PEH may experience harms
and subtle stereotyping, going beyond sentiment
and toxicity. Our framework can serve to improve
existing classifiers in detecting such harms, es-
pecially for underrepresented communities (Dorn
et al., 2023).
4.1.1 Case Study: Solutions and Interventions
in Posts Mentioning California
Given the high rates of PEH in California (CA ac-
counted for 49% of U.S. unsheltered PEH in 2023),
7https://perspectiveapi.comwe investigate the proposed SolnInt. for posts
that mention CA. We measure the statistical preva-
lence of a term in CA posts in two subsets: posts
labeled with SolnInt. and posts labeled with
a positive sentiment probability ( p(+ve)>0.5)
(Rosenthal et al., 2017) in our set of 2.4M posts.
We calculate Monroe et al.‚Äôs (2017) weighted
(+)SolnInt. Score p(+ve)Score
rent 3.72 great 4.68
voucher 2.59 love 4.22
abandon 2.48 new 3.26
bass 4.68 thank 3.16
healthcare 2.03 help 2.32
Table 3: Log-odds ratios for terms that are statistically
more likely to appear in posts about CA labeled with (+)
SolnInt. and posts about CA with positive sentiment
(p(+ve)>0.5). Scores outside the range [1.96, -1.96]
are considered statistically significant. Full set of results
are included in Table 13.
log-odds ratio with a Dirichlet informed prior for
unigrams/bigrams. By incorporating a prior esti-
mate over the expected distribution of the vocabu-
lary, this approach accounts for words that are very
commonly or rarely prevalent in the two subsets
of posts. Table 3 shows 5 significant terms in each
subset and their z-score.
We find that in posts labeled with (+)
SolnInt. ,OATH-Frames captures more compre-
hensive insights specific to homelessness in CA.
Whereas posts labeled with a positive sentiment
(p(+ve)) contain more generic insights (i.e. ‚Äò great,
love, help ‚Äô). For example, ‚Äò abandon, voucher ‚Äô, and
‚Äòbass‚Äô refer to LA Mayor Karen Bass‚Äôs homeless-
ness initiative: ‚ÄòInside Safe‚Äô that converted aban-
doned hotels to temporary shelters for PEH (Ure-
vich, 2023) whereas ‚Äò rent‚Äô and ‚Äò healthcare ‚Äô are con-
sidered as drivers of homelessness in CA and poten-
tial entry points for interventions. Although senti-
ment classifiers provide coarse-grained insights of
conflating factors in relation to homelessness (e.g.
substance use, crime), we find that OATH-Frames
provide more targeted insights specific to CA.
4.2 Attitudes across State Mentions
Discourse on homelessness is closely tied to a
state‚Äôs social and economic climate and the preva-
lence of PEH in each region (Tsai et al., 2019). We
investigate the saliency of our Issue-specific
frames in posts that mention states in the U.S.8
8Our analysis includes the following states which were
most frequently represented in our set of 12K posts containing
7Given less than 1% of tweets are geotagged
(Ajao et al., 2015), we use NER9to segment
our data by posts mentioning different U.S. states.
We find that HarmGen. is the most prominent
Issue-specific frame in posts about California,
Washington and Oregon and (Un)Deserv. and
MoneyAid. are the most prominent in posts about
New York (see Figure 12, Table 10 in Appendix
D). To better understand the drivers of attitudes in
a state, we also estimated a linear regression for
two state level factors (i.e. cost of living index,
percent of unsheltered PEH) in relation to the pro-
portion of posts labeled with frames10as shown in
Figure 5. We find that a high cost of living index11
correlates to a larger proportion of GovCrit. (R2
of 0.61) and fewer SolnInt. whereas a larger
unsheltered PEH population correlates to more
HarmGen. (R2of 0.45) and less (Un)Deserv. .
We hypothesize that greater visibility of PEH in
the west coast, which is due to a larger unshel-
tered population (68% in California compared to
4.9% in New York), results in HarmGen. and in
contrast, posts about New York are more likely to
contain (Un)Deserv. attitudes due to an influx
of asylum seekers and immigrants in 2023 (Sousa
et al., 2023). In addition, higher costs of living
elicit more GovCrit. for economic reform and
reducing rent prices.

cost of living and percent of unsheltered PEH, predicting
proportion of frames for each state. The shaded region
represents the standard error of the fit to the true values.

10Understanding the socio-economic factors shaping atti-
tudes extends beyond cost of living and unsheltered popula-
tions (Lee et al., 1990); we leave further exploration of these
factors up to future work.

to cover basic expenses, (i.e. food, shelter) https:

cost-of-living-index-by-state4.3 Differences in Attitudes Across
Vulnerable Populations and PEH
Attitudes of (Un)Deserv. (Solas, 2018) reflect
comparisons between vulnerable populations and
PEH as being more or less deserving of aid (Kir-
itchenko et al., 2023; Hoffmann, 2019) putting
them at risk for being further ostracized from gar-
nering public support for relief and reform mea-
sures (Lalor et al., 2022). We investigate the finer-
grained differences in attitudes as characterized by
OATH-Frames when PEH are compared to other
vulnerable populations in our subset of posts la-
beled with (Un)Deserv. (Rosenheck et al., 1999;
Chishti and Gelatt, 2022).
We identify the following subpopulations of
PEH: veterans, people, immigrants, refugees, amer-
icans and the following vulnerable populations:
asylum seekers, immigrants, refugees, illegal aliens,
Ukrainians amongst the most frequently occur-
ring bigrams in our data. We extract a subset of
153K posts (out of 2.4M posts) mentioning these
terms. ‚ÄòHomeless Veteran‚Äô, ‚ÄòHomeless People‚Äô and
‚ÄòHomeless American‚Äô co-occur most frequently
with ‚ÄòUkrainian‚Äô and ‚ÄòImmigrant‚Äô (see Figure 13 in
Appendix D). For each co-occurring (PEH, Vulner-
able Population) pair, we examine the most statisti-
cally significant attitudes (see Table 11 in Appendix
D). We find marked differences in attitudes when
PEH are compared to Ukrainians versus when they
are compared to immigrants. Public attitudes in
posts that compare PEH with Ukrainians appear
either as GovCrit. or appeals for MoneyAid. .
In contrast, posts comparing PEH to immigrants
elicit more nationalistic sentiment and are oriented
around relocation ( NIMBY ) and HarmGen. .
4.4 Tracking Attitudes Across Time
Geo-political events serve as catalysts for reac-
tive and inflammatory attitudes on social media.
We find that the prevalence of certain attitudes
across several months correlates with news cy-
cles that dominated the discourse on homeless-
ness. Figure 6 shows the frequency of attitudes
by month across 2021 to 2023. We observe
that GovCrit. ,SolnInt. ,(Un)Deserv. , and
MoneyAid. peaked in 12-2022, a time when ten-
sions were rising in the U.S. due to Congress
considering a spending bill with $44.9 billion in
aid for Ukrainians during the Russian-Ukraine
War (Weber, 2022). This sparked comments re-
garding the prioritization of government funding
8Figure 6: Frequency of posts labeled with frames across
months in 2021-2023 in 2.4M annotated posts (Left)
and across days in posts about NY (Right).
(GovCrit. ,MoneyAid. ) amongst Ukraine and
PEH ( (Un)Deserv. ). For example, the follow-
ing post contains mentions of the spending bill
followed by a comparison to the existing homeless-
ness crisis in the country: ‚ÄòThey just approved
$45 Billion for Ukraine that‚Äôll be unaccounted
for and to be spent however they please. We
have homeless wandering the streets looking for
a warm place to get out of the cold‚Äô .
Additionally, we investigate the prevalence of
attitudes in posts about New York and find that
GovCrit. and (Un)Deserv. attitudes spike sig-
nificantly between 01-29-2022 and 02-02-2022.
The spike correlates to a $40M contract to con-
vert the hotels into temporary housing for an in-
flux of migrants (Zraick, 2023; Flanagan and For-
moso, 2023) leading to protests, increased hostil-
ity towards migrants and public opposition against
the government. Such comparisons between immi-
grants and the state‚Äôs homeless population resulted
in a spike in (Un)Deserv. and GovCrit. atti-
tudes.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
We introduce OATH-Frames which characterize on-
line attitudes towards homelessness under three
overarching themes and nine Issue-specific
frames. We annotate posts using Expert ,GPT-4
andExpert+GPT-4 and use them to train a model
to predict OATH-Frames on a large collection of
2.4M posts. We show that modeling OATH-Frames
offers distinct advantages over existing models for
toxicity and sentiment classification, and reveals
nuanced attitudes in relation to states, marginalized
populations, and over time.
We hope to expand OATH-Frames to include
more context such as target groups, or correlated
factors (e.g., substance use and mental illness). Our
work serves as a blueprint for building frameworksthat incorporate insights from social science ex-
perts for different large-scale socially sensitive an-
notation tasks. We expect OATH-Frames to serve as
a tool for social science practitioners in analyzing
attitudes towards complex social issues at scale .

Limitations and Ethical Considerations
LLMs as Annotation Assistants One limitation
of using LLMs as annotation assistants for socially
sensitive tasks is the potential for harmful biases
to be reflected in the predictions. LLMs have been
shown to reflect biases (Feng et al., 2023; Gallegos
et al., 2023) that are considered harmful to under-
served communities (Kiritchenko et al., 2023). We
are still understanding the capabilities of LLMs
in contextualizing and reasoning about sensitive
topics such as homelessness that are contingent on
complex social and political norms. As a result, we
ensure our annotations are validated by experts in
social science to mitigate the propagation of harms
reflected by LLMs. An interesting avenue for fu-
ture work would be to more effectively scale up
large scale annotations for socially sensitive set-
tings by better allocating expert intervention where
necessary.
Diversity of Attitudes Given that we do not
know the demographic background or geographi-
cal origin of the post, our framing typology may
not necessarily be representative of attitudes to-
wards homelessness outside the U.S. Homeless-
ness is viewed differently depending on regional-
ity, ideology, political and economic status among
9other socio-political factors that might not be rep-
resented in our dataset. Our framing typology may
have introduced our own prior biases in reasoning
about these posts that may not be in direct align-
ment with the general public‚Äôs attitudes towards
homelessness.12The use of LLMs could further
exacerbate societal biases in reasoning about an
already marginalized population. This is an im-
portant consideration while using OATH-Frames
in making generalizations about attitudes towards
homelessness.
Data Collection via Keyword Search Our col-
lection of Twitter posts was restricted to those that
contained the keyword ‚Äòhomeless‚Äô but there are
many other terms to reference PEH, which could
be explored in future work.13
Privacy Due to the diversity of our dataset
and lexical diversity of social media posts, we
anonymized user handles, and did not obtain or
use any priors about the user from their profile or
follower network; however, prior work has shown
that demographic background could be useful (Tsai
et al., 2019). We only rely on the content of the
post and the timestamp (time at which the post was
created) for our study.
Confounders We did not consider additional so-
cial, political and economic confounders that can
point to why some attitudes are more salient than
others. For example, substance use and mental ill-
ness may influence the public‚Äôs opinion about PEH
(Baiocchi and Arguello, 2019). OATH-Frames can
serve as the foundation for identifying such factors
which can further corroborate the statistical preva-
lence of certain attitudes over others. Furthermore,
taking into consideration the target group of the
post may provide more finer grained signals as to
who the attitude is directed at and help better clas-
sify harmful rhetoric towards PEH (Kiritchenko
et al., 2023). Initially, we considered the character-
ization of these additional factors which are shown
in Figure 8, but it‚Äôs extremely difficult and labo-
12Our annotation team consisted of domain and trained
experts from social work and computer science from a mix of
backgrounds including 4 from the U.S., 1 from India, and 1
from China.
13Initially, we started with a much larger set of seed words
including: ‚Äúhomeless, homelessness, unhoused, unsheltered,
encampment, tent, houseless, living on the streets, hobo, doss,
bag lady, mendicant, couchsurf, housing benefit, street people,
soup kitchen, roofless, vagabond, down-and-out, destitute‚Äù,
but we found that this returned content not necessarily related
to homelessness.rious to label posts at scale with more than 50+
frames and labels. We leave it up to future work to
characterize additional social and political factors
that can provide important and necessary context in
elaborating the statistical prevalence of the frames
in our dataset.

AOATH-Frames Discovery
We provide an overview of an earlier iteration
ofOATH-Frames in Figure 7 where we had close
to 50 Issue-specific frames across six differ-
ent themes. Following the ‚Äòcoding‚Äô process from
grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967), we re-
fined our frames after consensus discussions. In our
primary iterations, we also considered annotating
factors that are often conflated with homelessness.
Examples of such factors include substance use
and mental illness. Such factors provide important
context for how public opinion can be influenced
by the social and economic climate of a particular
region. We provide details of these factors in Fig-
ure 8 and leave this up to future work as an exten-
sion of OATH-Frames . In the following section, we
outline our expert annotation OATH-Guidelines
developed during Frame Discovery that contain
clarifications of our definitions, common questions
that came up during the annotation process and
steps on how to address edge cases. We find thatincorporating such insights from domain experts in
our prompt refinement guided by CoT explanations
improves annotation performance on our task.
A.1 OATH-Guidelines
1.References to homelessness as lowest point,
or linguistic structure of ‚Äúlisting‚Äù: ‚Äòthe coun-
try is in shambles, immigration sucks, infla-
tion is up, and homeless crisis is up‚Äô ‚Üíare
GovCrit.
2.Posts that fall under HarmGen. are references
to homelessness as lowest point, usually these
posts read ‚Äòi‚Äôd rather be homeless than ...‚Äô
3.SolnInt. can be expressed in many differ-
ent ways: volunteering, advocacy etc. If
someone is defending PEH from harmful
stereotypes, tag with both SolnInt. and
HarmGen.
4.If someone is advocating against a specific
harmful stereotype ‚Äì label as HarmGen. and
SolnInt. , otherwise, neutral sentiments and
positive comments about PEH can be labeled
asInteract.
5.HarmGen. coupled with SolnInt. means
defending against a specific harmful stereo-
type
6.HarmGen. on its own or coupled with
Interact. means person writing the post
is making a harmful stereotype
7.If no harmful stereotype is mentioned and per-
son is just making a positive comment about
PEH: Interact. , possibly SolnInt.
8.Metaphors/similes ascribing homelessness
with negative qualities should be tagged with
HarmGen.
9.If comparing homelessness to other is-
sues and discussing prioritization of issues:
(Un)Deserv. , potentially SolnInt.
10.‚Äòlooking homeless‚Äô implying PEH have a dirty,
unkempt appearance is HarmGen.
11.There is a difference between one experience
of PEH doing something harmful vs. gen-
eralizing this attribute to PEH as a whole.
HarmGen. referring to generalizations made
about PEH population as a whole as opposed
to one incident.
1312.If specifically discussing how money, aid or
resources should be allocated across PEH vs.
other groups such as immigrants or refugees,
tag with MoneyAid.
13. GovCrit. also include posts which point out
political parties by name explicitly ‚Üíyou‚Äôre
looking for a juxtaposition between parties,
for e.g using democratic ideals specifically to
critique the party‚Äôs response to homelessness
in comparison to republican ideals
14. SolnInt. includes calls to action which are
more directed and pointed and often more
declarative in nature, For ex. ‚ÄòHurry up govs!‚Äô
or includes critiquing or discussing specific
solutions
15.Statements like: ‚Äúthe city is so great, why
do you have homelessness‚Äù should be tagged
with GovCrit.
16.When the post is critiquing a solution or
is questioning a solution of intervention,
it should be augmented with additional la-
bels from the Critiques theme along with
SolnInt. .
17.If there is critique of solutions funded by the
government or government sponsored, then
label as GovCrit.
18.Google names of politicians if they show up
(GovCrit. frame often names politicians,
if you suspect that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing and
don‚Äôt recognize the name, then google to con-
firm)
19. Don‚Äôt open links to external sources
20.If the post mentions policing of homelessness,
consider tagging with GovCrit. since this is
government mandated
21.Critiquing of how the ultra-rich are donating
money is MoneyAid.
22.discussion/debate around contributing factors
to homelessness: SolnInt. potentially
23.If someone is defending PEH from harmful
stereotypes, tag with both SolnInt. and
HarmGen.24. HarmGen. on it own or coupled with
Interact. ‚Üíperson is making a harmful
stereotype
25.If author of the post is expressing prejudice
against PEH ‚Üítag with HarmGen. . If the
author of the post is calling out prejudice, tag
with HarmGen. and SolnInt.

Figure 7: OATH-Frames v1: Our first itera-
tion of OATH-Frames included more themes and
Issue-specific frames. We went applied principles
from grounding theory to iterate on our typology to
more closely capture public opinions and attitudes to-
wards homelessness.

We show our dataset splits for each annotation strat-
egy in Table 4.

public party was sending asylum seekers across the
country, predominantly to blue states; this resulted
in a lot of immigrants becoming homeless and also
resulted in a news cycle that pitted immigrants
against PEH in competition for jobs, housing and
funding (Abdalla, 2022). Furthermore, GovCrit.

against government institutions and politicians is
often in the context of funding and resource al-
location. HarmGen. co-occurs frequently with
NIMBY and Interact. .NIMBY rhetoric can be
expressed in harmful and exclusionary ways to-
wards PEH, and furthermore, personal interactions
with PEH can elicit more harmful stereotyping.
We provide details of our inter-annotator agree-
ment scores in Figure 10 and an example of our
Amazon Mechanical Turk Sandbox annotation in-
terface in Figure 11. The expert first determines
whether the post should be filtered out if it is not
relevant to public attitudes towards homelessness.
For relevant posts, the expert must select at least
one or more Issue-specific frames to label the
post. We provide examples of our expert annotated
posts in Table 5.
B.2 LLM-Assisted Expert Annotation
We include the final prompt that we achieve after
iterating through the OATH-Frames instructions, for
obtaining GPT-4 annotations (Table 6).
Our prompt consists of a two-step process: (1)
Using the Public Opinion prompt to filter rele-
vant posts, followed by (2) Using OATH-Frames to
get multi-label Issue-specific frames for each
post. We provide examples of using CoT and ex-
pert observations to incorporate OATH-Guidelines
in Table 8. We also included examples of frames
with the highest false discovery rates and highest
precision as predicted by GPT-4 in Table 7.

here we are - back to people proving who they are. should homeless people get a chance to vote?
people who ran away from home and don‚Äôt have a birth certificate? why can you buy a gun w/o an

10400 posts. We then split these posts into a train-
validation-test split using the following criteria:
‚Ä¢We ensure roughly an 80:10:10 proportion for
the above mentioned split.
‚Ä¢The test set contains only domain-expert anno-tated posts. We pick 280 posts that were used
in our agreement set in ¬ß2, and add another
1000 instances to the pool. This overall set of
1280 posts is used to pick the best perform-
ingFlan-T5 variation for final inference on a
larger set of posts.

annotator is asked to select labels that apply the most to a given post. The time taken for each annotation is also
recorded in the backend. This interface details an earlier iteration of OATH-Frames that included a larger number of
Issue-specific frames.
‚Ä¢The remaining set of domain-expert annotated

We use the pre-trained Flan-T5 models for the
conditional generation task, pooled from the
HuggingFace14repository. The task is structured
as follows:

frames. Note, this is slightly different from
how GPT-4 predictions are generated where
GPT-4 is prompted in a sequential manner
to first filter out the posts according to the
Public Opinion filter and then predict the
Issue-specific frames on the remaining
posts whereas we use Flan-T5 to predict
thePublic Opinion filter in conjunction with
the 9 Issue-specific frames all at once.

17Public Opinion prompt
System Prompt : You are an AI model trained to classify tweets related to homelessness into 2 different labels. The labels are
‚ü®attitude_towards_homelessness ‚ü©and‚ü®other‚ü©.
Label Descriptions: - ‚ü®attitude_towards_homelessness ‚ü©: Includes tweets about homelessness to talk about another topic or are generally about the social
issue of homelessness. They cover a range of topics related to homelessness, including criticism of government bodies, institutions, or political parties,
discussions about the allocation and disbursement of money, aid, and resources, criticism of societal attitudes towards homelessness, debates about who
is more deserving of resources, harmful generalizations or stereotypes about homeless people, opposition to having homeless people in local areas or
neighborhoods, references to media portrayals of homelessness, anecdotes about interactions with homeless people, and suggestions or ideas for solving
the homelessness crisis.
-‚ü®other‚ü©: Includes personal anecdotes from people experiencing homelessness who are sharing their personal experience while being homeless or asking
for assistance and aid. This category does NOT include tweets about fictional characters and personal interactions with other homeless people. Includes
statements that are nonsensical or difficult to decipher and require access to additional resources like links, media, images, etc in order to properly
interpret the tweet or references to homeless animals or being politically homeless.
Prompt : Classify the following tweet into one of the provided labels:
"post"
In concise points, please provide the relevant label that best characterizes the content of the tweet. Do not "read into" the text with interpretations,
stick to the definitions of the categories strictly. The format should be the predicted label, followed by "because", followed by reason. Do not add any
additional text.
Feel free to reference the label descriptions to support your classification. Provide any relevant context that influenced your classification.
OATH-Frames prompt
System Prompt : You are an AI model trained to classify tweets related to homelessness into 9 different labels. The labels include ‚ü®government_critique ‚ü©,
‚ü®money_aid_resource ‚ü©,‚ü®public_critique ‚ü©,‚ü®deserving_undeserving_of_resources ‚ü©,‚ü®harmful_statements_against_homelessness ‚ü©,‚ü®not_in_my_backyard ‚ü©,
‚ü®media_portrayal ‚ü©,‚ü®interaction_with_homeless_person ‚ü©, and‚ü®solutions_interventions ‚ü©.
Label Descriptions:
-‚ü®government_critique ‚ü©: criticism about the government body, government institutions or political parties including critique of specific politicians,
policies about homelessness, critique of programs that are being funded or considered by the government such as welfare programs, and the policing of
homelessness. Also includes statements where homelessness is used as a vehicle or stand-in to talk about a broader issue portraying homelessness
amongst other negative social and government problems in a list-like manner in a tweet like "murder rates, homelessness, immigration and inflation. all
suck". Also includes statements that mention names of politicians.
-‚ü®money_aid_resource ‚ü©: Primarily includes discussion of money, for long term relief of homelessness. Includes aid or resource disbursement and
allocation by government, institutions, organizations or wealthy individuals (not regular public) and also includes discussion or critique and suggestions
on how the government decides to spend money and resources. Also includes discussions of giving or providing money, aid and resources to homeless
people.
-‚ü®public_critique ‚ü©: Criticism of society in general or social norms that includes discussion of society at large instead of specific people, often pointing
out hypocrisy and critiquing society‚Äôs general attitudes towards homelessness. Also includes critiquing someone helping homelessness in order to gain
some personal benefit where someone is being explicitly called out for doing charitable acts while filming a video or for recognition.
-‚ü®deserving_undeserving_of_resources ‚ü©: Discussion of competing priorities where homelessness is compared to other issues that more or less deserve
aid and resources. Includes statements that express anti-immigration and support for policies, political initiatives and actions that restrict immigration
often comparing and prioritizing aid to people experiencing homelessness over immigrants. Also includes nationalistic statements that prioritize one‚Äôs
own nation over others including discussion about prioritizing aid and relief for veterans and the nation‚Äôs citizens over non-citizens.
-‚ü®harmful_statements_against_homelessness ‚ü©: Blanket statements that generalize a negative, harmful or undesirable attribute to all people experiencing
homelessness and invoke stereotypes and make assumptions about people experiencing homelessness as a whole. Examples include statements that say
all people experiencing homelessness are violent, addicts, thieves, mentally ill, unkempt, dirty, and poor at managing finances and also comparing
dirty, disheveled clothing to ‚Äòlooking homeless‚Äô. Includes statements that express prejudice against homelessness such as sexism, homophobia, racism,
anti-semitism and transphobia or dehumanize people experiencing homelessness depriving them of positive human qualities and viewing them as
sub-human or as trash. Includes statements that portray homelessness as the lowest point in one‚Äôs life where homelessness is used as an example of
something wrong or bad. This also includes metaphors to describe objects like anti-homeless. Could also include statements that express the desire to be
violent strictly against people experiencing homelessness including threats against homelessness. Includes statements that portray homelessness as the
lowest point in one‚Äôs life where homelessness is used as an example of something wrong or bad. This includes listing homelessness in conjunction with
other issues that are viewed as problematic or negative.
-‚ü®not_in_my_backyard ‚ü©: Opposition by residents to proposed developments in their local area, as well as support for strict land use regulations
against wanting to see homelessness in their local area and neighborhood. Also includes displacement sweeps to remove PEH from certain areas and
neighborhoods.
-‚ü®media_portrayal ‚ü©: Reference to a fictional character that is portraying homelessness and includes tweets and links about local news media.
-‚ü®interaction_with_homeless_person ‚ü©: Only includes anecdotes describing a real-life interaction with a homeless person.
-‚ü®solutions_interventions ‚ü©: Suggestions, remedies, problem solving and ideas for alleviating the homelessness crisis including support for policy reform,
existing policies and welfare programs. Includes individual people giving money, food and help for immediate relief of homelessness. Also includes
charitable acts, non-profit work, providing help and emergency aid relief, and defending people experiencing homelessness from harmful stereotypes
and generalizations and advocating for positive qualities for people experiencing homelessness. Also includes call to action statements that invoke a
sense of urgency in taking action towards helping the homelessness crisis.
Prompt : Classify the following tweet into one or more of the provided labels:
"post"
In concise points, carefully assess the relevant label(s) that best characterize the content of the tweet; try to list all the labels that are applicable for the
tweet. Do not "read into" the text with interpretations or indications or make any assumptions, and stick to the definitions of the labels strictly. Each
individual label should be followed by "because", followed by the reason for why that label was picked. Do not add any additional text. You have to
select atleast one label, you cannot leave it out.
Feel free to reference the label descriptions to support your classification. Provide any relevant context that influenced your classification.

18Issue-specific Frames Examples
(Un)Deserv.
(Highest False Discovery)Post: mention we have 600,000 homeless and you sound self-centered. typical capitalist mindset.
Predicted CoT : Because the post mentions the number of homeless people, implying that resources should be
allocated to them, and criticizes the individual for not prioritizing this issue.
Observation : The post uses homelessness as an example to critique an individual,
but the CoT makes implications of PEH being in competition for resources when
there is not enough information in the post to make that claim.
Post: mention furthermore this city has at least three homeless shelters available for these people
- they just have to stay sober.
Predicted CoT : Because the post implies that homeless people are undeserving of shelter if they can‚Äôt stay sober,
suggesting a condition for them to receive resources.
Observation : The post does not imply that PEH are in competition for resources, rather it is making a harmful
generalization about substance use.
Interact.
(Highest False Discovery)Post: mention are you helping homeless british people including veterans?
Predicted CoT : Because the post is addressing someone (presumably a person or organization) about their actions
towards homeless people, which can be seen as a form of interaction.
Observation : It is not clear if this post is talking about a one on one interaction with PEH, the CoT is generalizing
and reading into the post.
Post: mention wonder if any one here has
offered up a room to the many thousands of irish homeless
Predicted CoT : Because the post is suggesting that the individuals addressed could have a direct interaction with
homeless people by offering them a room
Observation : The post does not mention a direct interaction with PEH and the CoT implies that GPT-4 is reading
into the post.
HarmGen.
(Highest Precision)Post: mention how are they a nuisance? i‚Äôd rather have that than the homeless;
their garbage littering public spaces.
Predicted CoT : Because the post generalizes all homeless people as a nuisance and associates them with littering
public spaces, which is a negative stereotype.
Observation : The CoT correctly identifies that PEH are all being portrayed as a nuisance which can be considered
a negative stereotype.
Post: mention furthermore this city has at least three homeless shelters available for these people
- they just have to stay sober. they‚Äôre out there by their f*cken choice
Predicted CoT : Because the post generalizes that all homeless people are choosing to stay on the streets due to
their inability to stay sober, which is a harmful stereotype.
Observation : The CoT reasoning correctly identifies the harmful generalization about PEH and substance use, and
that all PEH are responsible for their own plight.

obviously not from the city cause bratton is a notorious bigot who hates the homeless, blacks and the poor. he said
what he said and he meant what he meant... and what he meant was ‚Äúhomeless people are a nuisance.‚Äù his record
speaks for itself. but go on...
Predicted CoT : because the post criticizes a specific government figure, Bratton, for his alleged negative attitudes
towards the homeless, blacks, and the poor. The user is critiquing his policies and statements about homelessness.
Observation : The CoT reasoning correctly identifies critique against William Bratton, the NYC law enforcement
officer.
Post: mention mention big ron is the one who destroyed the institutions that
held our mentally ill. he put them on the streets that added thousands of homeless and mentally ill people to live like
animals. and people think the republicans are there to help all the conservatives, wrong! just the rich.
Predicted CoT : because the post criticizes a specific politician ("big ron") for his policies that allegedly
led to an increase in homelessness and mental illness on the streets. The post also criticizes the Republican party,
implying they only help the rich.
Observation : The CoT reasoning correctly identifies critique against a politician for his policies and political party
values.

19Post GPT-4 CoT and Expert Observation Prompt Editing: Frame Definition Clarification
what a shi*show, can‚Äôt wait
til your all gone, go volunteer

goodGPT-4 CoT: SocCrit. : because the tweet criticizes
a group of people and suggests they should do some-
thing beneficial like volunteering at homeless shel-
ters.
Expert Observation: The generated CoT is not in-
correct, however, GPT-4 was not able to capture the
call-to-action in the last part of the post. According to
OATH-Frames -Guidelines #14: SolnInt. includes
calls to action which are more directed and pointed
and often more declarative in nature. We use this
guideline to expand the definition of SolnInt. .Original Definition + Addition: SolnInt. : Suggestions, remedies, problem solving and ideas for
alleviating the homelessness crisis including support for policy reform, existing policies and welfare
programs. Includes defending people experiencing homelessness from harmful stereotypes and gener-
alizations and advocating for positive qualities for people experiencing homelessness. Also includes
individual people giving money, food and help for immediate relief of homelessness, charitable acts,
non-profit work, providing help and emergency aid relief, call to action statements that invoke a sense of
urgency in taking action towards helping the homelessness crisis
Updated CoT: SocCrit. because the tweet criticizes unspecified individuals or groups, suggesting they
should be doing more to help the homeless, such as volunteering at shelters. SolnInt. because the
tweet suggests volunteering at homeless shelters as a way to help alleviate the homelessness crisis.
... hey @mention would it be
able to get a better @men-
tion package? you got it
set to homeless edition and
it‚Äôs terrible to work with....how
am i supposed to use all my
crayons?GPT-4 CoT: GovCrit. because the tweet is address-
ing a specific entity (presumably a government body
or institution, given the context) with a critique about
a package that is described as homeless edition, im-
plying dissatisfaction with a program or policy re-
lated to homelessness.
Expert Observation: It is unclear whether the post
is addressing the government; thus we cannot reliably
assume it is GovCrit. . According to OATH-Frames -
Guidelines #8: metaphors/similes ascribing home-
lessness with negative qualities should be labeled
with HarmGen. as being in done in this post with
‚Äòhomeless edition‚Äô.Original Definition + Addition: HarmGen. : Blanket statements that generalize a negative, harmful
or undesirable attribute to all people experiencing homelessness and invoke stereotypes and make
assumptions about people experiencing homelessness as a whole. Examples include statements that
say all people experiencing homelessness are violent, addicts, thieves, mentally ill, unkempt, dirty,
and poor at managing finances and also comparing dirty, disheveled clothing to ‚Äòlooking homeless‚Äô.
Includes statements that express prejudice against homelessness such as sexism, homophobia, racism,
anti-semitism and transphobia or dehumanize people experiencing homelessness depriving them of
positive human qualities and viewing them as sub-human or as trash. Includes statements that portray
homelessness as the lowest point in one‚Äôs life where homelessness is used as an example of something
wrong or bad. This also includes metaphors to describe objects like anti-homeless. Could also include
statements that express the desire to be violent strictly against people experiencing homelessness including
threats against homelessness.
Updated CoT: HarmGen. because the tweet uses the term "homeless edition" in a negative context,
implying that something associated with homelessness is "terrible to work with". This could be seen as a
generalization that negatively portrays homelessness.
Tragedy after tragedy, we
come into work and go

Kids are murdered. Physi-
cal/mental health issues go

homeless, sick and in debt.GPT-4 CoT: SocCrit. : because the tweet criticizes
society‚Äôs indifference towards worsening conditions,
including homelessness and poverty.
Expert Observation: All the problems being listed
are social problems that can be considered the faults
of the government. According to OATH-Frames -
Guidelines #1: References to homelessness as lowest
point, or linguistic structure of ‚Äúlisting‚Äù: ‚Äòthe country
is in shambles, immigration sucks, inflation is up,
and homeless crisis is up‚Äô are GovCrit. . We mod-
ify the definition using this guideline.Original Definition + Addition: GovCrit. : Criticism about the government body, government
institutions or political parties including critique of specific politicians, policies about homelessness,
critique of programs that are being funded or considered by the government such as welfare programs,
and the policing of homelessness. Also includes statements where homelessness is used as a vehicle
or stand-in to talk about a broader issue portraying homelessness amongst other negative social and
government problems in a list-like manner in a tweet like "murder rates, homelessness, immigration and
inflation. everything is terrible!".
Updated CoT: GovCrit. because the tweet implies a critique of the government‚Äôs inability to address
worsening social conditions, including homelessness.

25E Further Related Work
E.1 Characterizing Attitudes Towards
Homelessness
Prior work characterizes public opinion and atti-
tudes towards homelessness through ethnographic
studies, surveys, content analyses and psychome-
tric analyses on small samples of human partici-
pants (Gowan, 2010; Barnett et al., 1997; Toro and
McDonnell, 1992; Agans and Liu, 2015; Kingree
and Daves, 1997). Prior studies have found that
diversity in public attitudes towards homelessness
are heavily influenced by personal experiences and
socio-demographic backgrounds. More specifi-
cally, Tsai et al. (2019) conducted a survey of 541
U.S. adults on public attitudes about homelessness
with the goal of determining socio-demographic
characteristics of survey respondents that are as-
sociated with particular attitudes. They find that
a majority of the participants who identified as
female, lower income, Democrat and were person-
ally exposed to homelessness expressed attitudes
of compassion towards PEH and believed that the
federal government should take more constructive
measures in funding and reform policies for PEH.
Similarly, Smith et al. (2023) and Mullenbach et al.
(2023) study people‚Äôs prior personal experiences
with homelessness and its effect on attitudes and
perceptions towards PEH. Prior studies also ana-
lyze how sociodemographic backgrounds of par-
ticipants influence an individual‚Äôs belief behind
the cause of homelessness through surveys (Lee
et al., 1990; Dittmeier et al., 2018; Agans and Liu,
2015; Hocking and Lawrence, 2000). Such studies
on attitudes and perceptions towards PEH play an
important role in influencing public policies that
address homelessness and restrictive housing poli-
cies (Mullenbach et al., 2023; Link et al., 1995).
Public opinion is heavily influenced by the social
and political climate. To this end, prior work have
also looked at changing attitudes towards homeless-
ness from 1990 to 2016 (Tsai et al., 2017) and 1993
to 2001 (Tompsett et al., 2006) by comparing sur-
vey responses conducted in different years and they
found increasingly more liberal and compassionate
responses towards homelessness. Beyond analyz-
ing survey responses, Baiocchi and Arguello (2019)
identifies a basic topology from ethnographic stud-
ies to identify key narratives in discourse about
homelessness: sin-talk, sick-talk, and system-talk
which characterize the causes of homelessness en-
listing criminal behavior and mental illness as pri-mary contributing factors. Although such studies
provide invaluable insights into public opinion, it
is extremely challenging to collect and analyze sur-
vey responses at a larger scale. Furthermore, prior
work has also identified shortcomings in existing
datasets and toxicity classifiers in recognizing de-
grading rhetoric against poor and disadvantaged
populations. This is because harmful language
against marginalized groups is often masked by hu-
mor and sarcasm and includes more subtle accounts
of stereotyping that may be specific to a particular
vulnerable population and thus harder to recog-
nize (Kiritchenko et al., 2023; Curto et al., 2023).
As a result, there exist few specialized datasets to
study language targeted specifically towards PEH
(Kiritchenko et al., 2023). To this end, we plan
to expand on these studies by performing large-
scale analyses on social media posts annotated with
OATH-Frames and providing a data resource that
analyzes complex, and at times, harmful attitudes
against PEH.
E.2 Quantifying Framing in Social Media
Discourse.
Framing (Entman, 1993) offers one mechanism to
understand the communicative power of language
by characterizing what people find most important
in a text. Framing has been used to analyze the
politics of homelessness and crime in New York
City to characterize responses to homelessness (Up-
ton, 2016). Furthermore, framing has also been
used to study discourse on social media for top-
ics such as immigration and politics (Mendelsohn
et al., 2021; Boydstun and Gross, 2013). Our line
of work is most similar to prior work that studies
stigma and stereotypes against PEH in the media
(Kim et al., 2023; Link et al., 1991; Leibowitz and
Krueger, 2005; Belcher and DeForge, 2012). More
specifically, Kim et al. (2023) characterize stigma
against PEH using social media posts by manu-
ally annotating 6.4k posts and defining a set of
codes that characterize different stigmatizing traits
attributed to PEH. We build on prior work that use
framing theory to surface Issue-specific frames
that characterize attitudes towards homelessness
on social media and apply OATH-Frames to study
attitudes at scale.
E.3 LLMs as an Annotation Assistant.
Collecting high quality annotations for socially
complex, and sensitive tasks is not only a labori-
ous and time consuming process, but also mentally
26taxing. Prior work have explored using LLMs as
an assistant in the annotation process to resolve
ambiguities and reduce the burden off of human an-
notators (Li et al., 2023; Rytting et al., 2023). How-
ever, Pangakis et al. (2023) test the performance
of GPT-4 across 27 annotation tasks and find that
LLM performance varies widely across tasks and is
largely dependent on the difficulty and subjectivity
of the annotation task. They suggest evaluating gen-
erated annotations with a set of high quality expert
annotations during prompt tuning. Furthermore,
Rytting et al. (2023) experiment with GPT-3 as an
annotator on its own and find that across four differ-
ent tasks, GPT-3 performs more efficiently and as
effectively as human annotators. For socially com-
plex tasks such as homelessness, we use GPT-4 as
an assistant in the annotation process while validat-
ing its predictions with human experts to leverage
both the efficiency while also maintaining of qual-
ity of LLM generated annotations. It is important
for us to validate GPT-4 predictions as LLMs have
been shown to misrepresent identity groups which
can cause downstream harms when reasoning about
problems with sensitive social implications such as
homelessness (Wang et al., 2024).
