In this study, we introduce ANGST, a novel,
first of its kind benchmark for depression-
anxietycomorbidity classificationfromsocial
media posts. Unlike contemporary datasets
that often oversimplify the intricate interplay
between different mental health disorders by
treating them as isolated conditions, ANGST
enables multi-label classification, allowing
each post to be simultaneously identified
as indicating depression and/or anxiety.
Comprising 2876meticulously annotated posts
by expert psychologists and an additional
7667silver-labeled posts, ANGSTposits a more

discourse. Moreover, we benchmark ANGST
using various state-of-the-art language models,
ranging from Mental-BERT to GPT-4. Our
results provide significant insights into the
capabilities and limitations of these models
in complex diagnostic scenarios. While GPT-
4 generally outperforms other models, none
achieve an F1 score exceeding 72%in multi-
class comorbid classification, underscoring
the ongoing challenges in applying language
models to mental health diagnostics.
1 Introduction
With the advancement of web technologies,
socialmediaplatformssuchasReddit(Gkotsisetal.,
2016; Gaur et al., 2018), Twitter (De Choudhury

information exchange. They offer an anonymous,
safe space that fosters a sense of community and
empowerment that begets in-depth mental health
∗Equal contributiondiscussions (De Choudhury and De, 2014; Berry
etal.,2017). Consequently,thereisagrowingbody
of research on " digital psychiatry " (Tsugawa et al.,
2015)thatanalyzesthementalhealthdiscourseand
languageusageontheseplatformstoenhancethe
discovery,understanding,anddetectionofmental
health concerns. However, despite significant
efforts, there exist numerous concerns regarding
the curation of these resources.
Drawbacks of Existing Data Resources. The
prevalent modus operandi for sourcing mental
health-related datasets involves crawling social
mediapoststhatareeitherintrinsictospecificonline
communities pertaining to mental health (Turcan
and McKeown, 2019) or those that bear certain
attributivewords(Moweryetal.,2016),hashtags
(Berry et al., 2017), or self-reported diagnoses
(Coppersmith et al., 2015; Yates et al., 2017).
The binary indicator of the presence or absence
of these signals is used to determine the positive
class,whilethenegativeclass 1constitutesrandomly
crawled posts. This strategy engenders highly
biased data and skewed annotations incongruous
with the real-world distribution. Furthermore, it
exacerbates the semantic divergence between the
positiveandnegativeclasses,simplifyingthetask
and diminishing its utility in real-world settings.
Wetermthisissueasthe ‘Data Source Bottleneck ’.
Moreover, these ‘ proxy diagnostic signals ’
of affiliation behavior (hashtags/community
membership) or self-reports of diagnosis provide
an easy and inexpensively means of collecting
silver-labeled data, obviating the need for hiring
professional annotators. However, as elucidated by
Ernala et al. (2019), they lack clinical grounding,
theoretical contextualization, and psychometric
validity. They presents a rather myopic approach
1In this study, we refer to the ‘control group’ more from a
machinelearningperspective–asthe‘negativeclass,’. Thatis,
‘controlgroup’ representsposts thatdonot containthe target
labels (depression or anxiety).arXiv:2410.03908v1  [cs.CL]  4 Oct 2024to labeling data as it does not consider the text’s

episodes and emotion regulation to general advice
and therapy experiences. Thus, conglomerating
themunderasinglelabelleadstonoisyannotations,
spurious correlations, and unwanted biases. We
term this quandary the ‘Annotation Bottleneck ’.
Lastly, most existing works treat mental health
disorderidentificationasbinaryclassificationtasks
– differentiating posts exhibiting symptoms of
a particular mental illness from those of the
control users. While some endeavors have been
made towards multi-class classification of multiple
mental health disorders (Cohan et al., 2018; Souza
et al., 2020; Garg et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2022a),
they fail to capture the main narrative – Mental
health conditions are not mutually exclusive. In
reality, conditions like depression and anxiety
often manifest concurrently, and a social media
post may reflect both conditions simultaneously,
necessitating multiple labels. For example,
Borba de Souza et al. (2022) identify persistent
traitsofanxietyintheRedditpostsofindividuals
experiencingdepression. Thisphenomenon,known
as comorbidity, is well-documented in psychology
research(Hirschfeld,2001;Lamersetal.,2011). By
overlookingthiscrucialaspect,currentframeworks
oversimplifythecomplexinterplayofmentalhealth
disorders, thereby limiting our ability to develop
comprehensive solutions for this multifaceted
challenge. We term this drawback the ‘Task
Bottleneck ’.
Proposed Dataset. To this end, we introduce
ANGST (ANxiety-Depression Comorbidity
DiaGnosis in Reddit Po ST), a novel corpus that
addresses the data source ,annotation , andtask
bottleneck issuediscussedabove. Specifically,we
frame comorbidity identification as a multi-label
classificationtask,whereinapostcanbelabeledas
indicative of depression, anxiety, both, or neither.
Likewise, ANGSTcan be used for traditional
binary classification of control vs mental health
group. ANGSTcomprises 2876Reddit posts
meticulouslyannotatedby 3expertpsychologists.
Our scrupulous data acquisition and filtering
pipeline ensures that ANGSTrepresents data
proximate to the real-world distribution of online
mentalhealthdiscourse. Thedepression,anxiety,and control class samples exhibit reduced semantic
divergence, rendering them more challenging to
distinguishthanincontemporarydatasetsand,thus,
better reflecting the nuances of real-world data.
Furthermore, we also compile ANGST-SILVER ,
a silver-labeled corpus of 7667Reddit posts for
comorbidity classification. This supplementary
dataset is sourced from the same distribution as
ANGST, but its annotations are derived through
a carefully tuned prompting technique using
GPT-3.5-turbo (Ouyang et al., 2022). It provides
anancillaryresourceforexploringsemi-supervised
andfew-shotlearningparadigmsinthedomainof

BenchmarkingMethods. Webenchmark ANGST,

2022b,2023),alongwithlargegenerativelanguage
models (LLMs) like LLama-2 (Touvron et al.,
2023), GPT-3.5-turbo (Ouyang et al., 2022),
and GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023). Our results
unveilintriguingfindings. WhileGPT-4emerges
as the top performer overall, the pretrained
BERT-stylemodelsfine-tunedon ANGST-SILVER
are formidable competitors. Notably, PLMs
almost always outperform GPT-3.5-turbo in
binary classification setups and Llama-2 in
both comorbidity and binary classification tasks.
However, none of the models achieve an F1
score exceeding 72%in the comorbid multi-class
classificationorsurpass 69%and75%indepression
and anxiety binary classification, respectively.
These insights prompt reconsideration on the
suitability of current language models for sensitive
and nuanced tasks like mental health diagnosis
(De Choudhury et al., 2023; Timmons et al., 2023).

Next, as outlined by Yates et al. (2017), we

this filtered corpus, we selected the top 25,000
poststhatexhibitedthehighestlinguisticalignment
with depression and anxiety cues. Specifically,
we identified and ranked posts based on their
Empath(Fastetal.,2016)andNRC(Mohammad
and Turney, 2013, 2010) sentiment scores. We
use the Empath and NRC scores to prioritize
posts that were more likely to contain pertinent
emotional and psychological indicators associated
with depression and/or anxiety, in light of prior
research that highlights their effectiveness (Liu
3https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stableet al., 2022; Castiglioni et al., 2023; Zhang et al.,
2023). Appendix Table 7 provides examples of
posts with low, moderate, and high Empath and
NRCscores,respectively. Asillustratedinthetable,
posts with higher scores show a stronger alignment
withthelinguisticcuesofdepressionandanxiety.
Finally, we randomly sample 3000posts from this
pool to form our final annotation corpus.
3.2 Data Annotation
We employed two primary and one secondary
annotator, each a trained professional psychologist.
To preserve objectivity and prevent potential
biases,weestablishedaprotocolensuringcomplete
anonymity between the annotators. Specifically,
no additional information or context beyond the
post’s content was shared with them. Moreover,
the annotators worked in isolation, ensuring
their annotations were performed independently,
precluding any collaborative influence. The
primary role of the annotators was twofold. First,
they discerned and labeled if a post signified
depressionoranxiety,indicatingtheirdecisionwith
a clear "yes" or "no." Second, highlight specific
statements in the posts to support the validity
of their judgment (see Table 1). The secondary
annotator is used to resolve conflicting annotations.
Additionally, to protect the identity of users, the

4 Yet Another Mental Health Dataset?
In this section, we conduct a comprehensive cross-
sectional analysis of ANGST. We scrutinize it
across various facets and juxtapose it with existing
mental health corpora, thereby underlining its
uniquecharacteristicsanddistinguishingfeatures.
Specifically, we compare ANGSTagainst SDCNL
(Haqueetal.,2021),DepressionReddit(Pirinaand
Çöltekin, 2018) Dreaddit (Turcan and McKeown,
2019), and DATD (Owen et al., 2020). We employ
the corpora comparison strategy as outlined by
Kulkarni et al. (2023).
4.1 Inter-Class Similarity
Hypothesis – The more similar the inter-class
samples, the more difficult it becomes to classify
the dataset. We hypothesize that due to its
neutral-seedingpolicy, ANGSTwouldexhibithigherinter-classsimilaritythanitscounterparts,thereby
rendering it more challenging.
Metrics – We utilize the Jensen–Shannon
divergence (JSD) (Dagan et al., 1997) and
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) (Gretton
et al., 2012) asmeasures to quantify the proximity
between different classes in a dataset. To calculate
MMD, we use RoBERTa embeddings (Liu et al.,
2019). Thetransformerweightswerefrozen,and
a classification head with the required number of
classlabelswasemployedforeachexperiment. A
lower value of JSD or MMD indicates that the
classdistributionsaremoresimilar,makingitmore
challenging to classify accurately.
Experiments – we generate a Laplacian
smoothed unigram and bigram distribution for
each dataset for each class. Table 2 presents
the Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) of the
pairwise selection of labels. For ANGST, the JSD
of depression, anxiety, and comorbidity versus
the control group are 0.027,0.034, and 0.036,
respectively, suggesting that the comorbid and
control examples exhibit the least similarity. The
JSD of anxiety with depression and comorbidity
is0.014and0.013, while that of depression and
comorbidity is 0.002. This low divergence is what
renders the dataset arduous to classify and is the
cause for the high disagreement in the non-control
classes.
Whenextendingtheaboveexperimentwithother
datasets,weobservethatthepairwiseJSDof ANGST
is lower than that of DATD ( 0.104), Depression
Reddit ( 0.060), and Dreaddit ( 0.056). The higher
divergence in these datasets is expected, as their
controlgroupsamplesaresourcedfromnon-mental
healthcontexts. Thus, ANGSTservesasasuperior
benchmark, as it captures the vital yet minute
differencesbetweenanxietyanddepressionmore
effectively. Results for MMD are described in
Section A.2.
4.2 Adversarial Validation
Hypothesis –Datadrift(Luetal.,2019)quantifies
the change in the feature space between two
datasets. Allsamplesintheold(source)datasetare
consideredthenegativeclass,andallthesamples
in the new (target) dataset are deemed the positive
class. Asimpleclassifieristrainedforthisbinary
classification task. A high performance suggests
the presence of discriminatory features between
the two datasets. We conjecture that due to itsmeticulous data curation and filtering pipeline and
its gold annotation scheme, ANGSTwill exhibit
significant differences compared to existing mental
health datasets.
Metrics – We analyze the performance based
on accuracy, macro-F1, ROC-AUC scores, and
Matthews Correlation Coefficient.
Experiment – The training split ( 𝑇) from the
source dataset 𝑋(𝑇)
srcis labeled as ( 𝑋(𝑇)
src=0), and
ANGST’s training split 𝑋(𝑇)
tgtis labeled as ( 𝑋(𝑇)
tgt=

5 Experimental Setup
5.1 Models
We benchmark ANGSTusing both discriminative
and generative language models. The former
include Mental-BERT base, Mental-BERT large,
Mental-RoBERTa large, Mental-XLNet base, and
Mental-LongFormer base(Ji et al., 2022b, 2023).
These models have undergone continued pre-
training (Gururangan et al., 2020) on extensive
mental health-related data collected from Reddit,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on
variousmentalhealthcorpora. Amongstgenerative
language models, we report results on Llama-2
chat models (7B and 13B) (Touvron et al., 2023),
GPT3.5-turbo (Ouyang et al., 2022), and GPT-4
(Achiam et al., 2023). We report results for both
the zero and few-shot settings.
5.2 Evaluation Criteria
We benchmark ANGSTon two tasks, providing
alternativebutcomplementaryviewpointsforour
analysis. They are as follows:•Multi-label classification where a post can
simultaneously be classified as depression,
anxiety, both, or None.
•Binary classification for depression vs non-
depression and anxiety vs non-anxiety.
Wereportthestandardweightedprecision,recall,
and F1 scores for both multi-label and binary
classification tasks. Additionally, we provide
macro-F1 scores for both tasks. In the case
of multi-label classification, we also report the
Hamming loss (Tsoumakas and Katakis, 2007),
which measures the fraction of labels for which the
predicted and actual labels disagree.It is calculated

by the total number of labels.
6 Results and Discussion
6.1 Binary Classification.
The overall binary classification results for
depression and anxiety are presented in Table
3. We observe that discriminative models
exhibit consistent performance across both tasks,
outperforming much larger models such as LLama-
2andGPT3.5-turbo. ApartfromGPT-4,allother
generative models show considerable variance in
performance in both zero- and few-shot settings.
Furthermore,thereisanoticeabledifferenceinhow
models handle depression versus anxiety.
Depression results – The fine-grained results
for depression classification presented in Table
4, demonstrate a differential performance across
labels. Models consistently exhibit higher recall
and F1 scores for the depression label compared to
the control group, indicating a stronger ability to
identify true cases of depression while accepting
lower precision. This trend signifies a model’s bias
towards minimizing falsenegatives, thus reducing
the risk of missing actual depression cases. The
comparison between discriminative models and
GPT-4 shows only a slight difference. Both GPT-
4 and Mental-XLNet achieve similar F1 scores;
however, GPT-4 exhibits superior performance
in classifying the control groups. This suggests
that while the models are effective in identifying
depression, there exists a precision trade-off that
prioritizes avoiding missed diagnoses.
Anxiety results – Table 5 shows the fine-
grained results for anxiety classification. GPT-4
significantly outperforms all other discriminativeModel TypeDepression vs. Control Anxiety vs. Control

and generative models in both zero-shot and
few-shot settings, achieving the highest F1-
scores for both anxiety ( 64.4%) and control
(83.6%). Generally, all models demonstrate better
performance for the control label across precision,
recall, and F1-score compared to the anxiety
label,indicatingaconsistentpatternofeffectively
identifyingnon-anxietycases. Furthermore,there
is a notable discrepancy between the precisionand recall for the anxiety label, with precision
significantly lower than recall. This discrepancy
suggests a high rate of false positives, indicative
of Type I errors. In practical diagnostic settings,
this could lead to over-diagnosis. A possible cause
for this issue is the imbalance in ANGSTwhere
anxiety cases are underrepresented compared to
control cases, potentially causing the models to
predict anxiety more frequently to capture most
true anxiety instances.
6.2 Multi-Label Classification.
Table 6 presents the results for multi-label
classification. We observe a consistent trend
of high recall and moderate precision. This
indicates that while the models excel at identifying
relevantlabelsandminimizingfalsenegatives,they
incurr high false positives. Notably, the models
demonstrate superior performance in predicting
depression compared to anxiety, as evidenced by
consistently higherF1 scoresfor depression. This
disparity could stem from the more pronounced
or readily learnable language features associated
withdepressioninthedataset. GPT-3.5Turbowith
few-shotpromptingstandsoutasthemosteffective,
achieving an overall balanced F1 score of 71%,
with noteworthy scores of 53%for depression and
17.9%for anxiety. On the other hand, PLMs that
are characterized by lower Hamming Loss, adopt
a more conservative prediction approach, likely
reducing false positives but potentially missing
some true positives. In contrast, GPT-4, with its
higherF1scoresandgreaterHammingLoss,adopts
a more liberal approach, enhancing its ability toMethod Prompt Hamming Loss Precision Recall F1 macro-F1 depression F1 anxiety F1

7 Error Analysis
7.1 Few shot vs Zero Shot
Fromourqualitativeanalysis,weobservethatzero-
shotpromptingoutperformsfew-shotlearning. Out
of334samples where the predictions of the two
approachesdiffered,thezero-shotpromptcorrectly
classified 241samples that the few-shot prompt
misclassified. Only 4/241samples were actually
labeled as depressed in the ground truth, while
the remaining 237were non-depressed instances.
Notably,all 4ofthesedepressedexamplescontained
self-diagnosis statements, which the few-shot
approach failed to identify correctly (see Table
12). For anxiety classification, out of the 468
samples where the predictions differed, the zero-
shotapproach correctlyclassified 363non-anxiety
samples that the few-shot approach misclassified.
We observe that slight anxious behavior mentioned
in the posts is aggressively classified as an anxiety
disorder by the few-shot approach, despite the
ground truth indicating non-anxiety
Uponqualitativeanalysisofthesemisclassified
samples, we hypothesize that the few-shot prompts
maybeinducingnoiseandbiasbyovergeneralizing
from the limited examples provided in context.
Specifically, many non-depressed posts contain
mentionsofdepressivesymptoms,whichthefew-
shot model appears to heavily weight, leading
to false positive predictions. This can also be
attributed to the fact that the in-context learning
examples are silver labeled, the retriever is notpotent enough to understand the minutiae in the
semantics, or LLM’s ability to handle long context.
7.2 Error-Analysis – The Battle of the GPTs
BothGPT-3.5-turboandGPT-4showalimitation
in assessing the temporal aspect of depression.
Among the 761samples misclassified by both
models, only 42samples with a true label of
"depressed" were incorrectly labeled as "not
depressed."Themodelsstruggledtodifferentiate
betweenpastandpresentstatesofdepression(Refer
Table13). Focusingonzero-shotdepression,atotal
of334samples differed for GPT-3.5-turbo vs GPT-
4. Out of these, GPT-4 demonstrated superior
performance,with 270samplescorrectlyclassified,
while GPT-3.5 provided incorrect classifications.
Amongthe 270sampleswhereGPT-4wasaccurate,
251 instances were correctly identified as non-
depressed, contradicting GPT-3.5’s classification
as depressed. This finding highlights GPT-4’s
enhanced contextual understanding and ability to
differentiatebetweengenuinedepressivesymptoms
and non-depressive states, thus avoiding the
over-classification of non-depressive instances as
depressed.
8 Conclusion
In this study, we propose ANGSTa novel dataset
aimed at bridging critical gaps in the comorbid
diagnosis of depression and anxiety from social
media posts. By embracing a multi-label
classificationapproach, ANGSTpromotesresearch
inearlydetectionandunderstandingofcomorbid
depression and anxiety conditions, which are often
co-occurringyetunderservedbyexistingdatasets.Ourbenchmarkingexperimentswithstate-of-the-
art language models, including both discriminative
and generative methods, highlight the superior
performance of GPT-4 in both binary and multi-
label classification tasks, reflecting its advanced
capabilitiesinsymptomidentificationandcontext
understanding. Conversely, LLMs such as GPT-
3.5andLLaMaunderperformrelativetodomain-
specific PLMs like Mental-XLM, underscoring
the inherent challenges and limitations of these
models in handling the complexity of mental
health diagnosis from text. However, despite
these advancements, all models demonstrated a
tendency to misclassify complex cases, indicating
a need for improved methods that can differentiate
the subtleties of mental health language and
symptom expressions, especially in settings where
disorders co-occur. In the future, we aim to
explorehybridmodelsthatcombinethestrengths
of both discriminative and generative approaches
to improve the accuracy and reliability of mental
health assessments based on social media data,
ultimatelycontributingtothedevelopmentofmore
effective tools for early diagnosis and intervention,
thus improving outcomes for individuals with
mental health needs.
9 Limitations
This study has several limitations that future
research could address. Firstly, our data collection
from Reddit was constrained by time limitations
and a finite search space, leading to potential
blind spots in identifying users’ self-disclosure.
There may be rare expressions of self-disclosure or
posts from non-mental health related subreddits
were we missed curating ANGST. Additionally,
our dataset only includes text, omitting other
potentially informative modalities. For instance,
the timing of posts could indicate insomnia or
social relationship issues, which are early signs
of depression or anxiety. We also limit our
study to two disorders - depression and anxiety,
and include posts in English only. Moreover,
as discussed in section 6, the performance of
all baseline models in classification tasks is far
from ideal. Both generative and discriminative
models,includingGPT-4,consistentlyexhibitlow
precision, which shows that they are prone to
false diagnoses. Therefore, while these models
could serve as preliminary tools for individuals
unaware of their mental conditions or those unabletoaccessmentalhealthservices,theirpredictions
mustberigorouslyreviewedbyprofessionalsbefore
confirming a diagnosis.
10 Ethical Considerations
Socialmediadatacanbehighlysensitive,especially
when pertaining to mental health. Thus, it is
imperativetoprioritizeprivacyandrecognizethe
potential risks posed to individuals represented
withinthedata(HovyandSpruit,2016;Šusteretal.,
2017;Bentonetal.,2017). Giventhisconsideration,
we assert that the risks tied to the data used in this
study are minimal. Our assessment is corroborated
by prior studies which have introduced similar
datasets (Coppersmith et al., 2015; Milne et al.,
2016; Losada and Crestani, 2016)
TheANGSTdataset solely consists of publicly
accessible Reddit posts. We diligently remove any
information that could disclose an author’s identity
ordemographics. Weprovidedannotatorsonlywith
anonymized posts and ensured their commitment
to neither deanonymize nor contact the authors.
Moreover, we extensively adhere to the ethical and
privacyguidelinessetforthby(Bentonetal.,2017).
We do not collect any identifiable information, and
we securely store all data on protected servers,

thecreators. Theinstitutionalreviewboard(IRB)at
our institution has classified our experiments using
these datasets as exempt from additional review.

A.1 Curating ANGST-SILVER
SinceANGSTservesexclusivelyasatestbenchmark,
wecompiled ANGST-SILVER asacomplementary
corpus suitable for few-shot learning or supervised
fine-tuning. Given the complexity and length
of the posts, which demand considerable human
and financial resources, we utilized LLMs for
annotation. Recent advancements in GPT-based
solutionshaveshownthemtobeeffectivesubstitutes
for human labeling, aligning well with human
judgments in both clinical and non-clinical tasks
(Wang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023; Du et al.,
2023; He et al., 2024). Furthermore, Li et al.
(2023)demonstratedthatgeneratingexplanations
alongsidetargetlabelsenhancesthequalityofsilver
labels,achievingahighercorrelationwithcrowd-
sourced annotations. Leveraging this approach,
we employed GPT-3.5-turbo(Ouyanget al., 2022)
togeneratesilverlabelsfortheremaining 22,124
postsinazero-shotsetting. Usinganopen-ended
prompt, as detailed in Table 17, we directed the
LLM to identify and rationalize cues related to any
mentalhealthdisorderthatmaybeattributedwith
the post. After analyzing GPT-3.5-turbo outputs,
we retained 7,667posts identified with depression
and/or anxiety and discarded the rest, thus forming
ANGST-SILVER .
A.2 Inter-Class Similarity – Case study of
MMD
We report the mean MMD over 1000 runs with
a random label-wise pair chosen at each run
without replacement. In ANGST, we observed
that the MMD between the control group and
the groups representing anxiety, depression, and
comorbidity is notably higher (0.47) than the
MMD among the latter groups themselves (0.42).
This observation suggests that distinguishing
between anxiety, depression, and comorbidity
poses a relatively greater challenge compared to
distinguishing the control group from the other
classes. Furthermore, when we compare the
MMDofANGSTtootherdatasets, wefindthatour
dataset exhibits a significantly lower MMD. This
observationcorroboratesourhypothesisthat ANGST
presents a higher difficulty level in classification
tasks due to the increased proximity between its
class distributions.A.3 Hyperparameter Tuning
Ww fine-tune the BERT-based models on
ANGST-SILVER . We vary the learning rate within
the{2−5,2𝑒−6}range and experiment with
batch sizesof{4,8,16,32}. Wetrain each model
for30epochs with early stopping applied after
10epochs of no improvement in validation F1
score. We use the Adam optimizer with decoupled
weight decay regularization of 10−2(Loshchilov
and Hutter, 2017). For generating the outputs from
the LLMs, we use top-p decoding with 𝑝=0.95
(Holtzmanetal.,2020). Foreachhyperparameter
configuration, we run 3seeds and report the
averaged results. We apply this hyperparameter
setupacrossdepression,anxiety, andcomorbidity
classification tasks.
We useasingle consistentprompt forzero-shot
prompting of all the generative language models
in our setup, provided in Appendix A.4. For
few-shot prompting, we utilize the silver-labeled
data as the retrieval pool. For each example, we
retrieve the two most semantically similar posts
from the silver-labeled data, irrespective of its
label, to serve as in-context learning examples. We
employtheall-mpnet-base-v2modelfromsentence-
transformers (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) for
computing semantic similarity between the test
exampleandthesilver-labeleddata. Thefew-shot
prompt is also included in Section A.4.
A.4 Zero and Few-Shot Prompts
Table 9 illustrates the zero and few shot prompts
used for binary (depression vs non-depression
and anxiety vs non-anxiety) and multi-label
classification on ANGSTusing LLMs.
A.5 Other Prompting Techniques
Self-evaluation scales are commonly used by
clinicians to assess the presence and severity of
mentaldisordersbasedonresponsestostructured
questions. Each scale comprises specific questions,
andresponsesarequantitativelyscoredtodetermine
the severity of the corresponding mental disorder.
A.5.1 Depression
For the assessment of depression, two scales
were utilized: PHQ-9 (Kroenke et al., 2001) and
MADRS(Williams and Kobak, 2008).
•PHQ-9:Thisscaleconsistsof9symptoms,each

streamline responses, we converted these options
intobinaryresponses(“yes"or“no"). Themodel
was prompted to provide a JSON response based
on these inputs. Post-response parsing allowed
for calculation of the total score, which was
then evaluated against a predefined threshold
for depression.
•MADRS: Comprising10symptoms,eachrated
on a scale of 0 to 6 for severity, this scale was
adapted in our prompt to request the model to
score each symptom from 1 to 6. Post-prompt
parsing facilitated computation of the total score,
which was subsequently compared against the
specified threshold for depression.
A.5.2 Anxiety
Foranxietyassessment,thescaleschosenwereBAI
(Beck et al., 1993) and Hamilton Anxiety (Maier
et al., 1988) Rating Scale.
•Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale: This scale
involves 14 questions, each scored from 0 to 4,
evaluatingvariousanxietysymptoms. Themodelwas promptedto assignascore toeachsymptom,
and the cumulative score was calculated to
determine anxiety severity.
•BAI (Beck Anxiety Inventory): Consisting of
21symptoms,eachratedfrom0to4,thisscale
was utilized by prompting the model to assign
scores to each symptom. Post-prompt parsing
of the model’s output allowed for computation
of the total score, enabling assessment against
established anxiety thresholds.
A.5.3 Results
Depression: Table 10 shows the classification
scores for depression using MADRS and PHQ-
9 ((Kroenke et al., 2001)) scales. The F1 score
fordepressionisgenerallyhigherthanthecontrol
F1 score. For the MADRS prompt, there is an
improvementinbothDepressionF1andControlF1
when moving from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4. However,
forthePHQ-9scale,theDepressionF1scoredrops
significantly,whiletheControlF1issignificantly
increased. Overall, the GPT-4 results are well-
balanced, whereas the GPT-3.5 results are more
biasedtowardsclassifyingasampleasdepressed. It
isobservedthatthemodeltendstohallucinatewhile
scoring, overestimating the presence of symptoms
not mentioned in the post. This effect is reduced in
GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5.
Anxiety: Table 11 presents the classification
scores for anxiety using the BAI and Hamilton
scales. For GPT-3.5, the Hamilton scale yields
morebalancedresultscomparedtotheBAIscale.
The GPT-3.5 scores are reasonable, but GPT-4
significantly underperforms on the Hamilton scale.Task Zero-Shot Prompt Few-Shot Prompt

A.5.4 Discussion
The obtained scores fall short of both zero-shot
and few-shot performance. This could be due to
several reasons, such as the posts not providing
sufficientinformationtoanswerallquestionsina
questionnaireaccurately. Themodel’shallucination
has a significant impact on the final score, and thiseffect becomes more pronounced as the number of
questionsin thequestionnaireincreases. Different
threshold values have been tried, but the issue
of insufficient information in the posts cannot
be eliminated. Future researchers could use this
questionnaire-based prompt to further develop and
improve the approach.Model TypeDepression Control

Ive made myself alone these past few years. I was diagnosed with depression about 1.5 years ago, and there had been so much going on with
my life, struggling with college, my father cheating on my mom, and the collapse of my longdistance relationship. The solution was to change
meds, and I finally feel like myself again. I didnt do enough research at the very beginning of my depression, so I took an SSRI, which was the
worstthingIcouldhavedonelookingback. Thesideeffectswereawful, itwaschangingwhoIwas, andultimately, itdidnthelpme, butatleast
I didnt feel like killing myself. But, now that Im here, I realize how alone I made myself, given the holidays and the parties that people my age
go to. I would have felt like a failure or a loner, but I know that can change. I feel good enough to go out and make friends. If you are isolating
yourself, I implore you, from experience, that while you may feel like shit, while you may feel like the lowest thing in the world, there are people
that care about you, so much more than you think or feel. Im here now, and Im fighting again, because thats all I can do to make my life better.
You can keep fighting, because there are so many people to believe in you. Just something I wanted to get off my chest.1 1 0

I want to live now and it sucks. I was quite depressed all through my final year of highschool and most of university. My episodes followed one
another with seemingly no end. I was diagnosed with recurring MDD. During that time I was quite suicidal and apathetic and I actually
accepted the idea of death. I liked to think death was better than this life and I honestly wouldnt have minded if I died. This was around a year
andahalfago. IactuallystartedtorecoverandwiththerightmedsandtherapyIcouldfinallysayIwasinremissionsotospeak. Theproblem
is, now Im terrified by the idea of death. Ive been having tiny existential crises one after the other. I cant just accept the void anymore and its

Does anyone else feel like theyre antidepressants made an asshole. Dont get me wrong, this is the best Ive felt in a long time. Im actually

Almost 6 days feeling great. Except for yesterday but I had BPD abandonment issues but I wasn’t exactly depressed. I’ve tracked my mood for
the past couple of days and the last time I felt depressed and sad was Jan. 9th! I don’t wanna claim victory just yet but I guess my mood
stabilizer + antidepressant have worked after a couple of months. Today my mother hugged me and told me she was very happy to see me this
well after so long, and that she loves me, always has and always will. I’m so proud of these days except for yesterday lol and I know that you

Is smoking weed while on Zoloft a bad idea. Ive been feeling a lot better thanks to Zoloft. Life is going good and I feel comfortable and
somewhat happy at times. I still have a lot of issues I need to work on which is why I go to therapy every two weeks. I sometimes think I should
go once a week but I dont know. Im also on mirtazapine and risperidone. Is there anything wrong with** smoking weed** every week? Im not
using it to cope or anything. I just use it because it is fun and relaxing. I just like to smoke and paint on canvases and listen to music. I know
how easy it is to be addicted to it. I dont smoke every single second and every single day. I mostly just smoke late at night and chill. My
