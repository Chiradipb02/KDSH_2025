Abstract
Recent advancements in image captioning have
explored text-only training methods to over-
come the limitations of paired image-text data.
However, existing text-only training methods
often overlook the modality gap between us-
ing text data during training and employing
images during inference. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Image-like
Retrieval, which aligns text features with visu-
ally relevant features to mitigate the modality
gap. Our method further enhances the accu-
racy of generated captions by designing a Fu-
sion Module that integrates retrieved captions
with input features. Additionally, we introduce
a Frequency-based Entity Filtering technique
that significantly improves caption quality. We
integrate these methods into a unified frame-
work, which we refer to as IFCap (Image-like
Retrieval and Frequency-based Entity Filtering
for Zero-shot Captioning). Through extensive
experimentation, our straightforward yet pow-
erful approach has demonstrated its e fficacy,
outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by
a significant margin in both image captioning
and video captioning compared to zero-shot
captioning based on text-only training.1
1 Introduction
The task of image captioning generates appropriate
textual descriptions for images by combining com-
puter vision (CV) and natural language processing
(NLP). With the emergence of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Vision and Language Mod-
els (VLMs), various works have studied e fficient
training methods for image captioning (Mokady
et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2023; Ramos et al., 2023).
These approaches develop e ffective captioning by
using pre-trained models with few parameters or
lightweight networks. However, these works rely
on paired image-text data, which is costly (Kim

ies have explored text-only training methods for
image captioning, aiming to solve the problem us-
ing only textual data (Nukrai et al., 2022; Li et al.,
2023; Fei et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2024; Wang
et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023).
Text-only training introduces a new direction in
which models are trained solely using text data.
Recent existing works have studied what to use
as extra cues, such as extracted nouns (Fei et al.,
2023), generated synthetic images (Liu et al., 2023;
Ma et al., 2023) for training, and extracted tags
from object detectors (Liu et al., 2023). However,
existing methods that rely on object information
are sensitive to incorrect data, and utilizing large
external models (e.g., stable di ffusion Rombach
et al., 2022 or object detectors Carion et al., 2020)
incurs additional costs. Thus, we aim to address
the problem by acquiring diverse information cost-
effectively without additional models.
The retrieval task involves finding relevant in-
formation in a database for a given query. Initially
rooted in NLP (Lewis et al., 2020), the field has
expanded into CV and into multi-modal retrieval.
Depending on the input data and database, various
retrieval methods are possible, such as image-to-
text (Ramos et al., 2023) and text-to-text retrieval
(Wang et al., 2023). In the existing text-only train-
ing study, there have been attempts to use the text-
to-text retrieval method. However, existing works
can’t address the modality gap inherent in text-only
training settings, where training is performed with
text and inference with images. In addition, such
works rely too much on retrieved captions without
considering visual information. This modality gap
and the use of a narrow scope of information may
lead to performance degradation.
To verify this, we visualize the analysis result of
the CLIP embedding feature of retrieved captions
that the model uses in training via t-SNE in Fig. 2.
The analysis is done on the COCO (Chen et al.,arXiv:2409.18046v1  [cs.CV]  26 Sep 2024Text-to-text Retrieval

2015) validation split, and the CLIP similarity-
based KNN algorithm is used for retrieval. In the
figure, there is a large di fference between the distri-
bution of features used after image-to-text retrieval
and text-to-text retrieval, which shows that a modal-
ity gap exists between image and text.
To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach
called “Image-like Retrieval,” that addresses the
modality gap between image and text data. We
inject a noise into the CLIP text feature to act as
a query in image feature distribution. Visualiza-
tion results for this approach are shown in Fig. 2
right, demonstrating that our method exhibits a dis-
tribution highly similar to that of image-to-retrieval
results and ground truth captions, unlike traditional
text-to-text retrieval methods. Indeed, when our
method is applied to the existing research (Wang
et al., 2023), performance improvements are ob-
served, as shown in Table 12.
Prior research (Wang et al., 2023) relies solely
on retrieved captions, which may include wrong in-
formation in the input caption, potentially leading
to inaccurate outputs. To address this, we design
aFusion Module that e ffectively integrates boththe original input and additional representations.
Additionally, as shown by numerous studies (Fei
et al., 2023; Ramos et al., 2023), prompts can clar-
ify the information provided to the language model.
We extract keywords from the input caption to con-
struct a hard prompt, which is fed to the LLM,
offering explicit guidance. This approach maxi-
mizes the utility of text data, guiding the model to
generate accurate and relevant captions.
Guiding caption decoder with extracted entities
from an image helps the model generate an accu-
rate description of the image. However, we find
that the previous works (Fei et al., 2023; Liu et al.,
2023) show low entity detection precision, espe-
cially when the vocabulary is large as shown in
Fig. 3. Therefore, we propose a Frequency-based
Entity Filtering technique precisely utilizing en-
tity information without relying on the vocabulary.
During inference, we utilize retrieved sentences
from images, parsing them into nouns and calcu-
lating their frequency. Then, we filter nouns with
pre-defined thresholds and curate hard prompts for
the text decoder. This simple method yields re-
markable performance improvements.Figure 2: The distribution of CLIP embedding features

In summary, our contributions are as follows:
•We propose a novel approach, Image-like Re-
trieval , which achieves e ffects similar to image-
to-text retrieval in text-only training. Then, we

tween existing and additional representations.

2.1 Text-only Captioning
The advantage of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) has
been utilized in a variety of tasks, such as image
captioning, image generation, and object detection.
In the realm of image captioning, text-only training
research is emerging that uses only text data for
learning without image data, taking advantage of
the CLIP characteristic that image embeddings and
text embeddings are learned to be close. DeCap (Li
et al., 2023) trains a text decoder using only textual
data and introduces a support memory mechanism
to project input images into the text embedding
space during inference, facilitating the generation
of captions. ViECap (Fei et al., 2023) recognizes
the main entity of text data that comes as input and
configures it as a prompt, allowing LLM to perform
object-agnostic learning based on open vocabulary
retrieval using CLIP.

Our method is illustrated in 3.3, and ViECap uses CLIP

list. We follow the way SynTIC (Liu et al., 2023) uses
DETR and employ the COCO vocabulary list. Due to
the inaccessible vocabulary list of Flickr30k, DETR
can’t be compared, and ViECap uses the VGOI (Zhang
et al., 2021) vocabulary list in Flickr30k. Our method
dominates the precision score and quantity of entities in
every setting.
ever, it has been shown that these embeddings are
located in two separate regions, with a significant
gap between the modalities (Liang et al., 2022).
This modality gap hinders the interaction between
vision and text modalities and limits the quality of
generated captions. Among the notable approaches
addressing this issue, CapDec (Nukrai et al., 2022)
assumes that the image embeddings paired with
text embeddings are located within a small radius
around the text embeddings and mitigates the gap
with noise injection. CLOSE (Gu et al., 2022) high-
lights the low cosine similarity between images and
their paired texts and uses a hyper-parameter-scaled
noise injection technique to bridge the gap.
We focus on the modality gap for retrieval from
a new perspective. Our goal is to perform text
retrieval similar to image-to-text retrieval, consider-
ing the modality gap. The distinction from existing
methods can be observed in Fig. 2 left.

Retrieval has been used in diverse ways in NLP. Im-
age captioning also benefits from retrieval modules
by incorporating novel objects and new informa-
tion into captions, allowing access to new domains

sentences using our Image-like Retrieval method. Extracted nouns are incorporated into a prompt template to form
a hard prompt. Both the input text and retrieved sentences are encoded using the text encoder. These embeddings
interact and combine through our Fusion Module before being fed into the LLM for sentence generation. During
inference, we retrieve lsentences similar to the input image and construct a hard prompt by extracting entities via
Frequency-based Entity Filtering from the retrieved sentences. The sentences are encoded using a text encoder, and
the input image is encoded using an image encoder, followed by input into the Fusion Module. The subsequent
process follows a procedure similar to the training phase.
in various ways in image captioning models. For
instance, Smallcap (Ramos et al., 2023) retrieves
captions relevant to the input image and uses them
as instructions for the text decoder. In text-only im-
age captioning, ViECap (Fei et al., 2023) retrieves
novel objects from the input image and uses them
as prompts, while Knight (Wang et al., 2023) uses
retrieved captions as text features.
Most retrieval methods are based on image-to-
text retrieval, but text-only captioning performs
text-to-text retrieval. However, during inference,
the modality gap caused by the input image leads to
poor performance. Our method carefully addresses
this issue to improve performance by considering
the gap between image and text.
3 Methods
We propose a new text-only image captioning
model, IFCap , which is illustrated in Fig. 4. Dur-
ing training, the model only utilizes text data, as
is standard for text-only training models. First, we
embed the input text using a text encoder. The text
embeddings are then fed into a mapping network to
close the gap between di fferent modalities. Finally,
the processed embeddings go through a caption
decoder to generate the output caption.Our IFCap utilizes a simple yet powerful re-
trieval mechanism and addresses the modality gap
between image and text with Image-like Retrieval
(Section 3.1). After performing Image-like Re-
trieval, we employ a Fusion Module (Section 3.2)
to merge input embeddings with the retrieved fea-
tures. During inference, we use the retrieved cap-
tions from the image to find accurate and detailed
entities with Frequency-based Entity Filtering (Sec-
tion 3.3).
3.1 Image-like Retrieval (ILR)
While text-to-text retrieval can be e ffectively per-
formed during training, it is likely to su ffer from
performance degradation during inference when
an image is provided as input due to the modality
gap. Therefore, Image-like Retrieval (ILR) aims
to perform text-to-text retrieval in a manner that
resembles image-to-text retrieval outcomes, given
text input. For this, we propose an approach that
inserts noise into the feature space of the input text,
bringing it closer to the image feature space. The
augmentation process is as follows:
First, we utilize the CLIP to embed the input text
tiand the text corpus T={ti}Nc
i=1with a text encoder
ET. Then, we introduce noise ϵr∼N(0,σ2
r)intothe embedding of input text Ti, aiming to adjust the
text features to align more closely with the image
feature space:
Ti=ET(ti),Tϵ
i=Ti+ϵr. (1)
Next, the retrieval step is performed using the noise-
injected input text Tϵ
i. To identify the descriptions
most relevant to Tϵ
i, the top- kdescriptions are re-
trieved by calculating the cosine similarity between
Tϵ
iand all sentence embeddings in the text corpus.
This process closely follows previous methods in
image-to-text retrieval (Ramos et al., 2023), with
the distinction that we perform retrieval based on
Tϵ
iinstead of images.
By utilizing this approach during training, we
can enhance the ability of a model to provide image-
like information even in a text-only training setting,
thereby narrowing the modality gap and improving
performance.
3.2 Fusion Module (FM)
In text-only image captioning, choosing which ad-
ditional information to inject into the model and
dealing with new representations with given data
appropriately are important issues. To handle this
problem, we use the attention mechanism (Vaswani
et al., 2017) to fuse input text features and retrieved
captions features to extract their meaningful inter-
action. The attention mechanism emphasizes cer-
tain important features, and due to its e ffectiveness,
it has been widely utilized in the field of captioning
(Xu et al., 2015).
We first encode input text and retrieved captions
using CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) text encoder,
then inject a Gaussian noise ϵ∼N(0,σ2)to input
text feature for relieving the modality gap between
image and text. Then we adjust the dimension of
the input text feature and retrieved captions fea-
ture to the embedding space of caption decoder
with linear layers fl1andfl2respectively, and apply
cross-attention fAttwith Teas query and Reas key,
then create fusion representation Fecontaining in-
put text and retrieved captions. Finally, Feis fed
into a trainable Mapping Network, which encodes
the overall contents of the given input. We can
summarize this process with equations.
Te=Ti+ϵ,Re=ET(ILR( Ti)), (2)
Fe=fAtt(fl1(Te),fl2(Re)), (3)
F=Map( Fe;θq). (4)The noun implies intuitive and explicit informa-
tion about objects in the image. For employing the
property of nouns, we extract entities in each train-
ing text corpus and input images. We build a hard
prompt hwith extracted entities E={e1,e2,...,en}
to make the model aware of existing entities in the
image. With retrieved captions and hard prompts
with entities, the model can learn the ability to
generate proper captions without images. We use
auto-regressive loss to optimize our projector and
caption decoder. (Details about the Fusion Module
are in Sec. 4.1).
Lθ=−1

i=1log(yi|F;h;y<i;θ). (5)
3.3 Frequency-based Entity Filtering (EF)
After retrieving lcaptions from an image, we
use grammar parser tools (e.g., NLTK Bird and
Loper, 2004) to extract nouns from the retrieved
sentences and calculate the frequency of these ex-
tracted nouns as F=[f1,f2,...,fn]. We then select
nouns that have a frequency larger than a prede-
fined threshold and place them into a hard prompt.
Heuristic threshold : Since frequency is dis-
crete, we can manually find the best threshold by
conducting experiments with every possible thresh-
old. This allows us to determine the global optimal
threshold.
Adaptive threshold : We can use a heuristic
threshold, but these thresholds are often unsuitable
for di fferent environments, and performing exten-
sive experiments incurs unnecessary costs. Instead,
we can estimate the common distribution of noun
frequencies as certain probability distributions. We
can assume frequencies follow N(µF,σ2
F).
τadap=µF+σF. (6)
Any nouns with a frequency larger than τadap,
which places them in the upper 15 %, can be con-
sidered outliers. Using this adaptive threshold, we
can implement a flexible threshold that fits various
settings. However, it does not guarantee global
optima, leading to a trade-o ffrelationship between
heuristic thresholds and adaptive thresholds.

et al., 2023) and SynTIC (Liu et al., 2023) utilize
text-to-image generation models like Stable Di ffu-
sion (Rombach et al., 2022) to close the gap.
4.3 In-domain Captioning
We benchmark our IFCap on in-domain settings
in Table 1 including COCO and Flickr30k. We
compare our methods with previous state-of-the-art
in text-only image captioning. Our IFCap domi-
nates every metric in the COCO dataset compared
to models that utilize larger models (Gu et al.,
2022; Wang et al., 2023) and have complex train-Design ChoicePre-ϵPost-ϵRetrievalCOCO

in Flickr30k, IFCap shows decent performance in
BLEU@4 and METEOR and achieves the best
scores in CIDEr and SPICE.
4.4 Cross-domain Captioning
We validate IFCap ’s transfer ability through diverse
domains, including the NoCaps validation set and
cross-domain from COCO →Flickr30k and vice
versa. In NoCaps, we use the same model trained
in the COCO domain to test how the model recog-
nizes unseen objects during training. In the NoCaps
validation split, our IFCap performs the best in ev-
ery metric and every domain compared to previous
state-of-the-art text-only image captioning models
(Li et al., 2023; Nukrai et al., 2022; Fei et al., 2023).
Also, in cross-domain settings between COCO and
Flickr30k, IFCap wins state-of-the-art in most met-
rics and the second best in some metrics.
4.5 Video Captioning
In video captioning, we train our model in the same
manner as previous experiments. First, we perform
Image-like Retrieval on the corpus from each video
captioning dataset MSVD (Wu et al., 2017) and
MSR-VTT (Xu et al., 2016). For inference time,
we sample 5 images from input video and calcu-
late the average of their CLIP image features. We
also retrieve 5 sentences from each sampled im-
age, 25 in total, and also calculate the average of
CLIP text features per image. Most of the met-Transformer Cross-Attention COCO

rics in both datasets, IFCap , fulfills state-of-the-art
performance, except METEOR.
4.6 Ablation Study
We conduct extensive experiments to identify
the impact of each key component in IFCap ,
Image-like Retrieval ( ILR), Fusion Module( FM),
and Frequency-based Entity Filtering( EF). Also,
for each component, we search the best hyper-
parameter in the COCO test split with an in-domain
setting.
Key Components: We check the strength of
each component by detaching from our best model,
which consists of all 3 components Table 5. First,
removing FM, we simply concatenate the input text
feature and retrieved features after applying dimen-
sion mapping layers fl1andfl2and passing it to the
caption decoder. Removing EFis simply applying
entity extraction via CLIP classifier like (Fei et al.,
2023) does. Demounting ILR makes inaccessi-
ble to retrieval features solely using input features;
hence FMcan’t exist without ILR. Adding more
components into the baseline, we can explicitly
notice performance improvement. So, using all
three key components constitutes a state-of-the-art
model, which is IFCap . Note that IFCap has 2 vari-
ants, IFCap andIFCap⋆, with EFand without EF
respectively. To see a full comparison of various

Image-like Retrieval: It is crucial to identify
adequate timing for injecting noise into text fea-
tures for successful text-to-text retrieval that imi-
tates image-to-text retrieval. We can split injecting
timing into Pre- ϵand Post-ϵ. We find that our set-
ting which injects noise before performing retrieval
is the best among all possible combinations. We
can verify this in Table 6. The first column of the
table indicates how the model performs retrieval,
just for easy understanding of noise injection in
retrieval.
Fusion Module: We utilize a cross-attention
layer and transformer layer for mapping the net-
work. In Table 8, we try multiple combinations
of the number of each layer. The more layers we
use, the more performance gain we can get until
the number of transformer layers is 4. The per-
formance gain is also observed when we use 8
transformer layers but it is so slight. Increasing
the number of cross-attention layers is e ffective
when the transformer layer is small, but the ten-
dency does not last while the transformer layer
grows. We conclude using 8 transformer layers and0.850.900.951.001.05

a single cross-attention layer shows the best perfor-
mance. For a fair comparison, we detach the EF
module. Also, the number of retrieved captions is
crucial. We conduct ablation studies to find optimal
k, which can be found in Table 7.
Frequency-based Entity Filtering: We need to
choose 1) how many retrieved sentences l, to use
and 2) the threshold τ, for filtering nouns for EF
to extract accurate and diverse entities. The former
can be found in Table 9, note that in di fferent do-
mains, optimal lmay vary. For the COCO domain,
using las 9 shows the best performance, while 7 is
the best in Flickr30k.
We find the best threshold setting in a heuristic
and adaptive way. In the former case Table 10, we
setτranging from 1 to 8, which is the minimum
and maximum value of the given setting. Above
8, performance freeze due to none of the entities
being retrieved. In the COCO test, we use l=9
andl=7in the Flickr30k test split. We notice that
each domain has di fferent optimal τ, COCO at 5
and Flickr30k at 3 for the CIDEr score. In contrast
to the heuristic way, we can assume such distribu-
tion exists from frequencies F. We try Gaussian
distribution and Log-normal distribution with µ,
µ+σ, andµ+2σ, capturing upper 50%, 15.8%,
and 2.2% based on the frequency of entity. In Ta-
ble 11, we observe τadap=µ+σalmost reproduces
the performance of global optimal in the heuristic
threshold. If ground truth does not exist or com-
puting resource is limited, the adaptive threshold
becomes attractive.5 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a zero-shot caption-
ing method, IFCap , through text-only training.
IFCap performs Image-like Retrieval to address
the gap between image-to-text retrieval and text-
to-text retrieval, Fusion Module for interaction be-
tween existing and additional representations, and
Frequency-based Entity Filtering during inference
time to extract frequently occurring entities from
the retrieved sentences. Our method can be eas-
ily applied to various tasks and provides valuable
guidance for retrieval-based methods in a text-only
setting. It o ffers clear and precise information
to LLMs without relying on a limited vocabulary.
The simplicity and robustness of IFCap are demon-
strated through state-of-the-art performance across
various datasets in image and video captioning.
The future direction of our method includes the
extension of our method on more complex datasets,
such as region-based captioning (Kim et al., 2019a,
2021) or visual question answering (Cho et al.,
2023a,b), which su ffer from data issues.
6 Limitations
We demonstrate that IFCap exhibits superior perfor-
mance across various image captioning and video
captioning datasets compared to other zero-shot
image captioning models with text-only training.
However, the optimal value of ϵrfor Image-like
Retrieval currently requires a heuristic approach
to determine. We leave the task of finding a more
convenient method for determining the optimal ϵr
as future work to further improve image captioning
models with text-only training.

retrieval (Wang et al., 2023). Based on Fig. 5, we
perform ILR withϵr=0.04in the training time
