Abstract
Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been rapidly
developed and widely used in various fields, but the (poten-
tial) stereotypical bias in the model is largely unexplored. In
this study, we present a pioneering measurement framework,
ModSCAN , toSCAN the stereotypical bias within LVLMs from
both vision and language Modalities. ModSCAN examines
stereotypical biases with respect to two typical stereotypical
attributes (gender and race) across three kinds of scenarios:
occupations, descriptors, and persona traits. Our findings
suggest that 1) the currently popular LVLMs show significant
stereotype biases, with CogVLM emerging as the most biased
model; 2) these stereotypical biases may stem from the inher-
ent biases in the training dataset and pre-trained models; 3) the
utilization of specific prompt prefixes (from both vision and
language modalities) performs well in reducing stereotypical
biases. We believe our work can serve as the foundation for
understanding and addressing stereotypical bias in LVLMs.

1 Introduction
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown im-
pressive comprehension and reasoning capabilities, as well as
the ability to generate output that conforms to human instruc-
tions, such as those in the GPT [7, 28] and LLaMA [40] fami-
lies. Based on this ability, many works, such as GPT-4V [28],
LLaV A-v1.5 [20], and MiniGPT-v2 [9], have introduced vi-
sual understanding to LLMs. By adding a vision encoder and
then fine-tuning with multi-modal instruction-following data,
these previous works have demonstrated that large vision-
language models (LVLMs) are capable of following human
instruction to complete both textual and visual tasks, such as
image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
retrieval [1, 9, 20, 21, 44, 51].
However, increasing research suggests that models can
capture real-world distributional bias during training or even
exacerbate the bias during inference. Vision encoders like
CLIP have been shown to associate specific social groups
with certain attributes [3, 6, 8, 10, 19, 49]. For example, in

NoYesFigure 1: Potential scenarios that LVLMs generate information
containing stereotypical bias. Note that the above stereotypical
judgments are based on the biased output of the LLaV A-v1.5
model on the occupation “nurses” and the descriptor “person
stealing,” which do not represent the authors’ views.
CLIP’s feature space, female images are closer to the word
“family” and farther from the word “career” whereas male
images are placed at a similar distance from both [6]. This
association can perpetuate gender stereotypes and reinforce
societal biases. Stereotypical bias also exists in LLMs [13,34].
Recent research has demonstrated that LLMs tend to learn and
internalize societal prejudices present in the training data. As
a result, they may generate biased or discriminatory language
that reflects and amplifies existing stereotypes.
With the rise of LVLMs, which combine both vision en-
coders and LLMs, the degree to which these models inherit
and amplify stereotypical biases remains unexplored. Given
the powerful multi-tasking capabilities of LVLMs and their
application in critical tasks, the potential biases from VLMs
could lead to more severe consequences. As depicted in Fig-
ure 1, in career planning, the biased LVLMs could influence
decisions related to job opportunities, promotions, and profes-
sional trajectories, perpetuating existing stereotypes and hin-
dering diversity and inclusivity efforts. Similarly, in criminal
judgment, they might also exacerbate disparities in sentencing,
exacerbate racial or socioeconomic biases, and compromise
the fairness and integrity of the legal system. Such outcomes
underscore the importance of understanding and mitigating
biases in LVLMs to ensure equitable outcomes across real-
world applications.

Our Contributions. In this work, we take the first step
towards studying stereotypical bias within LVLMs. We for-
mulate three research questions: (RQ1) How prevalent is
stereotypical bias in LVLMs, and how does it vary across
different LVLMs? (RQ2) What are the underlying reasons for
social bias in LVLMs? (RQ3) How to mitigate stereotypical
bias within LVLMs? Are there any differences in addressing
this bias across vision and language modalities?
To address these research questions, we introduce a novel
measurement framework, ModSCAN , toSCAN the stereotypi-
cal bias within LVLMs from different Modalities, as shown
in Figure 2. We perform ModSCAN on three popular open-
source LVLMs, namely LLaV A [20, 21], MiniGPT-4 [9, 51],
and CogVLM [44]. We study the stereotypical bias by evalu-
ating their vision and language modalities with two attributes
(gender and race) across three scenarios (occupation, descrip-
tor, and persona). Through extensive experiments, we have
three main findings.
•LVLMs exhibit varying degrees of stereotypical bias.
Notably, LLaV A-v1.5 and CogVLM show the most sig-
nificant biases, with bias scores being 7.21% and 16.47%
higher than those of MiniGPT-v2, respectively ( RQ1 ).
•Besides the bias from pre-trained vision encoders and
language models, we identify another factor: biased
datasets also contribute to biased LVLMs ( RQ2 ). For
example, certain occupations (e.g., nursing) are more fre-
quently associated with specific genders (e.g., females).
•The stereotypical bias in LVLMs could be mitigated by
using prompt prefix mechanisms from either the lan-
guage or vision input. In particular, the language in-
put prefix more effectively addresses the bias of vision
modality tasks and vice versa.
2 Preliminary
In this study, we explore stereotypical bias by focusing on
two key aspects: stereotypical attributes and stereotypical sce-
narios. First, we introduce the definition of stereotypical bias.
We then introduce the evaluated stereotypical scenarios and
attributes. Besides, we present related works in Appendix A.

typical bias [4, 19, 24], which is “ a systematic asymmetry inOccupation

language choice that reflects the prejudices or stereotypes of
a social group, such as gender, race, religion, or profession. ”
For example, a language model may associate certain occu-
pations or descriptors (e.g., person stealing) with a specific
gender or race (e.g., Black), even there is no logical or factual
basis for doing so [2, 3, 18, 19, 37, 39].
Stereotypical Attribute. The stereotypical attribute refers to
a characteristic of an individual that has the potential to evoke
preconceived notions or generalizations in a given situation.
Following previous research [3, 17, 19, 42], our study focuses
on two commonly observed attributes: gender and race. We
consider two primary gender categories, male and female, and
four major racial categories, White, Black, Asian, and Indian.
The categorization of gender and race is determined by the
dataset used and could be extended based on more detailed
datasets. These categories reflect broad classifications often
used for demographic purposes but should not be seen as
exhaustive or definitive representations of human diversity.
Stereotypical Scenario. As shown in Table 1, we consider
three kinds of real-world scenarios, i.e., occupations, descrip-
tors, and persona traits. Occupations and descriptors have
been revealed by previous works that are likely to be associ-
ated with stereotypes related to gender and race [3, 50]. For
example, text-to-image models tend to associate faces with
dark skin and stereotypically Black features with descriptions
such as “person stealing” [3]. Beyond the two typical scenar-
ios, we further extend our evaluation to persona traits, since
they represent the social identity that an individual projects to
create a specific impression on others. [10] shows that humans
and LLMs tend to employ different stereotypical persona traits
when generating personas of different social groups, reflect-
ing the feasibility of personas as a scenario for analyzing the
impact of stereotypes in LVLMs. We adopt ten occupations
and ten descriptors from [3]. Regarding persona traits, we
include six hobby traits (e.g., Art Lover) and four lifestyle
traits (e.g., Slob) sourced from the game “The Sims,”1as well
as four wealth traits (e.g., Luxury Villa) inspired by [3]. The
detailed definitions of these 14 persona traits are summarized

in Table 2. In general, given that three scenarios are suscepti-
ble to stereotypical bias in real-world contexts, such bias may
also appear in content produced by LVLMs.
3ModSCAN
The critical design of LVLMs lies in their incorporation of
both the vision modality and language modality. In contrast to
previous studies that have examined only one modality, we in-
troduce a novel framework ModSCAN , to explore the behavioral
patterns of LVLMs regarding stereotypical bias from both
two modalities. Figure 2 provides an overview of ModSCAN .
Specifically, the visual modality examines the behavior of
the LVLM when presented with different images based on
its understanding of given textual prompts. The language
modality examines the LVLM’s behavior when exposed to
different demographic text prompts and is entirely dependent
on its ability to understand a given image.
3.1 Vision Modality
To investigate the stereotypical bias from vision modality,
given a text prompt depicting a specific scenario (one of oc-
cupation, descriptor, or persona trait), we elicit the model’sresponse by presenting them with images containing pairs
of individual faces belonging to different social groups. Fig-
ure 3a provides an illustration for querying the LVLMs to
choose the human face for a given occupation. Here, individ-
ual faces are paired with different genders (male vs. female)
or different races (e.g., Black vs. White). In this setting, face
information for different social groups in terms of gender and
race is encoded by a vision encoder, which can reflect the
stereotypical biases present in the vision modality of LVLMs.
Next, we detail how to construct LVLM’s inputs and how to
parse its responses.
Input Construction. In constructing vision inputs for
gender-related selection, we pair two facial images with the
same age and race but differing genders, thereby reflecting
gender-related stereotypical bias from the model’s choices.
Similarly, for race-related selection, we pair two facial images
with the same age and gender but differing races to reflect
race-related stereotypical bias.
Regarding the text prompt, inspired by the formulation
used in [9], we formulate our text prompt as “Tell me the spa-
tial location of the [ATTRIBUTE ].” The term [ATTRIBUTE ]
can refer to pronouns denoting occupations, descriptors, and
persona traits listed in Table 1.

scenarios (occupation, descriptor, and persona) and two attributes (gender and race).
Output Parsing. As depicted in Figure 3a, Figure 3c,
and Figure 3b, due to different strategies, the LVLMs have a
variety of output formats, including direct answers (LLaV A-
v1.5) and bounding boxes (MiniGPT-v2 and CogVLM). Here,
we adopt different methods to process these different output
formats. Regarding LLaV A-v1.5, we employ Regular Expres-
sion (RE)2to extract spatial position words, i.e., “left” or
“right,” from the response. For MiniGPT-v2 and CogVLM,
each set of four numbers in their responses denotes a bound-
ing box that we could get “left” or “right.” Specifically,
MiniGPT-v2 outputs bounding box coordinates in the format:
<Xle ft><Ytop><Xright><Ybottom>, where each number,
ranging from 0 to 100, delineates a horizontal or vertical line
on the plane, with four numbers defining a rectangular area.
Similarly, CogVLM also employs a bounding box format,
with each number ranging from 0 to 1000. To determine the
orientation of the bounding box (left or right), we filter out
boxes whose width (height) is less than 25% (50%) of the
total width, as they may not accurately locate the face. Among
the remaining boxes, those situated within the 60% area on
the left (right) side are deemed to represent the left (right)
position, while others are considered inaccurate. We illustrate
examples of valid (i.e., left or right) and invalid (i.e., N/A)
parsed results in Figure 4.
3.2 Language Modality
We now present how to investigate the stereotypical bias of
LVLMs in their language modality. In this modality, we focus
only on persona traits. We exclude occupations and descrip-
tors because their corresponding images often contain explicit
gender or race information. For instance, occupations like
“firefighter” and “nurse” and descriptors like “attractive” and
“emotional” directly describe individuals, and their images in-
herently convey race or gender details. Consequently, LVLM
responses to these images cannot be considered socially bi-
ased, as the model is simply making an appropriate choice
based on the image.
In contrast, persona traits allow us to obtain images (mostly

newly generated) strongly related to the trait without convey-
ing any gender or race information. In this case, the model’s
response to gender or race prompts can reveal inherent social
biases within the LVLMs. Therefore, we conduct our study on
the stereotypical scenario of persona traits only. Specifically,
given an image depicting a persona trait, we prompt LVLM
with a text containing demographic word choices representing
different social groups. Figure 3d illustrates this process. We
then explain how to construct persona trait inputs to evaluate
the stereotypical bias in LVLMs’ language modality and how
to analyze their responses.
Input Construction. The persona traits cover individuals’
preferences (hobbies), living habits (lifestyle), and posses-
sions (wealth). To obtain their associated visual images, we
utilize the text-to-image model Stable Diffusion (SD) [33]
to generate images corresponding to each trait. For instance,
we prompt the SD with “A piece of art painting” to generate
images for the trait “art lover.” All the prompts for SD are
constructed based on each persona trait’s definition (see Ta-
ble 2). We illustrate some generated images for persona traits

in Figure 5.
For the text prompts for LVLMs, each prompt is tailored
for a specific persona trait, allowing the models to select from
terms representing different social groups. As shown in Fig-
ure 3d, when presenting an image related to the trait “art
lover,” we prompt the model with “The person who paints
this painting is [SOCIAL TERMS ].” Here, [SOCIAL TERMS ]
represents a random order of social group terms. For gen-
der,[SOCIAL TERMS ]could be Shuffle(male, female), with
the function Shuffle( ·) used to randomize the order of social
group terms. Similarly, for race, [SOCIAL TERMS ]could be
Shuffle(White, Black, Asian, Indian). A summary of the text
prompts for all persona traits and stereotypical attributes is
provided in Table 3.
Output Parsing. Figure 3d illustrates that LVLMs either
provide a direct response corresponding to the chosen term
for a particular social group or complete the input sentence.
For the completed input sentence, we employ the Regular
Expression to extract the generated word(s) related to social
groups. Then, we classify these word(s) into specific gender or
race categories accordingly. Specifically, when the attribute is
gender, we adopt word lists (Table 10) from previous work [5,
19] to differentiate between genders. When the attribute is
race, we simply match the words in {‘a White,’ ‘a Black,’ ‘an
Asian,’ and ‘an Indian’} to determine the social term of the
words. We show some examples of the outputs of our persona-
related task in Table 11. Responses that do not pertain to any
specific gender or race are categorized as N/A.
4 Experimental Setup
Evaluated Models. We adopt three popular open-
source LVLMs: LLaV A-v1.5 [20], MiniGPT-v2 [9], andCogVLM [44]. For the pre-trained LLMs, LLaV A-v1.5 and
CogVLM utilize Vicuna (7B) [22], while MiniGPT-v2 em-
ploys LLaMA2-chat (7B) [40]. Additionally, the vision en-
coders utilized for these models include CLIP-ViT-L [31] for
LLaV A-v1.5, EV A [12] for MiniGPT-v2, and EV A-CLIP [38]
for CogVLM.
Datasets. We utilize UTKFace [48] and images generated
by SD-v2.1 [33] to measure stereotypical biases in the vision
and language modalities, respectively.
Specifically, we utilize the UTKFace dataset [48] to mea-
sure stereotypical biases in the vision modality. This dataset
offers several advantages. First, each image comes with labels
indicating gender, race, and age, facilitating the creation of
images featuring diverse social groups. Second, all images
are cropped to focus solely on facial information, minimizing
contextual interference. For instance, if a person is wearing
a fireman’s outfit, the model might determine the person’s
occupation based on information other than race and gender,
such as clothing. Each data sample xin UTKFace is asso-
ciated with three discrete labels: age ( y1) ranging from 0 to
116, gender ( y2) classified as either male or female, and race
(y3) categorized as White, Black, Asian, Indian, or others. To
ensure data integrity, we filter out samples below the general
legal working age (under 18) and those beyond the traditional
retirement age (over 65) [26, 45]. Due to dataset incomplete-
ness, for gender labels, we consider binary gender (i.e., male
and female), and we retain samples with race labels limited
to White, Black, Asian, and Indian for evaluation purposes.
For gender (race) analysis, we group samples by age and
race (gender), randomly selecting up to 20 pairs of pictures
with different genders and horizontally splicing them together
in pairs (with randomized left and right positions). Conse-

black horizontal lines represent the percentage of each occupation from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2023 data [25]. We introduce
statistics to test whether models exacerbate real-world bias.
quently, we obtain 2,604 pairs for gender-related evaluation
and 7,378 pairs for race-related evaluation.
To quantify stereotypical biases in the language modality,
we employ SD-v2.1 [33] to generate 400 images randomly
for each persona trait, where the detailed description for each
trait and the corresponding SD prompt are listed in Table 2.
Subsequently, to make the model’s judgment based entirely
on the visual context related to persona traits, rather than the
information about the humans that may exist in the vision in-
put, we apply YOLOv8x [41] to identify and filter out images
containing person(s). For each persona trait, we randomly
select 200 images for our analysis. In total, we utilize 2,800
images corresponding to the 14 persona traits.5 Experimental Results
In this section, we conduct a series of experiments to study
the bias in current LVLMs, i.e., to answer RQ1 .
5.1 Evaluation on Vision Modality
We now present the stereotypical biases associated with the
vision modality. Our focus is on two social attributes: gender
and race, across three potentially biased scenarios: occupation,
descriptor, and persona trait. Specifically, when evaluating the
gender-related stereotypical bias among different occupations,
we introduce real-world gender distribution data from the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2023 data [25]. We aim to
analyze whether the current LVLMs capture, inherit, or even
amplify gender imbalances (stereotypes) by comparing them
6with real-world statistical data.
Stereotypical Bias of Gender. Figure 6 depicts the gender
distribution for various occupations. Results of descriptors
and persona traits are presented in Figure 12 and Figure 13.
We notice that, for most occupations, the gender percentage
deviates from 0.5, indicating that LVLMs demonstrate gender
stereotypes in their perceptions of occupations. Notably, for
approximately 90% of the 10 analyzed occupations (except
therapist), model outputs align with real-world gender biases,
indicating LVLMs’ ability to reflect stereotypical biases to
some extent. Moreover, for certain occupations (e.g., nurse),
the degree of stereotypical bias in model response exceeds
actual statistics, potentially exacerbating stereotypes. Then,
for descriptors and persona traits, we also observe that most
of them showed asymmetric gender distribution. Given the
widespread use of these models, this could significantly per-
petuate stereotypical biases associating gender and specific
scenarios in reality.
Furthermore, to show how similar the outputs of these
LVLMs are, we calculate the similarity of the outputs of each
model. The similarity is measured by the percentage of iden-
tical parsed outputs from each of the two models. As shown
in Table 4a, MiniGPT-v2 and CogVLM have the highest
similarity. The reason may be that both have visual ground-
ing capabilities (i.e., bounding boxes aforementioned), while
LLaV A-v1.5 does not [9, 20, 44].
Stereotypical Bias of Race. To measure race-related bias
through face selection, we examine all possible combina-
tions of two faces belonging to different social groups, such
as White and Black, Asian and White, etc. We present the
results in Figure 7. Here, we present the results for the fire-
fighter occupation on three LVLMs. More results can be
found in Appendix B. Notably, when comparing any two
races, we observe a clear bias toward occupations, descrip-
tors, and persona traits. For instance, in Figure 7a, a value
of 0.8 at (Black ,Asian)indicates that LLaV A-v1.5 is 80%
likely to assign Black individuals as firefighters compared to
Asians. This finding highlights the significant bias in LVLMs’
decision-making processes, such as recruitment, posing a
substantial risk to the interests of various racial groups.
Furthermore, regarding the similarity of model outputs (re-
ported in Table 4a), LLaV A-v1.5 and CogVLM exhibit higher
similarity, likely due to their shared LLM architecture. For
both gender and race evaluations, LLaV A-v1.5 and MiniGPT-
v2 demonstrate the lowest similarity, possibly stemming from
inconsistencies in their LLMs and visual grounding capabili-
ties.
5.2 Evaluation on Language Modality
We now present the evaluation results of language modality.
Note that we exclusively focus on one scenario, i.e., persona
trait. We find that, in language modality, current LVLMs
also exhibit severe stereotypical bias when choosing different
social groups. For instance, when choosing the face corre-
sponding to the persona trait “loves outdoors,” LLaV A-v1.5
and CogVLM always (100%) choose the male face.
Stereotypical Bias of Gender. As depicted in Figure 8, we
observe relatively symmetrical gender responses under some

conditions (e.g., LLaV A-v1.5 on Neat, CogVLM on Freegan),
but significant differences (27.79%, 23.89%, and 49.00% on
average for LLaV A-v1.5, MiniGPT-v2, and CogVLM) in gen-
der percentages prevail in most cases. Despite some models
(especially MiniGPT-v2) generating a considerable number
of N/A responses, they still demonstrate strong stereotypes in
their non-N/A responses, as evidenced by filtering out N/A
responses. Moreover, the similarity between each model’s
outputs is detailed in Table 4b. Notably, LLaV A-v1.5 and
CogVLM exhibit high similarity in gender due to their identi-
cal LLM architecture and the high N/A rate of MiniGPT-v2.
Besides, we notice that in Figure 8, all LVLMs have a
preference for the gender male, even on some contradictory
persona traits (e.g., luxury car and dilapidated car). To un-
derstand whether LVLMs have a default skew towards the
gender male rather than stereotypical bias, we conduct an
experiment in which, for each persona trait in the language
modality tasks, a blank white image is input and the given
question is asked. Table 5 shows the difference in the per-
centage of male and female selected in the model output (i.e.,
male percentage - female percentage, positive values indicate
a preference for male and vice versa) when a blank image or
the original image is input. The data for inputting the orig-
inal image is obtained from Figure 8. We notice that when
inputting blank images, the answers generated by MiniGPT-
v2 and CogVLM do not have obvious gender preferences in
most persona traits, while the answers of LLaV A-v1.5 contain
certain gender preferences (but not as significant as when
inputting original images). When we use 10% as a threshold,
for (MiniGPT-v2, CogVLM, LLaV A-v1.5), when inputting
blank images, only (2, 1, 4) person traits have a difference
greater than the threshold, while this number reaches (7, 11,
7) when inputting original images. Formally, as shown in the
last row of Table 5, when inputting blank images, the bias

scores of LVLMs are 0.0182, 0.0529, and 0.0914, respectively.
When inputting original images, their bias scores all increase
to 0.1252, 0.2327, and 0.1390, which indicates that 1) thereare some default skews in pre-trained models that contribute
to the stereotypical bias of LVLMs to a certain extent and
2) introducing vision context further promotes the model’s
biased generation. For instance, when a blank image is input,
LLaV A-v1.5 has an 81% probability of selecting Male for
“loves outdoors,” and this probability reaches 100% when a
valid image related to “loves outdoors” is input.
Stereotypical Bias of Race. In contrast to gender, Figure 11
shows that all persona traits exhibit significant asymmetry
between races. For example, based on CogVLM’s outputs,
there’s a 78% probability that the owner of a luxury car is
White, while a dilapidated car’s owner has a 52.5% probability
of being Black. Similarly, after filtering out N/A responses,
they still exhibit strong stereotypes in non-N N/A responses.
Among the most persona traits, LLaV A-v1.5 and MiniGPT-v2
tend to choose White, while CogVLM leans towards selecting
Black individuals, resulting in higher similarity between the
former two (see Table 4b). These findings differ from those
observed in occupations and descriptions, suggesting that the
social bias generated by LVLMs depends on the type of task.
5.3 Stereotypical Bias Score
To further quantify the extent of stereotypical bias in different
LVLMs, we introduce a new metric, namely bias score . First,
given stereotypical attribute A, we define the list of targeted
social groups as below:
LA={{male ,female}, i f A=gender ,
{White ,Black ,Asian ,Indian}, i f A=race .(1)
For each stereotypical scenario S, there exists a correspond-
ing list of instances denoted as LS(e.g., 10 occupations, 10
descriptors, and 14 traits). To simplify notation, we represent
thek-th element in LAandLSasLA,kandLS,k, respectively.
Following the definition of stereotypical association for lan-
guage models [19], we formulate our bias score for LVLMs
as below:

Here,∥⋅∥denotes the computation of the number of el-

respectively. Meanwhile, pi,jsignifies the probability of se-
lecting social group LA,ifor scenario instance LS,j. The bias
score Sbias, ranging from 0 to 0.5, quantifies the asymmetry
in LVLMs’ selection of different social groups, with higher
scores indicating greater bias.
The above bias score Sbiasis calculated based on the entire
outputs of LVLMs, including N/A responses, which are re-
garded as non-biased answers in our calculation. However, in
real-world cases, users may only accept available (non-N/A)
answers. Therefore, we further consider the N/A filtered bias
score that removes N/A responses before computing Sbias.
Results. We report the bias score of each LVLM for both
vision and language modalities in Table 6. First, for vi-
sion modality, CogVLM exhibits the strongest stereotypes ingender-related choices, followed by MiniGPT-v2. Regarding
race-related choices, both LLaV A-v1.5 and CogVLM demon-
strate stronger stereotypical bias compared to MiniGPT-v2.
Overall, CogVLM has the most stereotypical bias in vision
modality. Similarly, in language modality, CogVLM exhibits
the highest bias scores towards race and gender, consistent
with the results on vision modality. However, the high N/A
rate of MiniGPT-v2 suggests that its Sbiaswould significantly
increase (by 12.79%) if N/A responses are filtered out, indi-
cating the persistence of serious stereotypes in the LVLM.
Additionally, we introduce a new model, Ensemble , which
represents a consensus (intersection) of the responses from
all three models. For instance, when querying gender-related
facial choices, if all three models select the same option, it
indicates a consensus Interestingly, consensus among these
models leads to more extreme social deviance, suggesting
a persistent presence of stereotypical biases across different
9models for both vision and language modalities.
Overall, the average Sbiasfor each LVLM shows that
LLaV A-v1.5 and CogVLM have higher (7.21% and 16.47%
respectively) bias scores than MiniGPT-v2, showing that their
model outputs contain more significant stereotypical bias
when N/A responses are kept, possibly due to their shared
LLM architecture.
Besides, we explore how role-playing prefixes affect the
outputs of LVLMs and find specific roles could exacerbate
(or mitigate) the stereotypical bias. For instance, by adding a
prompt prefix “Act as a racist,” the stereotypical bias score of
MiniGPT-v2 could be improved in most cases by up to 0.0669
on language modality tasks. For more details, please refer
to Appendix C.
Takeaways for RQ1. Current LVLMs exhibit signifi-
cant stereotypical biases across multiple scenarios. No-
tably, LLaVA-v1.5 and CogVLM stand out as the most biased
LVLMs. Furthermore, different role-playing interventions
yield diverse effects on stereotypical bias.
6 Why LVLMs Are Stereotypically Biased?
LVLMs consist of two main components: a pre-trained vision
encoder and a LLM. Previous work [3,6,10,19,49] have high-
lighted social biases in both the vision encoders and LLMs.
For instance, [6] shows that the ViT models tend to associate
females more closely with the word “family” rather than “ca-
reer,” whereas males show comparable association with both
terms. Also, [10] finds that GPT-4 uses different stereotypical
words when describing different social groups. In addition,
through our experimental results in Table 5, we observe that,
in language modality, when feeding the blank white image
to LVLMs, though the image does not contain any persona-
related information, for most persona traits, CogVLM and
LLaV A-v1.5 still show a slight preference for specific gen-
ders (+4.00% and -6.00%). This indicates that pre-trained
language models have a stereotypical bias (or default skew)
when selecting genders. This default skew could contribute
to the stereotypical bias in the answers generated by LVLMs
when inputting non-blank original images. For specific per-
sona traits, we even observe a more severe default skew. For
instance, when a blank image is input, LLaV A-v1.5 has an
81% probability of selecting male for “loves outdoors,” and
this probability reaches 100% when a valid image related to
“loves outdoors” is input. Overall, we show that 1) there are
some default skews in pre-trained models that contribute to
the stereotypical bias of LVLMs to a certain extent and 2)
introducing non-blank vision contexts further promotes the
model’s biased generation.
Besides the above factors, we investigate another potential
source: the dataset used to train LVLMs. Previous work has
shown that in-the-wild image(video)-text data could contain
hateful tendencies against certain specific gender groups or
occupations [16]. In particular, we perform a case study
on LLaV A-v1.5 and its training dataset LCS-558K [20, 21],
which contains about 558K image-text pairs. Specifically, we
focus on gender bias in occupations and descriptors. First,
we use the words in Table 10 to count the occurrences of
gender-specific terms in the dataset’s text. We find that thedataset contains 27,837 instances of words associated with
males and 30,958 instances of words associated with females,
suggesting subtle gender differences. Furthermore, we isolate
each occupation and count the occurrences of gender-specific
terms in its prompt. We then calculate bias scores for each
gender term (see Table 7). The findings illustrate stereotypical
biases present in both the dataset and the model outputs. For
instance, occupations like nurse and housekeeper, as well as
descriptors such as attractive and clean, exhibit a bias favoring
females in both the dataset and the model’s responses.
Takeaways for RQ2. In addition to the factors of stereotyped
pre-trained models utilized in Language Models (LVLMs), the
training dataset itself plays a significant role in contributing
to their stereotypical biases. The composition of the training
data greatly influences the level of stereotypical biases within
LVLMs.
7 Mitigation
Language-Based. To alleviate toxic content in LLMs, many
methods can be used, such as adding prompt prefixes and
suffixes, filtering input and output information, fine-tuning the
model with human feedback, etc [15, 29, 36, 46]. In this work,
we mainly focus on evaluating the effectiveness of adding
different prompt prefixes to reduce the stereotypical bias of
LVLMs (which minimally affects LVLMs’ performance on
other tasks) and leave the evaluation of other methods as
future work. We consider two prompt prefix mechanisms,
namely self-reminder (SR) [46] and Debiasing [36], to reduce
stereotypical bias. For SR [46], we add an instruction in front
of our original text prompt as “ You should be a responsible
model and should not generate harmful or misleading content!
Please answer the following user query in a responsible way. ”
For debiasing [36], we also add an instruction in front of
our original text prompt as “ We should treat people from dif-
ferent socioeconomic statuses, sexual orientations, religions,
races, physical appearances, nationalities, gender identities,
disabilities, and ages equally. When we do not have sufficient
information, we should choose the unknown option, rather
than making assumptions based on our stereotypes. ”
We find that both mechanisms could reduce stereotypical
bias in most cases, with Debiasing performing better. For in-
stance, on CogVLM, the SR and Debiasing could reduce the
bias score for gender in occupations by 0.3274 and 0.3471, re-
spectively. The effectiveness of Debiasing may stem from its
explicit emphasis on treating certain social attributes equally
and avoiding selection based on stereotypes. However, after
filtering N/A answers and calculating the bias score again,
we observe an increase in the bias score. Table 8 report the
performance (reduction of bias score) of two mitigations on
considered three LVLMs. We note that both mechanisms re-
duce stereotypical bias in most cases, with Debiasing perform-
ing better. Specifically, SR can effectively reduce stereotypes
in the model output of LLaV A-v1.5 and CogVLM, but not
in MiniGPT-v2, and debasing is more effective than SR in
both LVLMs. In addition, for some tricky situations, such as
the gender-related persona task in language modality for the
LLaV A-v1.5 model, neither SR nor Debiasing can effectively
reduce the bias score. Because no mitigation can perfectly re-

duce the bias score to 0 (that is, produce asymmetric answers
or all N/A answers), users can still obtain model knowledge
from non-N/A answers. Considering the N/A filtered bias
score, it indicates that the reduction in stereotypical bias relies
heavily on the model not making exact answers, rather than
generating symmetric answers, and there are even increased
stereotypes in non-N/A answers. For instance, on CogVLM,
though Debiasing reduces the bias score for race in occupa-
tions by 0.1158, its N/A filtered bias score even increases by
0.0807. This reinforces the fact that perfectly removing bias
in LVLMs is difficult, while it is easier to have a model reject
answers than to have a model produce symmetric answers.
Vision-Based. Furthermore, previous work [14] shows that
LVLMs have the ability for OCR and could even execute the
instructions in the input image. Hence, we conduct a case
study of mitigating stereotypical bias by concatenating the
well-performed Debiasing prompt prefix within the original
image input (see Figure 10 for examples). We call this method
VisDebiasing , and report the results in Table 9. For vision
modality, VisDebiasing has little impact on the bias score of
each LVLM. It could only reduce the bias score of LLaV A-
v1.5 to a certain extent, but the performance is not as good as
Debiasing. This may be due to the fact that the vision encoder
focuses on identifying and capturing the face in the image for
generating outputs while ignoring the text in the image. In
contrast, for language modality, VisDebiasing outperforms
Debiasing on MiniGPT-v2 and CogVLM by greatly reducing
the bias score to nearly 0. This is because, in the language
modality task, the vision encoder understands the overall
information of the image (including the original image and
concatenated text) for generation. These findings suggest thatembedding stereotype-reducing information into vision and
language inputs has different effects in different scenarios.
Takeaways for RQ3. Debiasing and VisDebiasing prove
effective in reducing the bias score, with a significant variety
across different modalities; however, the performance experi-
ences a notable degradation when filtering N/A answers.
8 Conclusion
In this work, we propose ModSCAN , a framework to systemat-
ically measure the stereotypical bias in LVLMs across both
vision and language modalities. By evaluating three widely
deployed LVLMs on two attributes, i.e., gender and race, in
three scenarios, i.e., occupation, descriptor, and persona, we
reveal that existing LVLMs hold significant stereotypical bi-
ases against different social groups. We find that popular
LVLMs, particularly LLaV A-v1.5 and CogVLM, exhibit sig-
nificant stereotypical biases. These biases likely originate
from the inherent biases in both the training datasets and the
pre-trained models. We also discover that applying specific
prompt prefixes from both vision and language modalities can
effectively mitigate some of these biases. Our findings under-
score the critical need for the AI community to recognize and
address the stereotypical biases that pervade rapidly evolving
LVLMs. We call on researchers and practitioners to contribute
to the development of unbiased and responsible multi-modal
AI systems, ensuring they serve the diverse needs and values
of global communities.

9 Limitations
Our work has several limitations. First, during our evaluation,
we mainly focus on two major demographic attributes, i.e., bi-
nary gender and four races. This is decided by the evaluation
dataset, which only includes these attributes. We leave explor-
ing stereotypical bias in other attributes (e.g., age [11, 37]) as
future work. Second, it is inevitable that users may prompt
LVLMs in different ways, and these prompts can lead to vary-Attribute Modality Scenario LVLMVisDebiasing

ing degrees of bias in the model outputs. Our predefined input
formats cannot account for all possible user inputs, as our
goal is to investigate the stereotypical biases in LVLMs in
the most natural scenario. We will consider more ways to
prompt LVLMs in the future. Third, while this study assesses
different types of LVLMs, it does not explore how model size
affects bias. We also leave this for future work.
Besides, a potential risk of our work is that it could lead
malicious users to selectively use specific LVLM to generate
content that contains more stereotypes, based on our findings.
10 Ethics Statement
The primary goal of this research is to investigate and miti-
gate the social bias in LVLMs. We rely entirely on publicly
available or generated data, thus our work is not considered
human’s subject research by the Ethical Board Committee.
To further advance related research, we will be committed to
making our code public to ensure its reproducibility.

A Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
An LVLM typically consists of two main components, namely
a pre-trained LLM (e.g., LLaMA [40] or Vicuna [22]) and
a vision encoder (e.g., CLIP-ViT [31] or EV A-CLIP [12]),

along with a small vision-language connector (see Fig-
ure 9). To build an LVLM, it undergoes pre-training on
visual instruction-following data by only updating the vision-
language connector, with the aim of aligning the vision and
language features [21]. Then, visual instruction tuning is per-
formed for a user-specific task (e.g., multi-modal chatbots or
scientific QA), which typically involves freezing the vision
encoder and fine-tuning other components of the LVLM, such
as the vision-language connector or LLM [23, 30]. As vision-
integrated language models, LVLMs bridge the gap between
vision and language, enabling them to process and generate
content that incorporates both modalities seamlessly [47].
Notable examples are proprietary GPT-4v [27], Gemini3
and open-sourced LLaV A [20, 21], MiniGPT-4 [9, 51], and
CogVLM [44]. In this work, we adopt LLaV A, MiniGPT-4,
and CogVLM as the target LVLMs for our study.
Before the emergence of LLMs and LVLMs, there were
other vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, BLIP,
DALL-E [32], and Stable Diffusion (SD) [33]. These VLMs
fall into two categories: those generating text from image
and text inputs (e.g., CLIP and BLIP) and those generating
images from text inputs (e.g., DALL-E and SD). We term
the former “LLM-free VLMs” and the latter “text-to-image
models.” We first emphasize that text-to-image models are
concerned with completely different tasks. LLM-free VLMs,
while sharing some applications with LVLMs, demonstrate
3https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction/ .strengths in tasks such as image captioning, visual grounding,
and optical character recognition. However, they may exhibit
limitations in nuanced context understanding. In contrast,
LVLMs leverage the advanced language capabilities of LLMs,
bridging this gap by addressing complex multi-modal tasks
that demand deep linguistic insights in addition to visual com-
prehension. LVLMs thus represent general-purpose VLMs
with enriched capabilities driven by LLMs.
B More Results for Vision Modality Tasks
For the attribute gender ( A=gender ), Figure 12 and Figure 13
show the results related to each descriptor and persona. For
the attribute race ( A=race), Figure 14, Figure 15, and Fig-
ure 16 show the results for three LVLMs considering 9 oc-
cupations (another one occupation, firefighter, is included
in Figure 7). Figure 17, Figure 18, and Figure 19 show the
results for three LVLMs considering 10 descriptors. Fig-
ure 20, Figure 21, and Figure 22 show the results for three
LVLMs considering 14 persona traits.
Stereotypical Bias of Race. In contrast to gender, Figure 11
shows that all persona traits exhibit significant asymmetry
between races. For example, based on CogVLM’s outputs,
there’s a 78% probability that the owner of a luxury car is
White, while a dilapidated car’s owner has a 52.5% probability
of being Black. Similarly, after filtering out N/A responses,
they still exhibit strong stereotypes in non-N N/A responses.
Among the most persona traits, LLaV A-v1.5 and MiniGPT-v2
tend to choose White, while CogVLM leans towards selecting
Black individuals, resulting in higher similarity between the
former two (see Table 4b). These findings differ from those
observed in occupations and descriptions, suggesting that the
social bias generated by LVLMs depends on the type of task.

The image shows a well-equipped gym with various exercise equipment,
including treadmills, elliptical machines, and free weights. There are also
several benches and chairs scattered throughout the room. The gym is spacious
and has a large mirror on one of the walls, allowing people to monitor their
workout progress. The room is clean and well-maintained, with a blue carpet
covering the floor. There are several people in the gym, some of whom are
using the equipment while others are standing around or sitting on the benches.
The overall atmosphere is lively and inviting, with a sense of community
among the people working out together.

Table 12: The difference in association bias scores on three LVLMs after using different role-playing prompt prefixes. A negative score
indicates a decline and vice versa. we bold the numbers indicating the lowest bias scores and underline the numbers that increase bias
scores.
C Role Play in LVLMs
Inspired by previous work [35, 43] on assigning specific roles
to LLMs, we investigated the effect of role-playing prefixeson stereotypical biases among LVLMs. To explore this, we
prepend the role-playing prefix “Act as [ROLE].” to the origi-

Table 13: The similarity between the original outputs and outputs for the specific role-playing prompt prefixes. For the prompt type
“Sexist/Racist,” we use sexist for gender-related tasks and racist for race-related tasks. We bold the prefix with the highest similarity.
nal text prompt input. We consider roles such as [ROLE]∈[a
sexist, Barack Obama, Donald Trump] for assessing gender
bias, and [ROLE]∈[a racist, Barack Obama, Donald Trump]
for race bias. We report results in Table 12. We can observe
that the Sexist/Racist prefixes tend to exacerbate the stereotyp-
ical bias of MiniGPT-v2 in most cases, although their effect
on other models is limited. Additionally, both LLaV A-v1.5and CogVLM show a slight reduction in bias scores with
the Barack Obama and Donald Trump prefixes. Notably, for
MiniGPT-v2, we find that the role “Barack Obama” yields
less biased results compared to “Donald Trump,” possibly
influenced by how these celebrities are defined within its
LLM.
To further investigate more details about the default role
18each LVLM plays, Table 13 shows the similarity (measured
by the percentage of identical outputs from two models)
between the original outputs and outputs for the several
prompt prefixes. First, in vision modality, we notice that
for occupation-related choices, LLaV A-v1.5 and MiniGPT-v2
play the role closest to a sexist/racist (with similarities up
to 95.39% and 84.36% for MiniGPT-v2 and LLaV A-v1.5,
respectively), showing that models generate a lot of content
consistent with sexism and racism by default. Besides, in the
descriptor and persona-related vision tasks, LLaV A-v1.5 and
MiniGPT-v2’s role is close to Barack Obama. However, for
the language modality, these LVLMs have low similarity with
the roles we evaluate, which indicates that adding role-playing
text prefixes could have a greater impact on language modality
than on vision modality. Also, we notice that, for CogVLM,
after adding the role-playing prefix, its output changes dra-
matically. By inspecting its output, we see that it produces
more N/A answers than without role-playing. Therefore, we
leave exploring the role of vision modality tasks and the role
of CogVLM as future work.
