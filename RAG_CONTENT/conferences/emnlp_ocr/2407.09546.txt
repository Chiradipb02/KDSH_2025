Abstract
The utilization of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in financial trading has primarily
been concentrated within the stock market,
aiding in economic and financial decisions.
Yet, the unique opportunities presented by
the cryptocurrency market, noted for its
on-chain data’s transparency and the critical
influence of off-chain signals like news,
remain largely untapped by LLMs. This
work aims to bridge the gap by developing
an LLM-based trading agent, CryptoTrade,
which uniquely combines the analysis of
on-chain and off-chain data. This approach
leverages the transparency and immutability
of on-chain data, as well as the timeliness
and influence of off-chain signals, providing a
comprehensive overview of the cryptocurrency
market. CryptoTrade incorporates a reflective
mechanism specifically engineered to refine
its daily trading decisions by analyzing the
outcomes of prior trading decisions. This
research makes two significant contributions.
Firstly, it broadens the applicability of LLMs
to the domain of cryptocurrency trading.
Secondly, it establishes a benchmark for
cryptocurrency trading strategies. Through
extensive experiments, CryptoTrade has
demonstrated superior performance in maxi-
mizing returns compared to traditional trading
strategies and time-series baselines across
various cryptocurrencies and market conditions.

1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized
financial decision-making and stock market prediction
by excelling in tasks such as sentiment analysis (Liang
et al., 2022) and explanation generation (Pu et al., 2023).
Specialized models like FinGPT and BloombergGPT
(Liu et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023) demonstrate this capa-
bility. Recent research highlights their ability to inter-
pret financial time-series and enhance cross-sequence
∗Equal contributionreasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2023; Zhang et al.,
2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024). Further-
more, the development of LLM-based trading agents
like Sociodojo (Cheng and Chin, 2024) underscores the
potential for innovating investment strategies.
However, the application of LLMs in the cryptocur-
rency market remains underexplored, yet this field holds
great potential for future development for three main rea-
sons. First, the cryptocurrency market is characterized
by high market value, volatility, and uncertainty, which
challenge traditional trading signals (Dro ˙zd˙z et al., 2023;
Wei et al., 2023). Second, LLMs have demonstrated
their ability to understand and analyze financial mar-
kets by leveraging large volumes of multi-modal data,
such as news and price information (Wu et al., 2023).
Third, the cryptocurrency market includes open-sourced
on-chain data, such as gas prices and total transaction
values, providing insights beyond just price movements
(Feichtinger et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023). To bridge
this gap, we introduce CryptoTrade. By integrating
on-chain data, including market data and transaction
records, with off-chain information like financial news,
CryptoTrade leverages both dimensions to execute daily
trading strategies, taking full advantage of the trans-
parency of on-chain data and the immediacy of off-chain
information. We detail the structure of CryptoTrade in
Figure 1.
CryptoTrade consists of a three-part framework. Ini-
tially, we collect data where on-chain details such as
transactions and broader market data are aggregated
alongside off-chain data from established financial news
outlets like Bloomberg and Yahoo Finance. Following
collection, we conduct statistical analyses to derive in-
dicators such as moving averages and utilizing text pro-
cessing for news summarization using GPT-3.5-turbo1.
Finally, we enhance day-to-day decision-making with
specialized analytical agents: market analyst agent eval-
uates market trends, news analyst agent interprets recent
news impacts, and trading agent deliberates on invest-
ment actions. Concurrently, reflection agent reviews
past performance, allowing CryptoTrade to refine its
strategies to maximize returns.
Then, we conduct comprehensive experiments with

On-chain Data
Off-chain DataFigure 1: CryptoTrade Framework. Our framework begins with the collection of various types of data, including
on-chain transactions, market data, and off-chain data from multiple financial news sources. We extract on-chain
statistics while summarizing off-chain news to provide comprehensive inputs for our agents’ analysis. We then
deploy several LLM-based agents to make day-to-day trading decisions, utilizing a reflective mechanism to maximize
total returns over different time periods.
CryptoTrade using GPT-42, and GPT-4o3, evaluating its
proficiency in making daily trading decisions for Bit-
coin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). These
three cryptocurrencies were selected for their promi-
nence and market values of $134.14, $45.59, and $7.61
billion, respectively, as of June 2nd, 20244. CryptoTrade
significantly outperforms time-series baselines such as
Informer (Zhou et al., 2021) and PatchTST (Nie et al.,
2022), and achieves comparable performance to trading
signals like Moving Average Convergence Divergence
(MACD) (Gencay, 1996) in both return and sharpe ra-
tio across bull, sideways, and bear market conditions.
Notably, CryptoTrade operates in a zero-shot manner
without fine-tuning based on validation sets, highlight-
ing its potential for future applications. For instance,
during the ETH bullish test period, the Buy and Hold
strategy secured a 22.59% return, while CryptoTrade
exceeded this by a remarkable 3%.
To summarize, we make the following three contribu-
tions:
•We introduce CryptoTrade, an innovative trading
agent in the cryptocurrency domain, driven by
LLMs. CryptoTrade is designed to generate op-
timized trading decisions specifically for the cryp-
2https://platform.openai.com/docs/
models/gpt-4
3https://platform.openai.com/docs/
models/gpt-4o
4https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tocurrency market, setting a new benchmark in this
field.
•We develop a comprehensive framework for cryp-
tocurrency trading agents that encompasses the col-
lection of both on-chain and off-chain data, along
with the integration of a self-reflective component
to enhance decision-making processes. This ap-
proach aggregates diverse information sources and
establishes a new standard for data-driven trading
strategies within the cryptocurrency domain.
•Through rigorous experiments, we present empir-
ical evidence showcasing the efficacy of Crypto-
Trade compared to other baselines. CryptoTrade
advances the frontier of cryptocurrency trading
technologies and offers valuable insights for finan-
cial decision-making.
2 CryptoTrade Framework
This section details the components employed to de-
velop the CryptoTrade agent, including data collection,
market dynamics analysis, and agents development. Fig-
ure 1 shows an overview of CryptoTrade.
2.1 Data Collection
The foundation of our methodology relies on a compre-
hensive collection of data from on-chain and off-chain
sources, which is essential for making informed trad-
ing decisions in the cryptocurrency market. The datalicense is detailed in Appendix A. The data ethics are
explained in Appendix B. The data collection strategy
is illustrated in Figure 1(a) and further detailed below:
•On-chain Data: We leverage historical data from
CoinMarketCap5, which provides daily insights
into prices, trading volumes, and market capitaliza-
tion of various cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL.
This dataset forms the backbone of our market
trend analysis, enabling us to decipher long-term
trends and identify cycles in cryptocurrency valua-
tions and investor behavior.
Additionally, we incorporate detailed transac-
tion statistics from on-chain activities. All
blockchain transactions are transparent, trace-
able, and publicly accessible, achieved through
securely linked blocks using cryptographic tech-
niques (Narayanan et al., 2016). As numerous
prominent blockchain explorers provide tools for
easy access to blockchain transaction data, we re-
trieve on-chain transaction data from the Dune
Database6, a crypto analytics platform, and con-
struct comprehensive statistics related to these
transactions to include information on market dy-
namics. This includes comprehensive metrics such
as daily number of transactions, number of active
wallet, total value transferred, average gas price,
and total gas consumed. These features are cru-
cial for understanding the operational aspects of
blockchains, such as network congestion times and
cost efficiency, which directly impact trading strate-
gies. Our daily collection of these metrics facili-
tates a nuanced analysis of market dynamics and
liquidity, allowing for real-time adjustments to our
trading algorithms based on current market condi-
tions.
•Off-chain Data: We employ the Gnews API7to
systematically gather news articles related to each
cryptocurrency. This tool enables us to access a
wide array of sources through Google News, pro-
viding a comprehensive daily snapshot of mar-
ket sentiment. Moreover, we particularly focus
on filtering news from reputable financial and
cryptocurrency-specific outlets such as Bloomberg,
Yahoo Finance, and crypto.news8to ensure the
reliability and relevance of the information. The
integration of analysis from these articles allows
us to capture the market’s sentiment and response
to developments, which is often a precursor to sig-
nificant market movements.
By merging both on-chain data and off-chain news
insights, our methodology offers a holistic view of the

7https://pypi.org/project/gnews/
8https://crypto.news/cryptocurrency market. This integration not only en-
hances our analytical capabilities but also significantly
improves the precision of our trading decisions.
2.2 Market and News Analyst Agents
Upon collecting extensive on-chain and off-chain data,
we analyze it through two key components of our Cryp-
toTrade agent: (1) market analyst agent, (2) news ana-
lyst. By leveraging the capabilities of GPT-3.5-turbo,
these analysts provide deep insights into the crypto mar-
ket, enabling informed and strategic trading decisions.
Market Analyst Agent. The market analyst agent
plays a crucial role in deciphering market dynam-
ics through the statistical analysis of key trading sig-
nals from on-chain data, such as MA (Gencay, 1996),
MACD (Wang and Kim, 2018), and Bollinger Bands
(Day et al., 2023). Details of these trading signals are
provided in Appendix E. Armed with this information,
the market analyst agent compiles reports on the mar-
ket’s direction and momentum. An example is shown in
Figure 4.
News Analyst Agent. The news analyst agent is
tasked with extracting and analyzing critical informa-
tion from the latest news to assess the potential market
impact of off-chain social hype. By sourcing news sum-
maries from various trusted sources, the news analyst
agent pinpoints relevant recent events and assesses the
significance and implications of key topics, thus adding
an extra dimension of insight. An example is provided
in Figure 5.
2.3 Trading Agent
Each day, the trading agent offers an investment sugges-
tion based on reports from the market and news analyst
agents. After analyzing the reports, the trading agent
provides a concise rationale for its decisions. It also rec-
ommends allocating a certain portion of remaining cash
to purchase cryptocurrency (with a range from (0to1]),
selling a certain portion of owned cryptocurrency (with
a range from [−1to0)), or holding (neither buying nor
selling). When a trading decision is made, a transaction
fee is charged in proportion to the traded value. Figure 6
illustrates an example of our trading agent’s operations.
2.4 Reflection Agent
The reflection agent reviews the trading agent’s recent
activities to enhance future strategies. By analyzing the
previous week’s prompts, decisions, and returns, the
reflection agent identifies the most impactful informa-
tion and the reasons behind its significance, providing
feedback to the trading agent for future decisions. Con-
sequently, CryptoTrade learns to focus on the most influ-
ential information for upcoming decisions. An example
is illustrated in Figure 7.
3 Experiments
In this section, we detail the experiments designed to
evaluate the efficacy of our proprietary CryptoTradeagent in comparison to established baseline strategies
within the trading domain.
3.1 Experimental Setup
Experiment Environments. We conduct all experi-
ments using PyTorch on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX
3090 GPU. More details are in Appendix C.
Datasets. To ensure our experiments are robust across
different cryptocurrencies and market conditions, we
base our study on a dataset covering several months,
detailed in Table 1. This dataset reflects the recent mar-
ket performance of BTC, ETH, and SOL, presenting
challenges in capturing market trends and volatility. We
divide the dataset into validation and test sets, using the
former to select model hyperparameters and the latter
to evaluate model performance. We carefully select the
test period after September 2021, the GPT-3.5’s knowl-
edge cutoff date, to prevent data leakage. The dataset
encompasses three market conditions: bull, sideways,
and bear, allowing us to test the effectiveness of both
the baselines and our model (Baroiu et al., 2023; Cagan,
2024), ensuring reliable and robust experimental results.
Evaluation Scheme. We initialize the trading agent
with 1 million US dollars, split equally between cash
and BTC/ETH/SOL, to enable potential profits from
both buying and selling cryptocurrencies. At the end
of the trading session, we use the following widely-
accepted metrics: Return ,Sharpe Ratio ,Daily Return
Mean , and Daily Return Std . This evaluation scheme
ensures a rigorous and unbiased assessment of both
baseline strategies and our CryptoTrade agent.
(1) Return measures the overall performance of
the trading strategy, calculated using the formula
wend−wstart
wstart , where wstartandwendrepresent the start-
ing and ending net worth, respectively.
(2) Sharpe Ratio assesses the risk-adjusted return,
using the formula¯r−rf
σ, where ¯ris the mean of daily
returns, σis the standard deviation of daily returns, and
rfis the risk-free return, set to 0 following SocioDojo
(Cheng and Chin, 2024).
(3) Daily Return Mean is the average of the daily
returns over the trading period, providing insight into
the typical daily performance of the trading strategy.
(4) Daily Return Std is the standard deviation of the
daily returns, indicating the volatility and risk associated
with the daily performance of the trading strategy.
Baseline Strategies. To benchmark the performance of
our CryptoTrade agent, we compare it against widely
recognized baseline strategies in the trading domain.
We present these baselines and hyperparameters in Ap-
pendix E.
3.2 Experimental Results
The performance comparison presented in Table 2, Ta-
ble 3, Table 4 between various trading strategies and our
proposed CryptoTrade agent reveals significant insights
into the efficacy of incorporating advanced data analysistechniques for cryptocurrency trading. The table high-
lights the returns and Sharpe Ratios for each method,
where our CryptoTrade agent performs with outstand-
ing percentage return and Sharpe Ratio. We outline the
superiority of CryptoTrade in two key aspects:
Superior Performance under Different Market Con-
ditions. Remarkably, even without fine-tuning, Crypto-
Trade outperforms Transformer-based time-series base-
lines in most bases, demonstrating the robust capabili-
ties of LLMs. Additionally, its performance is compara-
ble to traditional trading signals like Buy and Hold and
MACD, further validating the potential of LLM-based
approaches. For instance, CryptoTrade (GPT-4o) excels
in all metrics under ETH’s bull market by 3% in total
return and sharpe ratio. While CryptoTrade (GPT-4o)
may not always be the top performer in every scenario,
it consistently surpasses more than half of the trading
signals across different market conditions, even without
fine-tuning. This highlights the effectiveness and ver-
satility of CryptoTrade in leveraging LLMs to navigate
the complexities of the cryptocurrency market.
Successful Trend Predictions. We draw Figure 2 to
demonstrate the correlation between Ethereum’s open-
ing prices and the positions held by the CryptoTrade
agent, with the yellow and blue lines representing daily
opening prices and Ethereum positions, respectively.
The observed fluctuations highlight the market’s volatil-
ity, while the alignment between position adjustments
and price movements showcases the agent’s proficiency
in anticipating market trends. Unlike the static Buy and
Hold strategy, CryptoTrade adopts a dynamic approach,
optimizing trades based on market analysis—purchasing
at lower prices and selling at peaks. This strategic
adaptability, especially evident during shaded periods
of preemptive position changes in anticipation of price
shifts, underscores the agent’s capacity for risk manage-
ment and its adeptness at leveraging market volatility
for profit, marking a significant advancement over tradi-
tional trading strategies.
3.3 Ablation Study
The ablation study presented in Table 5 critically ex-
amines the individual components of the prompt used
by the CryptoTrade (GPT-4o) agent. By systematically
removing key elements from the full prompt and observ-
ing the impact on percentage return and Sharpe ratio
during a bull market for ETH, we can identify the con-
tribution of each component to the overall performance
of the trading strategy.We highlight the following two
insights from the results:
Superiority of the Full Prompt. The full prompt signif-
icantly outshines all other configurations with reduced
components. The advantage of employing a full prompt
over all deducted variants is rooted in the integration
of diverse data sources. The full prompt encompasses
the comprehensive price data, news analysis, technical
indicators, on-chain transaction statistics, and reflective
analysis to offer a holistic view of the market. ThisTable 1: Dataset splits. Prices are in US dollars. In each split, the transaction days include the start date and exclude
the end date. We evaluate the total profit on the end date.

highlights the necessity of integrating on-chain trans-
action data, revealing its unique value in enriching thedecision-making process in the cryptocurrency trading

3.4 Case Study
To assess the adaptability and responsiveness of the
CryptoTrade agent, we conduct a case study focusing
on its responsive actions in the context of the cryptocur-
rency market’s major events, illustrated in Figure 3. It
reveals that CryptoTrade’s strategy aligns with the "buy
the rumor, sell the news" principle, effectively capitaliz-
ing on early signs of the Bitcoin ETF approval event, a
scenario known to trigger market rallies due to specula-
tive trading. By entering the market early, CryptoTrade
secures positions at lower costs ahead of the rally.
As the approval of the Bitcoin ETF becomes a reality,
the sentiment reaches a crescendo, resulting in inflated
asset prices due to heightened demand. CryptoTrade,2023-12-17 2023-12-21 2023-12-25 2023-12-29 2024-01-01 2024-01-05 2024-01-09 2024-01-13 2024-01-17180019002000210022002300240025002600Price

adhering to its strategic motivation, takes this peak as
an optimal point to sell, which is validated in the subse-
quent decline in the Ethereum price. This strategic exit
allows CryptoTrade to realize gains before the market
adjusted to the new equilibrium, which results in a price
pullback as early speculators take profits and the market
sentiment normalizes.
To sum up, CryptoTrade’s provident actions under-
score the delicate balance between foresight and timing
in trading strategies. This case study demonstrates that
an informed and timely response to market signals —
both rumors and confirmed news — can yield advan-
tageous outcomes. It also highlights the CryptoTrade
agent’s understanding of market psychology and its abil-
ity to translate this into profitable trading decisions.
4 Related Work
LLMs for Economics and Financial Decisions Recent
advancements in LLMs have significantly influenced
economics and financial decision-making. Specialized
LLMs like FinGPT, BloombergGPT, FinMA (Liu et al.,
2023; Wu et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023) are tailored
for finance, handling tasks such as sentiment analysis,
entity recognition, and question-answering. Another
research direction uses LLMs for financial time-series
forecasting. A notable contribution by (Yu et al., 2023)
employed zero-shot or few-shot inference with GPT-4
and instruction-based fine-tuning with LlaMA to en-
hance cross-sequence reasoning and multi-modal signal
integration. Additionally, the development of LLM-
based agents for financial trading has gained attention.
Sociodojo (Cheng and Chin, 2024) created analytical
agents for stock portfolio management, showing the po-
tential for generating "hyperportfolios." Despite theseadvancements, the focus has largely been on the stock
market (Koa et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023), leaving
a gap in the exploration of the cryptocurrency market
where the on-chain data is approachable and with much
information. Our work aims to address this gap by lever-
aging both on-chain and off-chain data to navigate the
dynamic cryptocurrency market.
Time-Series Forecasting for Financial Markets
Time-series forecasting has long been a cornerstone
of research in economics and financial markets. Early
studies focused on predicting stock market prices us-
ing methodologies such as machine learning (Leung
et al., 2021; Patel and Yalamalle, 2014), reinforcement
learning (Lee, 2001), and traditional time-series mod-
els (Herwartz, 2017). The Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) model has emerged as particularly influential
(Sunny et al., 2020) for its capability to process and
analyze time-series data. With the rise of blockchain
technology and cryptocurrencies, these techniques have
been extended to crypto assets (Khedr et al., 2021). Re-
cent research has evaluated the impact of various predic-
tors on cryptocurrency pricing and returns, using both
on-chain data—such as historical transactions and mar-
ket volume (Ferdiansyah et al., 2019)—and off-chain
factors like social media trends and news sentiment
(Abraham et al., 2018; Pang et al., 2019). These stud-
ies underscore the effectiveness of integrating diverse
data sources for forecasting the volatile dynamics of the
cryptocurrency market. Apart from above, Transformer-
based models have shown particular promise in this area,
with state-of-the-art models like Informer (Zhou et al.,
2021), AutoFormer (Wu et al., 2021), PatchTST (Nie
et al., 2022), and TimesNet (Wu et al., 2022) further
advancing time-series forecasting.Self-Reflective Language Agents The Self-Refine
framework introduces an advanced approach for au-
tonomous advancement through self-evaluation and iter-
ative self-improvement (Madaan et al., 2024). This
approach, along with efforts to automatically refine
prompts (Pryzant et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2024) and pro-
vide automated feedback to enhance reasoning capa-
bilities (Paul et al., 2023), marks significant progress
in the field. Notably, the "Reflexion" framework by
(Shinn et al., 2024) revolutionizes the reinforcement of
language agents by utilizing linguistic feedback and re-
flective text within an episodic memory buffer, diverging
from traditional weight update methods. These advance-
ments highlight the potential for LLMs to learn from
their errors and evolve through self-reflection. Despite
these developments, there is still untapped potential
in applying self-reflective language agents to financial
decision-making, particularly in cryptocurrency mar-
kets. This work aims to bridge that gap by investigating
the application of self-reflective mechanisms to enhance
financial decision-making processes in cryptocurrency
trading.
5 Conclusion
We propose the CryptoTrade agent, an innovative ap-
proach to cryptocurrency trading that leverages ad-
vanced data analysis and LLMs. By integrating both
on-chain and off-chain data, along with a self-reflective
component, the CryptoTrade agent demonstrates a
sophisticated understanding of market dynamics and
achieves relatively high returns in cryptocurrency trad-
ing. Our comprehensive experiments comparing the
CryptoTrade agent to traditional trading strategies and
time-series models reveal its superior ability to navi-
gate the volatile cryptocurrency market, consistently
achieving relatively high returns on investment under
different market conditions. This research underscores
the significant potential of LLM-driven strategies in en-
hancing trading performance and sets a new benchmark
for cryptocurrency trading with LLMs.
6 Limitations
One limitation of the current CryptoTrade framework
is the reliance on a relatively limited dataset. To ad-
dress this, we plan to enrich the dataset with additional
off-chain data. Another limitation is the frequency of
trading actions, which is currently set to day-to-day. We
aim to refine this to hour-to-hour or minute-to-minute
intervals to further optimize returns in the cryptocur-
rency market. Additionally, we have identified that the
lack of fine-tuning for the LLMs using the validation
set may be a significant factor behind the LLM-based
agents’ underperformance compared to traditional trad-
ing signals. To improve the reliability of our forecasts,
we intend to fine-tune the LLMs with the validation set.7 Broader Impact
One potential broader impact of our research is the risk
that individuals may follow the trading strategies we
provide and subsequently incur financial losses. It is
important to emphasize that these strategies are intended
for academic research only. CryptoTrade is not for
investment recommendations.

The open prices have been relatively stable and there has been a consistent increase in the number of transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred. The average gas price has also been fluctuating but overall remains at a relatively high level.The technical indicators such as the short-long moving average signal, MACD signal, and Bollinger Bands signal all suggest a "buy" sentiment. Additionally, the majority oftransactions have been successful, indicating a strong level of activity and interest in the market.Overall, the data points towards a positive market trend for Ethereum, with potential for further growth in the near future. Investors may consider taking advantage of the current bullish momentum in their trading strategies.

Ethereum Is Turning Deflationary, But Price Remains Stagnant:-The Ethereum network has burned over half the coins issued since the merge, making it somewhat deflationary.-Despite the burns, ETH prices have not heavily responded, possibly due to less demand at the moment.-The end goal is for the burn rate to outpace the rate of issuing new coins, potentially making ETH truly deflationary.-Ethereum was trading at $1,833.89, down by 0.2% in the last 24 hours.2. Lido adoption surges with 10,000 new stakersdespite Ethereum's price struggles:-More than 10,000 new stakersjoined Lido (LDO) in July, indicating continued adoption and growth.-Ethereum's price struggles have impacted Lido's Total Value Locked (TVL), but it remains a leading DeFiprotocol.-Predictions suggest staked Ethereum via Lido will surpass eight million in August.-Despite challenges like the Curve Finance exploit, Lido's adoption and staked ETH continue to grow.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency traderand you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You will start with 1 million dollars, half in cash and half in ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.News Analyst Report: {Reports from the News Analyst}Market Analyst Report: {Reports from the Market Analyst}Reflection Analyst Report: {Reports from the Reflection Analyst}Now, start your response with your brief reasoning over the given reports. Wisely select the useful information, conclude a clear market trend, pay more attention to long-term trends instead of short-term benefits, and avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of [-1,1]. When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to suggest a positive value to buy ETH. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to suggest a negative value to sell ETH. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) appears to be overall bullish. The on-chain analysis indicates a positive market trend with bullish indicators such as increasing transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred. The technical indicators also suggest a "buy" sentiment, further supporting the bullish trend.Additionally, the news analysis highlights the deflationary nature of Ethereum due to coin burns, which could potentially lead to further price appreciation in the future. Despite some price struggles, the adoption of protocols like Lido continues to grow, indicating a strong interest in Ethereum.Considering the fluctuating but overall bullish market trend, I would recommend buying ETH with a confidence level of -0.8. This action aligns with the positive market sentiment and potential for further growth in the near future.

Identify key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades. Also assess whether a more aggressive or conservative trading approach is warranted. Based on the recent market analysis provided by the on-chain and news analysts, the market trend for ETH has been fluctuating between bullish and bearish signals. The initial bullish trend led to a profitable decision to buy ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, resulting in a positive daily return. However, the subsequent shift to a bearish trend led to a decision to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.8, resulting in a negative daily return. The following action of buying ETH with a confidence level of -0.6 also resulted in a negative daily return.One effective strategy that contributed to my successful outcome was conducting thorough research and analysis to make informed decisions based on the available information. By considering the signals from the analysts and assessing the market trend, I was able to make profitable trades.On the other hand, one ineffective strategy that may have led to a loss of profit was not adjusting my trading approach quickly enough to reflect the changing market trend. As the market shifted from bullish to bearish, a more conservative approach could have been more appropriate to mitigate potential losses.Looking ahead, key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include overall market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements in the Ethereum network.

trading signals generated at their crossover points.
We use different combinations of short and long
SMA periods, selecting the optimal ones based on
validation set performance.
4.MACD (Wang and Kim, 2018): A strategy that
uses the MACD indicator to identify potential buy
and sell opportunities based on the momentum of
the asset. The MACD is calculated as the differ-
ence between the 12-day EMA and the 26-day
EMA, with a 9-day EMA of the MACD line serv-
ing as the signal line. EMA stands for Exponential
Moving Average. It is a type of moving average
that places a greater weight and significance on the
most recent data points.
5.Bollinger Bands (Day et al., 2023): This strat-
egy generates trading signals based on price move-
ments relative to the middle, lower, and upper
Bollinger Bands. Bollinger Bands are constructed
using a 20-day SMA and a multiplier (commonly
set to 2) for the standard deviation. We use the
recommended period and multiplier settings for
this strategy.
6.LSTM (Ferdiansyah et al., 2019)): This strat-
egy involves comparing today’s price with the
predicted price for tomorrow to identify poten-
tial buying and selling opportunities. We fine-
tune the look-back window size using values in
[1,3,5,10,20,30]and select the parameters that
perform best on the validation set.7.Informer (Zhou et al., 2021): Informer utilizes
an efficient self-attention mechanism to capture
dependencies among variables. We adopt the rec-
ommended configuration for our experimental set-
tings: a dropout rate of 0.05, two encoder layers,
one decoder layer, a learning rate of 0.0001, and the
Adam optimizer (Yi et al., 2024). The look-back
window size is selected using the same procedure
as for the LSTM.
8.AutoFormer (Wu et al., 2021): AutoFormer intro-
duces a decomposition architecture by embedding
the series decomposition block as an inner opera-
tor, allowing for the progressive aggregation of the
long-term trend from intermediate predictions. We
use the recommended configuration for our exper-
imental settings (Yi et al., 2024). The look-back
window size is selected using the same procedure
as for the LSTM.
9.TimesNet (Wu et al., 2022): TimesNet provides
a general framework for various time-series fore-
casting tasks. We adopt the recommended config-
urations for our experimental settings (Wu et al.,
2022). The look-back window size is selected us-
ing the same procedure as for the LSTM.
10.PatchTST (Nie et al., 2022): PatchTST proposes
an effective design for Transformer-based models
in time series forecasting by introducing two key
components: patching and a channel-independent
structure (Yi et al., 2024). The recommended con-
figurations are used for our experimental settings.
The look-back window size is selected using the
same procedure as for the LSTM.

After careful consideration, we have chosen to host our
code and data on GitHub. Our decision is based on
various factors, including the platform’s ease of use,
cost-effectiveness, and scalability. We understand that
accessibility is key when it comes to data management,
which is why we will ensure that our data is easily ac-
cessible through a curated interface. We also recognize
the importance of maintaining the platform’s stability
and functionality, and as such, we will provide the nec-
essary maintenance to ensure that it remains up-to-date,
bug-free, and running smoothly.
At the heart of our project is the belief in open access
to data, and we are committed to making our data avail-
able to those who need it. As part of this commitment,
we will be updating our GitHub repository regularly, so
that users can rely on timely access to the most current
information. We hope that by using GitHub as our host-
ing platform, we can provide a user-friendly and reliable
solution for sharing our data with others.
