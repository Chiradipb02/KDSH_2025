Abstract
The utilisation of Plug-and-Play (PnP) priors in inverse problems has become increasingly
prominent in recent years. This preference is based on the mathematical equivalence between
the general proximal operator and the regularised denoiser, facilitating the adaptation of
various off-the-shelf denoiser priors to a wide range of inverse problems. However, existing
PnP models predominantly rely on pre-trained denoisers using large datasets. In this work, we
introduce Single-Shot PnP methods (SS-PnP), shifting the focus to solving inverse problems
with minimal data. First, we integrate Single-Shot proximal denoisers into iterative methods,
enabling training with single instances. Second, we propose implicit neural priors based on
a novel function that preserves relevant frequencies to capture fine details while avoiding
the issue of vanishing gradients. We demonstrate, through extensive numerical and visual
experiments, that our method leads to better approximations.
1 Introduction
Inverse problems have long been a fundamental challenge in the field of mathematics and applied sciences,
encompassing a wide range of applications from image reconstruction to signal processing (Devaney, 2012;
Bertero et al., 2021). Traditionally, these problems have been approached through various analytical and
numerical methods (Vogel, 2002; Jordan, 1881; Metropolis & Ulam, 1949) using either single or multiple
images (without a deep net or learning process). However, the advent of deep learning has revolutionised
this domain. Deep inverse problems present a modern approach, offering new insights and solutions where
conventional methods have limitations (McCann et al., 2017). This shift towards leveraging machine learning
techniques marks a significant evolution in tackling inverse problems, opening doors to more sophisticated
and efficient problem-solving techniques.
A popular framework in this deep inverse problem era is Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods (Venkatakrishnan
et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2021; Chan et al., 2016; Ono, 2017). At the core of this approach lies the
mathematical equivalence of the proximal operator to denoising (Venkatakrishnan et al., 2013), a concept that
intertwines optimisation theory with modern denoisers. This equivalence paves the way for the integration
of advanced deep learning-based denoisers into the inverse problem-solving process. The Plug-and-Play
framework essentially allows for the seamless insertion of these denoisers into iterative algorithms, enhancing
their ability to recover high-quality signals or images from corrupted observations (Zhang et al., 2021; 2019;
Ahmad et al., 2020).

Although PnP methods have demonstrated outstanding results across a wide range of inverse problems, they
predominantly rely on the assumption of having substantial training datasets for the development of robust
denoising models (Arridge et al., 2019). This requirement often becomes a significant bottleneck, especially in
scenarios where data availability is limited or the diversity of data is not sufficiently representative. Moreover,
PnP methods typically necessitate retraining or fine-tuning to adapt effectively to varying distributions and
signal characteristics. To address these challenges, Single-Shot learning emerges as a promising alternative,
offering a paradigm shift in how deep inverse problems can be trained with minimal data. Unlike traditional
methods that require extensive datasets, Single-Shot learning aims to make significant inferences from a single
instance, or in some cases, a small set of instances. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work on
Single-Shot PnP methods. Our work thus opens the door to a novel research line for PnP, introducing the
concept of Single-Shot Plug-and-Play methods.
Single-Shot techniques offer a viable solution to the current constraints in PnP methods, particularly in
their reliance on extensive training datasets. This shift enables us to delve into the recent advancements
in signal representation, specifically, the emergence of neural implicit representations. Neural implicit
representations (Strümpler et al., 2022; Saragadam et al., 2023; Tancik et al., 2020) are trained to learn
continuous functions that map coordinates to signal values or features, making this form of representation
highly efficient in capturing intricate data details with a compact network architecture. Its application in
the context of Single-Shot PnP methods is particularly promising, as denoisers that can effectively operate
with limited data inputs, aligning with the Single-Shot learning paradigm. We therefore use implicit neural
representations as a way to represent the proximal denoiser in PnP techniques in a Single-Shot fashion. Our
contributions are:

in which we highlight:
We introduce Single-Shot proximal denoisers into iterative methods for solving any inverse
problem. Our scheme eliminates the need for a pre-trained model, enabling training with a
single instance.
We introduce implicit neural priors for Plug-and-Play methods that enables the network to
preserve more details during training. Additionally, we provide a theoretical justification for our
prior, emphasising how its continuity and differentiability play a crucial role in mitigating the
issue of vanishing gradients during the training process and preserve fine details.
/hand-p⌢int-rightWe demonstrate, through extensive experiments on several inverse problems, that our technique
leads to a better approximation on capturing finer details, smoother edge features and better colour
representation. The method is evaluated on inverse problems with both single operator task and
multi-operator task like joint demosaicing and deconvolution task. With only one image input in the
whole reconstruction process, it outperforms the classical methods and pre-trained models among all
the tasks.
2 Related Work
In this section, we review the existing literature and the concepts closely related to our work.
Plug-and-Play (PnP) Methods. They have revolutionised the field of inverse problems by integrating
advanced denoisers into iterative algorithms. This innovative approach, initiated by Venkatakrishnan et al.
(2013), has undergone significant evolution. Meinhardt et al. (2017) showcased its effectiveness in diverse
imaging tasks, marking a turning point in PnP’s development. The subsequent works (Ryu et al., 2019;
Sun et al., 2019; Hurault et al., 2022) further refined PnP, enhancing its stability and convergence, thus
broadening its applicability.
In addition, the works of that (Teodoro et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2017b; Ono, 2017; Sun
et al., 2019) further expanded the scope of PnP, demonstrating its adaptability in complex imaging scenarios.
A notable advancement in the optimisation landscape came with the introduction of TFPnP (Tuning-Free
2Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
Plug-and-Play) (Wei et al., 2020), which innovatively eliminated the need for parameter tuning in PnP
algorithms.
Previous methods have relied on data-driven pre-training, which becomes impractical in situations with
limited data or on smaller devices due to the extensive size of the required models. Consequently, developing
a method for Single-Shot image prior denoising emerges as a compelling solution for such resource-constrained
environments.
A wide range of denoisers has been used within the PnP framework. Classical denoisers such as BM3D (Dabov
et al., 2007) have been the most prevalent. Other notable approaches include Teodoro et al. (2016)
and Venkatakrishnan et al. (2013). These traditional denoisers are well-established and often require
little or no data pre-training. On the other hand, another emerging family of denoisers leverages deep learning
techniques (Meinhardt et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017b; Laumont et al., 2022). These deep learning-based
denoisers have gained prominence for their ability to capture complex features and patterns in data, making
them highly effective in PnP frameworks. The aim of this paper is to further explore and advance the use of
deep learning-based denoisers, particularly in scenarios with minimal data, through the proposed Single-Shot
methodology.
Single-Shot Image Denoising. A crucial element in PnP methods is the denoiser model. During the
last years, the denoiser technique in PnP has evolved remarkably, transitioning from traditional methods
to advanced deep learning techniques. Pioneering works such as the BM3D algorithm (Dabov et al., 2007)
and the Non-Local Means (NLM) algorithm (Buades et al., 2005) laid the groundwork, setting significant
benchmarks. The introduction of deep learning marked a paradigm shift, exemplified by the DnCNN model
proposed by Zhang et al. (2017a) and its variant DnCNN-S (Zhang et al., 2018), which demonstrated the
efficacy of convolutional networks in denoising. The Deep Image Prior (DIP) by Lempitsky et al. (2018)
furthered this progression, utilising the structure of convolutional networks as a prior for denoising.
A notable advancement is the rising of self-supervised methods, which revolutionised the Single-Shot denoising
field by eliminating the need for clean training data. The Noise2Void framework by Krull et al. (2019) and
the Noise2Self algorithm (Batson & Royer, 2019) are pioneering examples, utilising concepts like blind-spot
networks for effective denoising. Building on these, Self2Self (Quan et al., 2020), Noise2Same (Xie et al.,
2020), and Noise2Info (Wang et al., 2023) further explored self-supervision, offering unique strategies for
leveraging the inherent properties of noisy images. Additional approaches like CycleISP (Zamir et al., 2020),
IRCNN (Zhang et al., 2017b), GCDN (Anwar & Barnes, 2020), and bayesian denoising with blind-spot
networks (Laine et al., 2019) further enrich the landscape, each contributing novel perspectives and solutions
to the challenge of Single-Shot image denoising.
These advancements are not confined to noise reduction alone; many of the developed deep denoisers are
inherently adaptable and can be generalised to tackle various inverse problems in imaging. Inverse problems,
such as demosaicing, denoising, and deconvolution, share common traits with denoising. The underlying
principles and network architectures developed for denoising can often be extended or fine-tuned to address
these challenges (Romano et al., 2017; Akyüz et al., 2020). Furthermore, the concept of Plug-and-Play
methods opens up new avenues. However, this progress highlights a gap: despite the evolution of Single-Shot
denoisers, there is currently no work on Single-Shot denoisers into iterative algorithms. Therefore, this work
introduces the concept of Single-Shot Plug-and-Play methods.
Despite the versatility of Single-Shot image denoising, CNN-based estimators frequently fail to capture
continuously high-frequency details crucial for image reconstruction. Implicit neural representation (INR)
emerges as a solution, adept at addressing these high-frequency challenges in inverse problems.
Implicit Neural Representation , characterised as a fully connected network-based method, has seen a
rise in popularity for solving inverse problems as highlighted by Sun et al. (2021a). Traditional activation
functions like ReLU have exhibited limitations in representing high-frequency features, as discussed by Dabov
et al. (2007). This shortcoming has led to the exploration of nonlinear activation functions, such as the
sinusoidal function (Sitzmann et al., 2020), enhancing representational capabilities. The adaptability of INR
is evident in its diverse applications across medical imaging (Wang et al., 2022), image processing (Chen
et al., 2021; Attal et al., 2021), and super-resolution (Saragadam et al., 2023).

in Algorithm 1, and the ^indicates the fix in denoiser weight over the ADMM iterations, where there are
Kiterations in total (i.e. k∈{0,1,...,K−1}).
A distinct advantage of INR lies in its independence from pre-training, attributed to its rapid training
capability, as indicated by Saragadam et al. (2023). This feature makes INR particularly suitable for
Single-Shot image denoising tasks, where a single image suffices for effective learning, bypassing the need for
extensive data-driven pre-training. The ability of INR to learn from minimal data points underscores its
potential in resource-limited scenarios.
3 Methodology
Inverse imaging problems have emerged as a crucial cornerstone in computer vision and various related
domains. A conventional forward model reads:
y=A(x)+ϵ, (1)
wherey∈RMis the known observation, x∈RNis the unknown target of interest, ϵ∈RMis the measurement
noise, andA∶RN→RMis the forward measurement operator, which varies across different tasks.
The approximation of xgives rise to a highly ill-posed problem, necessitating regularisation. Consequently,
the fundamental objective for any imaging inverse problem is the minimisation of:
min
x∈RND(x)+γR(x), (2)
D(x)refers to the data fidelity term, usually taking the form D(x)=1
2∥A(x)−y∥2.R(x)denotes the
regularisation term, which encodes prior knowledge about x. The parameter γserves as the regularisation
weight, determining the trade-off between data fidelity and regularisation. A widely used approach to
solve equation 2 is the family of first-order optimisation methods (Beck & Teboulle, 2009b; Boyd et al., 2011;
Chambolle & Pock, 2011).
3.1 Single-Shot Proximal Denoiser
We introduce Single-Shot Plug-and-Play methods (SS-PnP) as demonstrated in Figure 1. The optimisation of
equation 2 typically exhibits non-smooth characteristics due to R. A widely adopted strategy for addressing
this problem is to employ first-order methods such as the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
Given a function F(⋅), we define the proximal operator of Fatvwith step size δas:
ProxδF(v)=argmin
u{1
2∥u−v∥2+δF(u)}, (3)
Considering ADMM, one can express PnP-ADMM as:

equivalence between the proximal operator Proxσ2
kR(⋅)and a denoiser Hσkwith the denoising parameter
σk≥0.
Single-Shot Denoiser is All You Need for PnP. PnP techniques primarily rely on denoisers, often
trained on extensive datasets and using off-the-shelf deep denoisers (Ryu et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019; Hurault
et al., 2022). However, an unexplored question is whether Single-Shot denoisers can be used in iterative
methods and what their properties are. To our knowledge, there are no existing works on this.
In our Single-Shot denoising stage, we utilise the observed image with noise y+εto train the denoiser,
enabling it to distinguish and mitigate complex noise and distortions specific to the example. The neural
networkfθaims to transform the noisy and corrupted image into its less corrupted counterpart. This is
achieved through an optimisation process given by:
ˆθ=argmin
θL(fθ,y+ε), (5)
where Lis a loss function that evaluates the difference between the network’s output and the corresponding
observed image with noise. Refer to Step 1 in Algorithm 1.
This pre-trained model is subsequently integrated into a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework as a prior for
regularisation. Let H=fˆθ, the trained denoiser serves as a guiding force in the iterative reconstruction
process, enhancing the ability to recover high-quality images from corrupted observations. By embedding
this Single-Shot learning model into the PnP framework, we establish a potent approach for tackling a range
5Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
of inverse problems, particularly in situations involving severely corrupted images. To promote the synergy
between Single-Shot learning and PnP methods, the fθutilise nonlinear INR denoiser. Refer to Step 2 in
Algorithm 1.
In this work, we consider ADMM justified by its well-known outstanding performance (Venkatakrishnan et al.,
2013; Wei et al., 2022) in comparison to existing methods, its well-established convergence properties (Ryu
et al., 2019), and its modular approach, which collectively ensure its effectiveness across various inverse
problem scenarios.
3.2 Implicit Neural Prior for Plug-and-Play
Implicit neural representations enable the learning of continuous functions from a signal. State-of-the-art
performance relies on deep denoisers like UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) and FFDNet (Zhang et al., 2018).
While convolutional-based denoisers have shown impressive results, there is currently no research exploring
the use of implicit neural representation (INR) as a prior for PnP methods. INR can be used as a Single-Shot
approach in equation 4, we then open the door to a new research direction for PnP.
INRboastsremarkableexpressivepowerandinductivebias, pavingthewayforinnovativedenoisingapproaches.
Another significant contribution of this work is the introduction of a new Single-Shot framework for PnP. In
particular, we present a novel INR prior. Unlike the majority of existing works, we provide a solid theoretical
justification for its properties and behavior.
Zooming into our Prior. We next define our proposed implicit neural representation prior.
Our INR Prior
We define a nonlinear activation function and form our implicit neural representation, which reads:
Φ(x)=exp{−(a1x+b1)2}sin(a2x+b2) (6)
+1
exp{−(a1x+b1)}+1
Our proposed activation function is nonlinear. Moreover, it has key properties of differentiability and
continuity.
Proof.Letg(x)=exp{−(a1x+b1)2}andf(x)=sin(a2x+b2). For∀c∈R,
(fg)(x)−(fg)(c)
x−c
=f(x)g(x)−f(c)g(x)+f(c)g(x)−f(c)g(c)
x−c
=f(x)−f(c)
x−cg(x)+f(c)g(x)−g(c)
x−c (7)
Consequently,
lim
x→c(fg)(x)−(fg)(c)
x−c
=lim
x→c[f(x)−f(c)
x−cg(x)+f(c)g(x)−g(c)
x−c]
=lim
x→cf(x)−f(c)
x−clim
x→cg(x)+f(c)lim
x→cg(x)−g(c)
x−c (8)
Because both g(x)andf(x)are continuous and differentiable, limx→c(fg)(x)−(fg)(c)
x−cexists for all c∈R.
Hence, exp{−(a1x+b1)2}sin(a2x+b2)is continuous and differentiable for all c∈R. Consequently, the entire
activation function is the sum of two differentiable functions, making it both continuous and differentiable.
6Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2024)
Why are these properties interesting? The nonlinearity, continuity, and differentiability brought by our formula
make it more representative compared to traditional activation functions, enabling the network to preserve
more details during training. Additionally, the continuity and differentiability of our formula play a crucial
role in mitigating the issue of vanishing gradients during training.
Convergence of our Prior
Consider the function Φ(x)in equation 6, then it holds that:
Φ(x)={0x→−∞
1x→∞(9)
This behavior ensures that Φ(x)remains bounded and avoids gradient explosion, making it a stable
function for optimisation.
Proof.Fory>0,∀ϵ>0,∃¯y=√
max(0,ln1
ϵ)wheny>¯y,
exp(y2)sin(a2x+b2)<exp(−y2)
=exp{−max(0,ln1
ϵ)}
=exp{min(0,lnϵ)}
⩽exp(lnϵ)=ϵ(10)
Meanwhile, the function1
exp(−y)+1converges to 1 when x→∞. Consequently, the function is convergent to 1
whenx→∞.
We underline that previous proof that the convergence results we present are specifically in terms of the
behaviour of the prior within our proposed framework. By leveraging the convergence and bounded nature
of the activation function, we can significantly mitigate the issue of exploding gradients. Moreover, as the
model converges to 0, it also effectively reduces the impact of outliers, enhancing the overall robustness of
our model.
4 Experiment
In this section, we describe the experiments undertaken to validate our proposed Single-Shot Plug-and-Play
framework.
4.1 Experimental Setting
In our image preprocessing, we utilised dual resizing strategies. We sourced the images with Creative Commons
Licenses and resized to 512×384, and in the meantime tested on the selected data in Bevilacqua et al.
(2012) and Zeyde et al. (2012), without resizing. We remind to the reader, the experiments on Single-Shot
Plug-and-Play methods (SS-PnP) considered only a single image input in the whole pipeline.
Training Scheme. During the initial implicit neural representation (INR) pre-training phase, Gaussian noise
with a standard deviation in the range of [0.001,0.5]was explored with 0.1was set for all the experiments.
The training was conducted over 100iterations, with a network configuration comprising 2hidden layers and
64features per layer. The learning rate was set to 0.001. We then reconstruct the image for 5 ADMM iteration
steps with dynamic noise strength and penalty parameter chosen by logarithmic descent that gradually
decreases value between 35 and 30 over steps.
Evaluation Protocol. For comparative analysis, the Noise2Self pre-training scheme (Krull et al., 2019),
was applied to three networks, each undergoes 100training iterations with a learning rate of 0.01. The

results, as detailed in Table 1, reveal our method’s outstanding performance, outshining the benchmarks
with significant margins. Notably, our approach demonstrates a marked improvement in PSNR values, with
particularly pronounced enhancements in the 4x upscaling scenario. These advancements indicate our model’s
robustness and substantial improvement forward in Single-Shot super resolution.
Our method demonstrates exceptional preservation of texture and detail complexity, as shown in Figures 2, 3.
Our technique achieves high-resolution enhancement while intricately reconstructing fine details, evident from
the minimised artifacts such as grid patterns and spurious spots in Figure 2. In Figure 3, DnCNN introduces
noticeable colour distortions in both the background and the foreground. The UNet generates numerous
undesirable grids. Although our approach presents a comparable visual quality to FFDNet, it achieves a
superior PSNR, suggesting a quantitatively and qualitatively improved performance. Collectively, our results
indicate that our method not only holds promise for practical application but also sets a new standard for
super-resolution tasks.

The comparison is made across different denoising priors in Play-and-Play framworks, inclusing Single-Shot
deep denoising priors (our proposed prior– ★, Noise2Self-UNET, and Noise2Self-FFDNet), pre-trained deep
denoising priors (Pretrained-UNet and Pretrained-FFDNet), and classical denoising priors (TV).
/hand-p⌢int-rightImage Deconvolution. This is a computational technique aimed at reversing the effects of blur on
photographs. Mathematically, the observed image, y, is the result of convoluing the true image, x, with a
forward measurement operator: A(x)=k⊗x. The goal of deconvolution is to estimate the original image x
by deconvoluting the observed image ywith the gaussian kernel k. Here, the kernel size was set as 15 with
standard deviation 5 of Gaussian distribution.
The performance comparison of various Single-Shot deep denoiser algorithms on a deconvolution task, shown
in Table 2, evaluated using both PSNR and SSIM metrics as well. The comparison includes our method
alongside established techniques like DnCNN, FFDNet, and UNet across other six image categories. Our
approach consistently achieves competitive PSNR scores, surpassing others in the ‘Turtle’ and ‘Monarch’
categories, and still shows parity improvements in SSIM values. This indicates not only enhanced accuracy in
image reconstruction but also improved perceptual quality. These results underscore our method’s effectiveness
in noise reduction and sharpness, demonstrating its potential for practical deconvolution applications.
In Figure 4, we illustrate a qualitative comparison of our deconvolution algorithm on a ‘Giraffe’ image against
four leading Single-Shot deep denoising priors. The visual fidelity of our method is apparent, particularly in
its capacity to reconstruct intricate details, such as the giraffe’s fur that reflected in the zoomed views. This
attention to detail extends to the preservation of edge sharpness and the subtle gradations, which contribute
to a more natural and cohesive image composition. Contrastingly, other methods exhibit varying degrees of
blurring and artifact introduction. This qualitative advancement underscores our algorithm’s potential to set
a remarkable benchmark for image deconvolution.

/hand-p⌢int-rightJoint Demosaicing and Deconvolution. Demosaicing is an algorithmic process that reconstructs a
full-colour image from the incomplete colour samples output by an image sensor overlaid with a colour filter
array (CFA).
The joint demosaicing and deconvolutional process can be represented as: A(x)=k⊗(M⊙x), wherexis the
full-colour image, Mis the colour filter array (CFA) , ⊙denotes element-wise multiplication. The setting of
kwas same with kernel in deconvolution task.
Based on performances from previous tasks, we note that FFDNet and UNet produce good results. In the
more challenging tasks as it is joint demosaicing and deconvolution, these methods, along with classical Total
Variation (TV) (Jordan, 1881), are further compared with the data-driven pre-trained denoising priors, and
Single-Shot denoising priors training under Noise2Self strategy against our proposed method.
Table 3 illustrates that our method outperforms all methods across all categories, achieving the highest PSNR
and SSIM scores in most cases. Notably, in the ‘Wolf’ and ‘Monarch’ categories, our method significantly
leads, reflecting a substantial improvement in both reconstruction accuracy and image quality, as indicated
by the PSNR and SSIM metrics respectively. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in handling
complex image restoration tasks.
InFigure5and6, ourmethodoutperformsotherestablishedalgorithmsinjointdeconvolutionanddemosaicing,
particularly in mitigating chromatic aberrations such as red grids or spots. These artifacts, which degrade
image quality, are significantly reduced in our approach, leading to a visually coherent result that aligns more
closely with the ground truth. Competing methods, including pre-trained networks and classical denoising
techniques, often introduce or inadequately suppress such distortions, resulting in inferior colour and contrasts
outcomes. Our method advances the visual quality of image restoration, effectively preserving the natural
colour and detail fidelity.

We also present a visualisation comparing the error maps of our proposed prior with other denoising priors
within the Plug-and-Play framework in Figure 7. While there are some noticeable visual differences, the
distribution of errors across the image suggests that many discrepancies are not easily detectable by the
human eye. However, our method demonstrates a significant numerical improvement over the alternatives,
despite these subtle visual distinctions.

We follow the same experimental settings
as described in 4.1, and measure the per-
formance based on Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR). In Table 4, our proposed
INR outperforms SIREN in all the 4 tasks:
deconvolution, super resolution 2×and
4×, and joint deconvolution and demo-
saicing. This performance is significant
in the super resolution with an average
improvement of 0.8dB. The spatial com-

maps of ★and SIREN are provided in the third row.
The plot indicates the performance (PSNR) with both
implicit neural priors changing over the ADMM itera-
tion on the joint deconvolution and demosaicing task.We can observe from Figure 8 that our INR excels in
reconstructingtheimagewithsmootheredgefeatures
and enhanced colour representation. The difference
is more clearly reflected in the error maps, with a
noticeable variation around the edge features across
all four tasks. The performance over iteration curves
demonstrate our leading advances over the optimi-
sation iterations, meanwhile show the early iteration
steps is effective for achieving the best performance.
This is commonly observed in iterative optimisation
techniques (Wei et al., 2020; 2022), where initial
iterations tend to improve the quality of the recon-
struction, while beyond a certain point, the model
begin to introduce artifacts or oversmooth the image,
which leads to a degradation in performance and
consequently a drop in PSNR.
We also conducted a comparative analysis of our
proposed Single-Shot prior against other state-of-
the-art priors within Plug-and-Play frameworks, as
shown in Figure 5. The BM3D (Dabov et al., 2007)
and DIP (Sun et al., 2021b) priors were each run for
240 iterations—ten times the iterations used for our
Single-Shotapproach. Despitethis, theclassicBM3D
method’s performance was markedly lower compared
to both DIP and our method. While the DIP prior
within the Plug-and-Play framework demonstrated
results closer to ours, a significant performance gap
remains, underscoring the superior efficacy of our
approach in both 2×and4×super-resolution tasks.
5 Conclusion
Our work pioneers the Single-Shot Plug-and-Play (SS-PnP) method, transforming the use of PnP priors
in inverse problem-solving by reducing reliance on large-scale pre-training of denoisers, and using a single
instance. We also propose Single-Shot proximal denoisers via implicit neural priors allowing for superior
approximation quality for solving inverse problems using only a single instance. We propose a novel function
for implicit neural priors that has desirable theoretical guarantees. We also showed that our work generalises
well across different tasks, showing empirical stability for single and multiple operators. We then open the door
to a new research line for Single-Shot PnP. Whilst this work uses mainly PnP-ADMM due to the well-know
properties, and performance in comparison with other algorithms. Future work will include to evaluate our
new research line on Single-Shot PnP on different algorithms including but not limited to FISTA (Beck &
Teboulle, 2009a), HQS (Geman & Yang, 1995), and Primal-dual (Dantzig et al., 1956) algorithms. Another
additional side insight could be to explore the result over randomising z0in step 2 of Algorithm 1. Though
the primary focus of this work is not the convergence of the proposed implicit neural prior, the convergence
of the broader PnP framework is a significant and intricate topic that is valuable to analysis in the future
research work.
