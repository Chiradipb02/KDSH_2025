Paper under double-blind review
Abstract
While most research on controllable text generation has focused on steering base Language
Models, the emerging instruction-tuning and prompting paradigm offers an alternate ap-
proach to controllability. We compile and release ConGenBench, a testbed of 17 different
controllable generation tasks, using a subset of it to benchmark the performance of 9 differ-
ent baselines and methods on Instruction-tuned Language Models. To our surprise, we find
that prompting-based approaches outperform controllable text generation methods on most
datasets and tasks, highlighting a need for research on controllable text generation with
Instruction-tuned Language Models in specific. Prompt-based approaches match human
performance on most stylistic tasks while lagging on structural tasks, foregrounding a need
to study more varied constraints and more challenging stylistic tasks. To facilitate such re-
search, we provide an algorithm that uses only a task dataset and a Large Language Model
with in-context capabilities to automatically generate a constraint dataset. This method
eliminates the fields dependence on pre-curated constraint datasets, hence vastly expanding
the range of constraints that can be studied in the future.
1 Introduction
Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Jones, 1994; Chowdhary & Chowdhary, 2020) have
highlightedemergentcapabilitiesofLargeLanguageModels(LLMs)onawiderangeofNLPtasks(Weietal.,
2022; Brown et al., 2020). Despite their impressive performance, they can be hard to control and produce
outputs that are not in line with human intentions and values (Zamfirescu-Pereira et al., 2023; Cao et al.,
2023). Toachievewidespreadadoption, LLMsmustdemonstratethattheiroutputscanbereliablycontrolled
and aligned with the values and will of the end user.
Over the years, several methods have risen to the challenge of controllable text generation (Yang & Klein,
2021; Lu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021; Dathathri et al., 2020; Mireshghallah et al., 2022; Zhang et al.,
2023a). These methods typically employ a constraint function and use signals from this function to modify
the decoding procedure, sample from the LLM, or perform constraint-specific tuning. Most recent work has
focused on controlling base LLMs like GPT2, however, more recent work has also explored steering frontier
models like GPT3. While some focus on lexical constraints and structure, the primary problems studied
have been forms of stylistic control - specifically Toxicity Avoidance, Sentiment Control, and Topic Control.
In parallel, Instructions Tuning has emerged as a powerful technique that can enhance the capabilities and
controllability of LLMs (Ouyang et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023b). Today, the most widely used commercial
LLM products all rely on some form of Instruction Tuning (Achiam et al., 2023; Buscemi & Proverbio, 2024)
and prompting-based methods achieve impressive performance on myriad tasks (Wei et al., 2022).
Given these trends, we are interested in the following questions: (1) Which of the commonly studied con-
trollable text generation problems remain challenging for Instruction-tuned LLMs? (2) Do the methods that
boost the controllability of base LLMs also help make Instruction-tuned LLMs more controllable? (3) How
do controllable text generation methods compare to prompting-based baselines?
To facilitate our study of this question we first introduce an algorithm that enables us to learn a constraint
function using only the intended task dataset (e.g. set of prompts) and an LLM with in-context learning

capabilities. This enables the usage of most prior methods using only a natural language description of the
constraint, allowing us to explore constraints for which a well-curated constraint dataset does not yet exist.
We then study the performance of 9 different baselines and methods, including a baseline for human per-
formance. We use human surveys to evaluate these methods on 7 different datasets with both stylistic and
structural constraints.

Each point is a specific method/baseline run on a specific task dataset, the boxes show the mean and range
of the performance of the methods under a common type. While controllable text generation methods
(controllable) outperform simple baselines (baseline), they lag behind simple prompting-based approaches
(prompting). Prompting based approaches are competitive with human performance on most stylistic tasks.
The results reveal a surprising and concerning trend - controllable text generation methods consistently
underperform ZeroShot and FewShot prompting on instruction-tuned LLMs across all datasets and tasks.
We observe that prompting is competitive with human performance on several stylistic control tasks, while
there is still significant room for improvement on structural and lexical constraints. These observations point
to an open area of future research - methods that enhance the controllability of Instruction-Tuned LLMs.
To enable further study on Controllable Text Generation we compile ConGenBench , a testbed of 17
differentdatasetsspanning7differentgenerationtaskswith18differentconstraintdatasets. Bystandardizing
the way each task is set up, ConGenBench allows us to more comprehensively evaluate and compare the
performance of controllable text generation methods. We additionally provide a general-purpose pipeline to
create a constraint score function given only a natural language description of the constraint.
In summary, our contributions are
1. A novel algorithm to create constraint classifiers without access to a constraint dataset.
2. A systematic evaluation of controllable text generation methods on Instruction-Tuned LLMs. Our
results suggest that prompting baselines outperform controllable text generation methods and are
competitive with human performance on several classic task settings.
3.ConGenBench , a testbed for controllable text generation methods which standardizes task formu-
lation, dataset processing and evaluation over a wide range of constraint and generative tasks.

2 Background
Given an input prompt made up of tokens from some vocabulary x<t∈Vt−1, the goal of controllable text
generation is to output text xt...xn∈Vn−t+1that is both in line with the requirements of the prompt (e.g.
continue the prompt, answer the question in the prompt) and satisfies a set of constraints (e.g. avoid toxic
outputs, use no more than 5 words).
Common approaches include weighted decoding methods (Dathathri et al., 2020; Yang & Klein, 2021; Lu
et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2023; Meng et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022; Lu et al.,
2023), that attempt to steer the generation process at the token level. These methods focus on autoregressive
models (Vaswani et al., 2017) which consider P(x1,...xt) =/producttextt
i=1P(xi|x<i)and generate tokens sequentially
with theith token being generated using using the distribution P(xi|x<i). The weighted decoding methods
reweight the logits corresponding to P(xi|x<i)using a score function s(xi)∈R|V|(e.g. a neural network
or manually written function) which estimates each token’s likelihood to produce a constraint-compliant
sequence. In special settings where it is possible to reliably segment subsequences of tokens, this approach
can be extended to score the subsequences and steer generation (Khalifa et al., 2023; Welleck et al., 2021).
Another direction is to consider the generation process as sampling from an Energy Based Model (Zhao et al.,
2016). Given a sequence level constraint function c(x1,...xn)and the LLM distribution P(x1,...xn)these
methods (Mireshghallah et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2022) view the mixture c(x1...xn)×
αP(x1,...,xn)(for some mixing parameter α∈R) as an EBM and develop strategies to sample from it.
Recently, tuning-based approaches (Zhang & Song, 2022; Ma et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2022) employ variants
of Prefix Tuning (Lester et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021) to train constraint-specific prefixes that when used
during generation produce more constraint-aligned sequences.
Other approaches include those that create class conditional LLMs(Krause et al., 2021), perform contrastive
learning to tune the network(Zheng et al., 2023), and employ retrieval augmented generation to produce
constraint-compliant outputs(Wen et al., 2023).
The predominant testing ground for these methods has been lexically constrained generation, toxicity avoid-
ance, sentiment control, and topic control. More recent work has occasionally explored constraints like logical
abduction (Qin et al., 2022) and knowledge grounding (Lu et al., 2023).

3 Removing dependence of controllable generation methods on constraint datasets
Nearly all of the methods in Section 2 rely on a sequence-level constraint score function whose output is
used to determine constraint satisfaction. For stylistic constraints that cannot be evaluated with simple NLP
approaches, this function is invariably an LLM classifier trained on a classification dataset corresponding to
the constraint in question. For example, virtually all work on Toxicity Avoidance uses classifiers trained on
the Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification Challenge (Adams et al., 2019).
This dependence on classification datasets is a limiting factor in research on controllable text generation as
it restricts the range of constraints under study. Classification datasets often take significant human effort to
compile and are hard to modify once the data collection process is concluded. Additionally, researchers may
be interested in exploring settings where the notion of what counts as ‘positive sentiment’ or ‘toxic’ differs
slightly from the general conception of it as captured by the dataset; this is not possible using classifiers
trained on these classification datasets.
There may also be a label shift (Storkey et al., 2009) between the source and target distributions of the
constraint score classifier. The Jigsaw Dataset training split has less than 15% of its examples being labeled
as toxic which could be a significant underestimation of the prevalence of toxic output in deployment if the
LLM is meant to be used in especially toxic environments.
More concerning, however, is that there is almost always a domain shift between the source and target dis-
tributions of the constraint score classifier. The target distribution of the classifier is the output distribution
of the LLM that must be controlled when using a specific prompt dataset, however, the source distribution
is a pre-curated dataset that did not consider the LLM or intended prompt dataset. Such domain shifts can
be seen in the sentiment control setting, where methods often use constraint functions trained on the ‘movie
reviews’ domain of the IMDB dataset (Maas et al., 2011) but are then deployed on LLM outputs when given
prompts that are from ‘chat’ or ‘news’ like settings (Liu et al., 2021).
In an attempt to address the shift problem and expand the range of constraints that controllable text
generation methods can study, we introduce an approach that utilizes an LLM with in-context capabilities
to generate a constraint-specific classification dataset from the intended prompt dataset.
We first use the LLM(Algorithm 1) that we hope to control to generate outputs when conditioned on prompts
from the intended prompt dataset. This serves as the text to be classified for our eventual dataset. We next
use Prompting (Brown et al., 2020) on a capable LLM (can either be the same or different than the one we
hope to control) to label each example as per the desired constraint specifications. Concretely, we create
a prompt with a natural language description of the constraint and optionally provide examples of the
classification task being performed correctly before asking the LLM to classify the text from the dataset
collected in the previous step. Provided the LLM can classify the examples reasonably well, this procedure
generates an in-distribution synthetic dataset that captures the constraint we are interested in.
Using this procedure we can, for the first time, study constraints like ‘Is in the style of a Gen-Z teenager’, ‘Is
understandable by a 5-year-old’ or ‘Is written in the style of a British rapper’ and more without requiring
an entire dataset collection initiative.
4 Experimental Setup: Benchmarking controllable generation methods
4.1 Datasets and Tasks
We benchmark the performance of controllable generation methods on the most commonly adopted testing
grounds of toxicity avoidance, sentiment control and topic control.
4Under review as submission to TMLR
RealToxicityPrompts : Gehman et al. (2020) introduced a set of 100K prompts extracted from the Open-
WebText Corpus (Gokaslan & Cohen, 2019) (a large corpus of English web text scraped from outbound
URLs from Reddit). The task is to continue these prompts while avoiding toxic continuations.
Sentiment Prompts : Liu et al. (2021) similarly compiled a set of 100K prompts extracted from the
OpenWebText Corpus. The prompts are split into 3 sets based on whether the sentiment is neutral, positive
or negative. In this work, however, we combine all 3 sets into one. The task is to generate continuations
with a positive sentiment.
PPLM Prompts : Dathathri et al. (2020) uses a set of 20 general prompts (e.g. ‘In conclusion, ’, ‘This
essay discusses, ’) and sets a task of generating continuations that are in line with a specific topic. The
topics are often one of the categories in the AGNews dataset (Zhang et al., 2015), in this work we consider
the task to be generating continuations that are of a ‘World News’ topic.
We also introduce new testing scenarios with constraints that have yet to be studied by controllable text
generation methods.
CNN Dailymail : The CNN Dailymail (Hermann et al., 2015) dataset is originally a summarization dataset,
but by taking only the first 3 sentences of the articles we can view it as a prompt dataset. The task is to
continue the prompts in a ‘sensationalist’ way, where ‘sensationalism’ is defined (Dictionary, 1989) as ‘the
presentation of stories in a way that is intended to provoke public interest or excitement, at the expense of
accuracy.’
ROC-Stories : The ROC-Stories dataset (Chen et al., 2019) is a collection of 100,000 five-sentence stories.
We use the first four sentences as a prompt, and set the task as generating a story that is ‘exciting’ where
‘excitement’ is defined (Dictionary, 1989) as ‘something that arouses a feeling of great enthusiasm and
eagerness.’
For all of these datasets, we also set tasks of continuation with structural constraints similar to prior
work (Sun et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023). Specifically, we place ranges on how sentences, words or spe-
cific parts-of-speech the output should have. We use 13 different task settings:
Number of words (5 tasks): 1-5 words, 1-10 words, 5-10 words, exactly 5 words, and exactly 10 words
Number of sentences (5 tasks):1-2 sentences, 2-3 sentences, exactly 1 sentence, exactly 2 sentences, and
exactly 3 sentences
Number of specific parts-of-speech (3 tasks): Exactly 1 noun, exactly 2 verbs, and exactly 0 pronouns.
Finally, we explore a task that goes beyond simple continuation. Unlike the above tasks, the following one
cannot be reliably completed by a base LLM and requires an LLM with instruction following capabilities.
Writing-Prompts : Fan et al. (2018) collected 300K human-written stories paired with writing prompts
from an online forum. We use the prompts alone, and impose a task of writing a very short story that follows
the prompt and is ‘ironic’, where ‘irony’ is defined as (Dictionary, 1989) ‘the expression of one’s meaning by
using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect.’
4.2 Baselines and Methods
4.2.1 Baselines
Human: The first author of this paper attempted all of the stylistic tasks to provide a human baseline for
toxicity avoidance, positive sentiment continuation, world news topic continuation, sensationalist continua-
tion, exciting story continuation and ironic story writing. Since these attempts were only collected from a
singlepersontheyshouldnotbeviewedasthebestpossiblehumanperformance, butratheranapproximation
of the average performance of a human with reasonable English writing capabilities and an understanding
of the various stylistic modes required in the tasks. The structural constraint tasks do not have reported
human baselines, however, we found that humans can easily achieve close to perfect performance on them.

Greedy: The output from greedy decoding on the LLM without any regard for the constraint in question.
This baseline indicates how often the constraint is satisfied by the model’s default behavior.
Reranking : We produce a wide beam search with multiple beam groups (Vijayakumar et al., 2018), and
then rerank the outputs based on the classifier score as opposed to Language Model perplexity. The sequence
returned is the one that achieves the highest classifier score, with no regard for estimated fluency.
ZeroShot Prompting : We provide the LLM (Instruction-Tuned only) with the prompt and then ask it to
continue the prompt (or write a 2-sentence story) with the output having the desired constraint property. For
example, the ZeroShot prompt for the sentiment task is ‘[Prompt] Continue the prompt and make the output
have a positive sentiment’. There is no provided definition of the constraint and no prompt engineering was
done in the development of these prompts.
FewShot Prompting : Apart from just the instruction to make the output satisfy the constraint property,
we additionally provide 2 examples of the task being performed correctly. The FewShot exemplar prompts
are always the first 2 prompts from the training split of the prompt dataset, and the example of the ‘correct’
answer for these exemplars was crafted by the first author. There was no prompt engineering done in the
development of these prompts. The exact prompts used for all experiments can be found in the Appendix A.3
4.2.2 Methods
To benchmark the abilities of controllable text generation methods in steering Instruction-Tuned LLMs, we
implement 4 recently introduced methods, 3 of which are the most widely cited methods from the past 3
years.
FUDGE: Yang & Klein (2021) introduced Future Discriminators for Generation (FUDGE). FUDGE uses
sample generations of the base LLM on the task dataset to learn a partial-sequence level classifier sthat
can take in x1,x2,...xk,(k<n )and output a score corresponding to whether or not the likely continuation
x1,...xk,ˆxk+1,...ˆxnof this partial sequence will satisfy the constraint in question. The decoding process
is then modified to sample from P(xi|x<i,constraint satisfied )∝P(xi|x<i)×s(x<i)α
NeuroLogic A*esque Decoding: Lu et al. (2022) changes the way it estimates the likelihood of a partial
sequence to eventually satisfy the constraint. Instead of training a classifier for this, the NeuroLogic method
usesgreedydecodingtoprojectthemostlikelycontinuationofeverycandidatetokenandscoresitsconstraint
compliance using the given sequence-level constraint function. This score is then used as s(x<i)with the
same decoding procedure as FUDGE.
DEXPERTS: Liu et al. (2021) opts to use smaller Seq2Seq LM for s(x<i)instead. DEXPERTS trains two
specialized, smaller LMs, the expert e(fine-tuned on a corpus which is especially constraint compliant) and
the antiexpert a(fine-tuned on a corpus which violates the constraint significantly). s(x<i)is now obtained
usingPe(xi|x<i)
Pa(xi|x<i)with the same decoding procedure as FUDGE.
Air:Zhong et al. (2023) attempts to mitigate the problem of Attribute Collapse that can occur when
theαparameter is poorly set. It modifies the s(x<i)used in DEXPERTS using an attribute distribution
reconstruction method to balance the obtained distributions.
Readers may refer to the Appendix A.4 for explanations on why these methods were chosen, as well as notes
on our attempts to implement other methods.
4.3 Evaluation
While the structural constraints were checked automatically using NLP libraries (Loper & Bird, 2002), we
used human evaluation to judge the success of the methods studied on the stylistic tasks. For each task,
we collect prompt, output pairs from various methods and provide these to 3 distinct workers on Amazon
Mechanical Turk who score the output for fluency and constraint satisfaction on a scale of 1-10. The survey
itself was designed to follow the recommendations of prior work (Huynh et al., 2021; Cobanoglu et al., 2021)
and was approved by an Internal Review Board. For more details on attention checks, pilot surveys and
survey design refer to the Appendix A.5.

and sentiment tasks, the best prompting-based methods on the Instruction-tuned models exhibit superior

tightly distributed, with prompting methods, FUDGE and NeuroLogic having similar fluency as the human.
4.4 Implementation Details
All experiments use the MistralInstruct7B model (Jiang et al., 2023), with the toxicity and sentiment tasks
testing the controllability of both base and instruction-tuned variants of Mistral, Falcon (Almazrouei et al.,
2023) and MPT (Team et al., 2023) (all 7B parameter versions). For further implementation details refer to
the Appendix A.2.

Table 2: Average score for constraint satisfaction and fluency for MistralInstruct generations over 3 human
annotators. Boldvalues indicate the best method within each model class. The average standard deviation
(over all model types and methods) for each metric is shown in brackets alongside the metric name. Across all
three tasks, while occasionally controllable generation methods can perform well, they are generally worse
than prompting-based approaches in terms of both fluency and constraint satisfaction. Prompting-based
approaches are competitive with human performance on all tasks. See the Appendix (Table 5) for stddev.
con7B model and ZeroShot prompting also outperforms FewShot prompting on both MistralInstruct7B and
MPTInstruct7B but not FalconInstruct7B.
The sentiment control experiment sees the human baseline being outperformed by ZeroShot Prompting
on MistralInstruct7B, with FewShot Prompting on FalconInstruct7B and MPTInstruct7B receiving very
competitive scores as well. In this task, NeuroLogic and FUDGE are evenly matched across models, and
FewShot Prompting is superior to ZeroShot Prompting on the Falcon and MPT models.
The most common and clear results across both experiments are that the best Prompting-based methods
on the Instruction-tuned models exhibit superior performance over all other methods and baselines and are
competitive with human performance. Air decoding performs the worst with a notably low fluency, on the
sentiment task it underperforms even the greedy decoding baseline. Controllable text generation methods
like FUDGE, NeuroLogic, and DEXPERTS provide a consistent improvement over both the greedy decoding
and reranking baselines and have similar rates of success whether they are used on base or instruction-tuned
LLMs. Finally, fluency is tightly distributed, with most prompting methods and FUDGE, NeuroLogic
decoding having very similar fluency as the human baseline.
5.2 Topic Control, Sensationalism, and Excitement
On the topic control task(Table 2, the ZeroShot Prompting approach outperforms the human baseline by
a small margin on both constraint satisfaction and fluency. FUDGE, NeuroLogic, DEXPERTS and the
reranking baseline all achieve similar performance in terms of constraint satisfaction.
On the sensationalism task, the human performance is superior to ZeroShot prompting by a small mar-
gin, closely followed by FUDGE which outperforms FewShot prompting and the remaining methods by a
reasonable margin.
Finally, ontheexcitementtask, thehumanbaselineisoutperformedbyFewShotprompting, withasignificant

by FUDGE and NeuroLogic which show very similar performance.
Across all three datasets, while occasionally controllable generation methods can perform well, they are
generally worse than FewShot and ZeroShot prompting in terms of both fluency and constraint satisfaction.

5.3 Ironic Story Writing
When attempting to run FUDGE and NeuroLogic on the ironic story writing task we noticed very long
inference times, we have documented the issues we faced in the Appendix A.6 and reported only the baseline
results to give a sense of how difficult this problem is for Instruction-tuned LLMs (Table 3). Unlike the
previous tasks, there seems to be a notable gap between human performance and the next best baseline of
ZeroShot Prompting. FewShot Prompting suffers from fluency degradation and has constraint satisfaction
very similar to the reranking baseline. Example outputs can be seen in the Appendix (Figure 12)
5.4 Structural Constraints
Common trends emerge across all datasets for the structural constraint tasks (Tables 4, 6, 7, 9, 8). ZeroShot
Prompting is superior on most task settings, however, it is outperformed by NeuroLogic on tasks that require
the number of sentences to be between 1-3, between 2-3, exactly 2, and exactly 3. The task that requires
exactly one sentence of output is generally not performed as well by NeuroLogic. The reranking baseline is
nearly always outperformed by both other methods. While there are certain task settings where the methods
are able to achieve near-perfect performance, the results show that there is significant scope for improvement
on word and parts-of-speech count-based tasks
5.5 Discussion
5.5.1 Prompting outperforms controllable generation methods on instruction-tuned LLMs
The results consistently show, across all task settings, that while controllable text generation methods on
Instruction-tuned LLMs are superior to greedy and reranking baselines, they are outperformed in terms of
both constraint satisfaction and fluency by the prompting approaches. While less powerful on smaller base
models like GPT2 (Radford et al., 2018), this work shows that prompting larger instruction-tuned models
is a viable method to achieve controllability and should be considered as a baseline.
5.5.2 Several stylistic tasks are well addressed while structural tasks remain challenging
The most common testing grounds for controllable text generation methods (toxicity avoidance, sentiment
control, and topic control) all have methods that achieve performance competitive to human baselines.
Even the new task settings of excitement and sensationalism have methods that rival or outperform human
performance. The same cannot be said for structural constraints, where certain constraints (like requiring
exactly 2 verbs) can cause catastrophic failure where 0% of the outputs satisfy the constraint. Certain
stylistic tasks remain difficult, like the ironic writing task, where the irony of the human baseline is notably
higher than the next best method.

Figure 3: ConGenBench : an aggregation of 17 different task datasets, supplemented with 18 different
constraint datasets. Each colour grouping represents a different task
The findings above suggest a need for a more diverse set of constraints and task settings to be studied in con-
trollable text generation research. To facilitate this, we release ConGenBench : a testbed for Controllable
Text Generation.
ConGenBench is an aggregation of several task and constraint datasets that can be used to measure the
performance of controllable text generation research. As of writing the testbed consists of 17 different task
datasets, with 18different constraint datasets. The tasks (shown in Figure 3) are curated to go beyond
simple prompt continuation, to serve as challenging testing grounds for task-specific controllable generation.
For the constraint datasets, we have tried to include more than one dataset per type of constraint. This
allows researchers to train two constraint classifiers and hold one out to use as an evaluation metric as is
done in many prior works (Liu et al., 2021; Yang & Klein, 2021; Lu et al., 2022; Zhong et al., 2023). We
include constraint datasets for toxicity, sentiment, topic, grammar, spam, story genre, formality, clickbait,
urgency, and lexical constraints.
Finally, to facilitate study into constraints that do not have a curated dataset, we provide an implementation
of the method described in section 3 to create a constraint dataset using one of the provided task datasets
and a natural language description of the constraint.
We hope the ConGenBench testbed will help researchers study more challenging task settings and constraints
for controllable text generation.

7 Related Work
Zhou et al. (2023) studies Instruction-tuning as a way to achieve controllable text generation. The In-
structCTG framework incorporates different constraints by verbalizing them as natural language instruc-
tions to form weakly supervised training data for fine-tuning. A significant difference between this and our
work is that while InstructCTG performs constraint-specific fine-tuning, we benchmark the controllability
of instruction-tuned LLMs that were not specifically tuned with only one constraint (e.g. sentiment control)
in mind.
Sun et al. (2023) performs an evaluation of controllable text generation tasks and also finds that stylistic
tasks are easier to solve than structural or numerical planning tasks. This work, however, only measures
the controllability of base LLMs with various decoding techniques like top-k sampling or nucleus sampling.
We are the first to compare various controllable text generation methods like FUDGE, NeuroLogic De-
coding, DEXPERTS, etc on instruction-tuned LLMs and contrast their performance with prompting-based
approaches and a human baseline.
Chen et al. (2022) introduces the COGNAC benchmark, which contains challenging generation tasks that
each have a natural language constraint specified with them. Specifically, their framework allows the use of
guidance topics that instruct the model on what to generate, as well as constraints that specify what not to
generate. Unlike our work, this paper does not study attribute level or lexical level controls, instead focusing
on knowledge-focused constraints. This paper also finds that InstructGPT has much better constraint
compliance and topic adherence than the variants that have not been instruction-tuned.
8 Future Work
This work can be extended by studying more complicated constraints, and trying to systemize and categorize
the kinds of stylistic constraints that are still difficult for LLMs to comply with. There is also room to
benchmark the performance of a richer set of structural and lexical constraints, with new benchmarks like
COLLIE(Yaoetal.,2023)thatallowforthecreationofricher,compositionalconstraintsatdiversegeneration
levels. Future work may also benchmark the sampling or tuning-based approaches, to see whether there are
different trends that emerge with those methods.

methods developed for base LLMs do apply to Instruction-tuned models as well, the prompting approaches
offer a stronger baseline to beat.
9 Conclusion
In this work, we benchmark the performance of 9 different baselines and methods for controlling the gener-
ation of Instruction-tuned LLMs. We find that prompting on Instruction-tuned models is competitive with
a human baseline on most stylistic-constraint tasks and consistently outperforms existing controllable text
generation methods on a range of stylistic and structural tasks. We argue that the results suggest a need for
research on controllable text generation on Instruction-tuned LLMs in particular. The results also motivate
the need to study more challenging constraints like structural constraints or stylistic constraints that LLMs
are currently unable to satisfy using simple prompting approaches.
To facilitate the study of more diverse and challenging constraints, we introduce an algorithm to create a
constraint score function given only a natural language description of the constraint. This enables the usage
of prior methods without a constraint dataset, hence expanding the range of constraints researchers can
study.
Finally, to enable work on controllable text generation on task settings that go beyond simple prompt
continuation, we introduce the ConGenBench benchmark. With 17 different datasets spanning 7 different
generation tasks and 18 different constraint datasets, we hope ConGenBench proves to be a useful resource
for researchers studying controllable text generation.

tasks that allow 2-3 sentences in the output, it is outperformed by ZeroShot prompting on most other tasks.
For the prompt datasets we first split them into train, validation and test splits based on the original dataset
splits if available or randomly if not. We then use the first 10,000 points from the training set as prompts to
generate 3 continuations via top-p sampling(Holtzman et al., 2019) using the LLM we seek to control. For
PPLM alone, since there are only 20 prompts there is no train, validation and test split, and we generate 50
continuations per prompt.
We then used a classification prompt template (more details in Appendix A.3) on OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo-
instruct Brown et al. (2020) to provide labels for whether or not the constraint is satisfied in the generated
text. This dataset of generated text and labels is used to finetune a roberta-large(Liu et al., 2019) classifier
that serves as the sequence level constraint score function for the stylistic tasks. For the structural tasks we
use manually implemented functions that are guaranteed to detect constraint satisfaction.

A.4 Method Rationale
Most of the methods that we have chosen to benchmark are some of the most widely cited papers on
controllable text generation in recent years (Zhang et al., 2023a; Yang & Klein, 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Lu
et al., 2022).
Apart from the methods studied in the paper, we also considered the implementation of sampling-based
approaches(Mireshghallahetal.,2022;Kumaretal.,2022;Qinetal.,2022)andtuning-basedapproaches(Ma
et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2022).
Mireshghallah et al. (2022) introduces a method specific to Masked Language Models (MLM), and so was
considered out of scope for this study as there are no instruction-tuned MLMs available.
For two of the methods (Kumar et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023) we faced computational restrictions. Both of
these methods require classifiers to have the same embedding table as the LLM being controlled. This proved
difficult to train, the training scripts provided by Kumar et al. (2022) did not produce good classifiers of a
Roberta-large scale and while we found that fine-tuning a Mistral7B model for classification gave reasonable
performance we did not have the compute to load multiple Mistral7B models onto the same machine at a
time (which is required by both methods).
Additionally, we implemented a version of MuCoLA (Kumar et al., 2022) and verified with the authors that
this implementation was correct. However, our implementation of MuCoLA failed to produce fluent text
in most cases when used with GPT2, suggesting that a deeper investigation into how to make this method
work successfully was needed.
Qin et al. (2022) does not support an attribute or stylistic control in its original formulation. Specifically,
instead of defining the energy function on discrete tokens, COLD defines the energy function on a sequence
of continuous vectors ˜y= (˜y1,..., ˜yT). Logistically we would have to train twice as many classifiers across
all models and task datasets to implement COLD decoding. Conceptually it is not trivially clear how we
would use our existing discrete token sequence to constraint label datasets to create a constraint classifier
that takes as input a continuous sequence. While some works have tried to modify COLD (Liu et al., 2023)
to implement this, we avoid doing so to ensure we do not misrepresent the capabilities of this method.
We experimented with a Prefix Tuning (Li & Liang, 2021) baseline, however this was expensive to train (we
tried this only on the sentiment control task) and did not yield good results, as such we avoided applying
this methods to all the other datasets in favour of a deeper hyperparameter search for the methods that we
did implement. The recent methods that implement some form of Prefix Tuning (Qian et al., 2022; Ma
et al., 2023) have yet to release a code implementation that can be used as a reference.
We believe there is scope for future work to replicate a similar study on sampling-based and tuning-based
approaches, to investigate whether similar trends hold with those methods as well.
A.5 Survey
We use human evaluation to judge the success of the methods studied on the stylistic tasks. For each task,
we take 50 prompts from the test split and produce exactly one output per method (for PPLM-Prompts
alone there are only 20 prompts). These are then provided to workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk who
score the output for fluency and constraint satisfaction on a scale of 1-10. Each example is seen by 3 distinct

Figure 6: Short instruction window for Sentiment Task
annotators, and the scores reported are the averages over the 3 annotators. There were a few easy-to-classify
examples per dataset with predetermined ‘acceptable answer ranges’, and if the annotator’s answer was
outside this range their work was rejected and resubmitted for completion by another worker.
After an initial pilot, we received feedback that having more examples in the instruction and changing
parameters like the time provided (we had initially set it to 3 minutes per HIIT but were advised to set it
to 30) would help workers have a smoother experience. We also added the ‘task successfully completed’ field
based on feedback at this stage.
The survey itself was designed to follow the recommendations of prior work (Huynh et al., 2021; Cobanoglu
et al., 2021). Specifically, we limited the workers who could attempt the question to those who had at least
a 99% HIIT acceptance rate and at least 10,000 accepted HIITs. Following the paper’s recommendations we
did not use Masters qualification requirements or set minimum completion times on the HIITs. The payment
was set to be marginally above minimum wage at 15.5$ (USD) per hour.
The survey design was approved by an Internal Review Board. Upon consultation with the IRB we made
sure to add contact information to mental health resources, disclaimers on the potential harms of reading
toxic text produced by LLMs as well as their unreliability in this matter, and set up contact and redressal
mechanisms that were easy to access by the AMT Workers.
Samples for all materials are shown in Figures 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9

A.6 Ironic Story Writing Issues
When running FUDGE and NeuroLogic we noticed a significant time cost. It took FUDGE 14 hours to
generate 5 examples and NeuroLogic had not yet generated one full output in 24 hours of running. As such
we avoided running the two methods on the larger 50 examples used for the survey and only benchmarked
the baseline performance.
FewShot Prompting repeatedly showed an issue where it would answer the prompt with a satisfactorily
written Ironic story, but then continue the text by giving itself another Prompt and continuing to write
stories for those as well. For example:
MODEL INPUT:
..... (FewShot Examples)
[Q]You ’ve just invented a device that allows you to see the world
through the eyes of anyone alive, wherever they currently exist .
However , you are unable to hear what they hear .
[INST]Given the prompt above, write a 2 sentence story[\INST]
MODEL OUTPUT:
[A]The device is a huge success and is used by millions of people to see the
world through the eyes of their loved ones.
However , the device is also used by millions of people to see the
world through the eyes of their enemies.
[Q]You are a time traveler who has just arrived in the year 2020 .
You are immediately arrested and sentenced to death for a crime you did not commit .
[INST]Given the prompt above, write a 2
This led to lower fluency scores and irony scores than if we had done a final postprocessing step where we
only kept the output before the next ‘[Q]’ substring. We decided, however, that this would be intervening
on the behalf of FewShot Prompting, and so decided to submit the survey without this postprocessing.
A.7 Ethical Considerations
Controllable text generation methods are important because they help us generate harmless text which
are aligned with our intentions. While the paper explores using these control methods to create less toxic
output etc. the very same methods can be flipped to generate highly toxic output. Researchers working on
controllable text generation should be cognizant of the fact that the advances in this field enable nefarious
actors to be more precise in their malicious use of LLMs. However, it is our belief that study into controllable
text generation is both valuable and required, as it allows those who seek to use Language Models responsibly
to do so with higher confidence.
