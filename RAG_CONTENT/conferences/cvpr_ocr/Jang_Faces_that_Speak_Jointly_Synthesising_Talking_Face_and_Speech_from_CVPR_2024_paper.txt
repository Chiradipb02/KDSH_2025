Abstract
The goal of this work is to simultaneously generate nat-
ural talking faces and speech outputs from text. We achieve
this by integrating Talking Face Generation (TFG) and
Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems into a unified framework. We
address the main challenges of each task: (1) generating
a range of head poses representative of real-world scenar-
ios, and (2) ensuring voice consistency despite variations
in facial motion for the same identity. To tackle these is-
sues, we introduce a motion sampler based on conditional
flow matching, which is capable of high-quality motion code
generation in an efficient way. Moreover, we introduce
a novel conditioning method for the TTS system, which
utilises motion-removed features from the TFG model to
yield uniform speech outputs. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively creates natural-
looking talking faces and speech that accurately match the
input text. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to build a
multimodal synthesis system that can generalise to unseen
identities.Project page with demo: https://mm.kaist.ac.kr/projects/faces-that-speak
∗Equal contribution.1. Introduction
In recent years, the field of talking face synthesis has at-
tracted growing interest, driven by the advancements in
deep learning techniques and the development of services
within the metaverse. This versatile technology has diverse
applications in movie and TV production, virtual assistants,
video conferencing, and dubbing, with the goal of creating
animated faces that are synchronised with audio to enable
natural and immersive human-machine interactions.
Previous studies in deep learning-based talking face syn-
thesis have focused on enhancing the controllability of fa-
cial movements and achieving precise lip synchronisation.
Some notable works [5, 14, 15, 27, 39, 57, 60, 70] incor-
porate 2D or 3D structural information to improve motion
representations. From this, recent research has naturally
diverged into two primary strands along the target appli-
cations of TFG: one strand [42, 65, 73, 76] concentrates
on generating expressive facial movements only from audio
conditions. Meanwhile, the other strand [6, 24, 25, 36, 62,
75] aims to enhance the controllability of talking faces by
introducing a target video as an additional condition. De-
spite these advancements, the audio-driven TFG methods

exhibit limitations, especially in scenarios like video pro-
duction and AI chatbots, where video and speech must be
generated simultaneously.
An emerging area of research is text-driven TFG, which
is relatively under-explored compared to audio-driven TFG.
Several studies [68, 69, 72] have attempted to merge TTS
systems with TFG using a cascade approach, but suffered
from issues like error accumulation or computational bot-
tleneck. A very recent work [43] uses latent features from
TTS systems for face keypoint generation, yet still requires
an additional stage for RGB video production. It highlights
the challenges and complexities in integrating TFG and TTS
systems into a cohesive and unified framework.
In this paper, we propose a unified framework, named
Text-to-Speaking Face ( TTSF ), which integrates text-
driven TFG and face-stylised TTS. The key to our method
lies in analysing mutually complementary elements across
distinct tasks and leveraging this analysis to construct an
improved framework. As illustrated in Fig. 1, our frame-
work is capable of simultaneously generating talking face
videos and natural speeches given text and a face portrait.
To combine the different tasks in a single model, we tackle
the primary challenges inherent in each task, TFG and TTS.
Firstly, our approach enables the generation of a range of
head poses that reflect real-world scenarios. To encompass
dynamic and authentic facial movements, we propose a mo-
tion sampler based on Optimal-Transport Conditional Flow
Matching (OT-CFM). This approach learns Ordinary Dif-
ferential Equations (ODEs) to extract precise motion codes
from a sophisticated distribution. Nonetheless, considera-
tions need to be taken into account to apply OT-CFM to the
motion sampling process. Direct prediction of target mo-
tion by OT-CFM results in the generation of unsteady facial
motions. To address this issue, we employ an auto-encoder-
based noise reducer to mitigate feature noise through com-
pression and reconstruction of latent features. The com-
pressed features serve as the target motions for our motion
sampler. This demonstrates an enhanced quality of the gen-
erated motion, particularly in terms of temporal consistency.
Secondly, we focus on the challenge of producing con-
sistent voices, specifically when the input identity remains
the same but facial motions differ. This problem arises
from a fundamental inquiry in face-stylised TTS: How can
we extract more refined speaker representations, influenc-
ing prosody, timbre, and accent, from a portrait image?
We observe that facial motion in the source image affects
the ability to identify the characteristics of the target voice.
Nevertheless, this issue has been overlooked in all previous
works [20, 33, 63], as they commonly omit a facial motion
disentanglement module, a crucial component in the TFG
system. With the benefit of integrating the TFG and TTS
models into a system, we present a straightforward yet ef-
fective approach to condition the face-stylised TTS model.By eliminating motion features from the input portrait, our
framework can generate speeches with the consistency of
speaker identity.
In addition to the previously mentioned advantages of
our framework, there are further benefits compared to cas-
cade text-driven TFG systems: (1) our framework does not
require an additional audio encoder, as it can be substituted
with the text encoder in our system, and (2) the joint training
eliminates the need for the fine-tuning process and yields
better-synchronised lip motions in the generated outcomes.
Our contributions can be summarised as follows:
• To our knowledge, we are the first to propose a unified
text-driven multimodal synthesis system with robust gen-
eralisation to unseen identities.
• We design the motion sampler based on OT-CFM that is
combined with the auto-encoder-based noise reducer, by
considering the characteristics of motion features.
• Our method preserves crucial speaker characteristics such
as prosody, timbre, and accent by removing the motion
factors in the source image,
• With the comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate
the proposed method surpasses the cascade-based talking
face generation methods while producing speeches from
the given text.

Audio-driven Talking Face Generation. Audio-driven
Talking Face Generation (TFG) technology has captured
considerable attention in the fields of computer vision and
graphics due to its broad range of applications [8, 77]. In
the early works [16, 17], the focus is on situations with in-
dividual speakers, where a single model generates various
talking faces based on a single identity. Recently, advance-
ments in deep learning have facilitated the creation of more
versatile TFG models [7, 12, 31, 44, 47, 58, 74]. These
models can generate talking faces by incorporating identity
conditions as input. However, these studies overlook head
movements, grappling with the difficulty of disentangling
head poses from facial characteristics linked to identity. To
enhance natural facial movements, some studies integrate
landmarks and mesh [14, 57, 60, 70] or leverage 3D infor-
mation [5, 15, 27, 39]. Despite these efforts, performance
degradation occurs, especially in wild scenarios with low
landmark accuracy. Recent research branches [42, 65, 73,
76] focus on generating vivid facial movements only from
audio conditions. Another branch [6, 24, 25, 36, 62, 75]
demonstrates improved controllability by introducing a tar-
get video as an additional condition. These studies show-
case the creation of realistic talking faces with various facial
movements, encompassing head, eyes, and lip movements.
However, these approaches rely on audio sources for TFG,
limiting their applicability in multimedia scenarios lacking

Text-driven Talking Face Generation. Text-driven TFG
is relatively less explored compared to the field of audio-
driven TFG. Most previous works [18, 31, 32, 38, 59] pri-
marily focus on generating lip regions for text-based redub-
bing or video-based translation tasks. Recent works [68,
69, 72] have tried to incorporate Text-to-Speech (TTS) tech-
nology into the process of TFG through a cascade method.
However, it’s worth noting that the cascade method encoun-
ters bottlenecks in terms of both performance and inference
time [10]. To tackle this issue, the latest study [43] has
delved into the latent features of TTS to generate keypoints
for talking faces. This exploration provides evidence that
leveraging the latent features of a TTS model is advanta-
geous in substituting the latent of an audio encoder for TFG.
In this paper, we unify TTS and TFG tasks to generate
speech and talking face videos concurrently. Furthermore,
we extend the application of TTS in TFG by conditioning
the target voice with the input identity image. As a re-
sult, our model can generate a diverse range of talking face
videos using only a static face image and text as input.
Text-to-Speech. Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems aim to gen-
erate natural speech from text inputs, evolving from early
approaches to recent end-to-end methods [4, 28, 35, 40,
46, 49, 52]. Despite their success, unseen-speaker TTS
systems face a challenge in requiring substantial enroll-
ment data for accurate voice reproduction. While prior
works [9, 22, 26, 34, 41] extract speaker representations
from speech data, obtaining sufficient high-quality utter-
ances is challenging. Recent studies have incorporated
face images for speaker representation [20, 33, 63], aiming
to capture correlations between visual and audio features.
However, these models often neglect motion-related factors
in face images, leading to challenges in generating consis-
tent desired voices when the input identity remains constant
but the motion varies.In this paper, to tackle this issue, we leverage the motion
extractor of TFG to eliminate the motion features from the
source image. The motion-normalised feature is then fed
into the TTS system as a conditioning factor, aiding the TTS
model in producing consistent voices.
3. Method
In Fig. 2, we propose a unified architecture, named TTSF ,
which integrates TFG and TTS pipelines. In the TTS model,
the text input is embedded as etby an embedding layer.
The text encoder Etmaps this embedding to the text fea-
tureft∈Rlt×d, where ltandddenote the token length
and hidden dimension, respectively. The duration predic-
tor then upsamples ftto˜ft∈Rlm×dto align with the tar-
get mel-spectrogram’s length lm. The ˜ftis subsequently
passed into the TTS decoder DTTS to predict the target
mel-spectrogram. Both EtandDTTS are conditioned with
the identity feature fidfrom the TFG model to incorporate
the characteristics of the target speaker. In the TFG model,
the source image Isand driving frames Id∈Rt×c×h×w
pass through the shared visual encoder Ev, yielding visual
features fsandfdfor the source and target, respectively.
The motion extractor encodes motion features from the in-
put, obtaining the identity feature fidby subtracting the mo-
tion feature from fs. The target motion feature is denoted as
fm. With the motion fusion module, fid,fm, and the audio
mapper output flipare aggregated and then, input into the
TFG generator Gto generate videos ˆIdwith desired mo-
tions. To produce variational facial movements during in-
ference, we propose a conditional flow matching-based mo-
tion sampler. Additionally, we introduce an auto-encoder-
based motion normaliser aimed at reducing the noise in the
sampled motions. The feature fc, compressed by the nor-
maliser, serves as the motion sampler’s target during train-
ing. Consequently, our framework synthesises natural talk-
ing faces and speeches from a single portrait image and text

condition.
3.1. Baseline for Talking Face Generation
Motion Extractor. Previous research in the fields of mo-
tion transfer [53, 54, 67] and TFG [25, 66] has identified
the presence of a reference space that only contains individ-
ual identities. Formally, we can express this as Ev(I) =
fid+fm, where Iis the input image, Evis the visual en-
coder, fidis an identity feature, and fmis a motion fea-
ture. In our framework, the motion extractor Emlearns the
subtraction of identity feature fidfrom the visual feature:
Em(Ev(I)) =fm=f−fid.Our motion extractor follows
the architecture of LIA [67], featuring a 5-layer MLP and
trainable motion codes under an orthogonality constraint.
This constraint facilitates the representation of diverse mo-
tions with compact channel sizes. Unlike LIA, which com-
putes relative motion between source and target images, our
motion extractor independently extracts identity and motion
features. This distinction is crucial for integrating TFG and
TTS models, where the identity feature conditions TTS to
generate consistent voice styles robust to facial motions.
Motion Fusion and Generator. To establish a baseline for
generating both talking faces and speeches, we consider two
key aspects in designing the TFG generator G: (1) mem-
ory efficiency and (2) resilience to unseen identity gener-
ation. To reflect these, we avoid using an inversion net-
work, known for its computational heaviness, and opt for
a flow-based generator that focuses on learning coordinate
mapping. For our generator, we choose LIA’s one, which
employs a StyleGAN [1]-styled generator as a baseline.
However, LIA is explicitly tailored for face-to-face mo-
tion transfer and does not account for generating lip move-
ments synchronised with an audio source. To apply LIA
to TFG, specific considerations are needed. In the training
process, the lack of augmentation for target frames leads
to the model replicating lip motions from the target frames
rather than from audio sources. In response to this, inspired
by FC-TFG [25], we regulate lip motions by incorporating
audio features into specific n-th layers of the decoder. The
fusion process involves a straightforward linear operation:
fz,n=fid+fmi∈ {non-lip motion layers }
fid+flip i∈ {lip motion layers },(1)
where, fmdenotes the target motions extracted from tar-
get frames and flipdenotes the output of the audio mapper,
representing lip motion features. In the end, we generate
the final videos ˆIdby inputting the style feature fz,ninto
the TFG generator G.
Audio Mapper. Unlike the cascade text-driven TFG, our
framework does not require extracting acoustic features us-
ing an audio encoder. Instead, we utilise the intermediate
representations of the TTS system, serving a definite pur-

pose: Generating natural lip motion with the TFG genera-
tor. This feature is crafted by aggregating the concatenated
features of text embedding et, the upsampled text feature
˜ft, and energy which is an average from ˜ftalong the chan-
nel axis. The text embedding enables the TFG model to
grasp phoneme-level lip representation, while the upsam-
pled text feature and energy contribute to capturing intri-
cate lip shapes aligned with the generated speech sound. To
aggregate these different types of features, we use Multi-
Receptive field Fusion (MRF) module [30]. As illustrated
in Fig. 3, the MRF module comprises multiple residual
blocks, each characterised by 1D convolutions with dis-
tinct kernel sizes and dilations. This diverse configura-
tion enables the module to observe both fine and coarse
details in the input along the time axis. To avoid poten-
tial artifacts at the boundaries of motion features caused
by temporal padding operations, we intentionally remove
the padding operation and introduce temporal interpolation.
Consequently, our framework achieves well-synchronised
lip movements while effectively capturing the characteris-
tics of the generated speech.

3.2. Variational Motion Sampling
Preliminary: Conditional Flow Matching. In this sub-
section, we present an outline of Optimal-Transport Condi-
tional Flow Matching (OT-CFM). Our exposition primary
adheres to the notation and definitions in [37, 40].
Letx∈Rdbe the data sample from the target distribu-
tionq(x), and p0(x)be tractable prior distribution. Flow
matching generative models aim to map x0∼p0(x)tox1
by constructing a probability density path pt: [0,1]×Rd→
R>0, such that p1(x)approximates q(x). Consider an arbi-
trary Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE):
d
dtϕt(x) =vt(ϕt(x)), ϕ0(x) =x, (4)
where the vector field vt: [0,1]×Rd→Rdgenerates the
flowϕt: [0,1]×Rd→Rd. This ODE is associated with
pt, and it is sufficient to produce realistic data if a neural
network can predict an accurate vector field vt.
Suppose there exists the optimal vector field utthat can
generate accurate pt, then the neural network vt(x;θ)can
be trained to estimate the vector field ut. However, in prac-
tice, it is non-trivial to find the optimal vector field utand
the target probability pt. To address this, [37] leverages the
fact that estimation of conditional vector field is equivalent
to estimation of the unconditional one, i.e.,
min
θEt,pt(x)∥ut(x)−vt(x;θ)∥2
≡min
θEt,q(x1),pt(x|x1)∥ut(x|x1)−vt(x;θ)∥2(5)
with boundary condition p0(x|x1) = p0(x)and
p1(x|x1) =N(x|x1, σ2I)for sufficiently small σ.
Meanwhile, [37] further generalise this technique with
noise condition x0∼ N(0,1), and define OT-CFM loss as:
LOT−CFM(θ) =Et,q(x1),p0(x0)∥uOT
t(ϕOT
t(x0)|x1)
−vt(ϕOT
t(x0)|µ;θ)∥2,(6)
where µis the predicted frame-wise mean of x1and
ϕOT
t(x0) = (1 −(1−σmin)t)x0+tx1is the flow from
x0tox1. The target conditional vector field become
uOT
t(ϕOT
t(x0)|x1) =x1−(1−σmin)x0, which enables
the improved performance with its inherent linearity. In our
work, we use fixed value of σmin= 10−4.
Prior Network. The prior serves as the initial condition
for OT-CFM, facilitating the identification of the optimal
path to x1. During training, our prior network takes the first
motion fm,0of target motion sequence fmand the acousticfeature flipas inputs. We structure the prior network with
a 4-layer conformer [21], where the input is formed by the
summation of fm,0andflip. Note that the first motion is
replaced as the source image’s motion in inference.
OT-CFM Motion Sampler. The objective of our motion
sampler is to sample a sequence of natural motion codes
from the prior µ. During training, this module aims to pre-
dict target motions fm. However, in our experiments, we
observed that directly regressing fm(equivalent to setting
x1asfm) leads to producing shaky motions during infer-
ence. We expect that this is due to the characteristics of
the StyleGAN-styled decoder. Each channel of the decoder
plays a semantically meaningful role in generating detailed
facial attributes. Therefore, when the motion sampler fails
to successfully estimate the vector field, it directly impacts
the final outcomes. To address this issue, we introduce an
auto-encoder-based motion normaliser that compresses fea-
ture and reconstructs them into the target motion fm. The
compressed motion features fcserve as x1in OT-CFM.
Training Objectives. The reconstruction loss for train-
ing our motion normaliser is defined as Mean Square Error
(MSE) loss between the target motion fmand the recon-
structed motion ˆfmas follows: LAE=∥ˆfm−fm∥2.
Moreover, as motion decoding commences from random
noiseN(µ, I)at inference, our objective is to minimise the
distance between the prior µand compressed target motion
fc. Considering the output of prior network µas parameter-
ising the input noise for the decoder, it is natural to view the
encoder output µas a normal distribution N(µ, I). Follow-
ing [46], we compute a negative log-likelihood prior loss:
Lprior =−TX
j=1logφ(fc,j;µj, I), (7)
where φ(·;µi, I)represents the probability density function
ofN(µi, I), andTdenotes the temporal length of motions.
3.3. Text-to-Speech Synthesis
Our TTS system aims to produce well-stylised speech from
a single portrait, acquired in in-the-wild setting. In this con-
text, we define the in-the-wild environment as follows: (1)
The model is exposed to previously unseen facial data, and
(2) the facial images exhibit various facial poses. First,
since we cannot access to the identity labels to unseen
speakers, we condition our model with image embedding.
Second, our emphasis is on the advantages of our frame-
work. By integrating TFG and TTS systems, we can utilise
the identity feature fid, a motion-removed feature, obtained
from the TFG model. Consequently, our TTS model is ca-
pable of generating speeches robust to various facial mo-
tions in image, maintaining consistency in the style of voice.
Our system is based on Matcha-TTS [40], an OT-CFM-
based TTS model known for synthesising high-quality

feature fidto both encoder and decoder. With this mini-
mal variation, our model is trained with prior, duration, and
OT-CFM losses, as outlined in [40]. These losses are collec-
tively denoted as LTTS. Finally, we convert the generated
mel-spectrogram by using a pretrained vocoder [30].

aforementioned losses, represented as follows:

where hyperparameters λare introduced to balance the
scale of each loss. Each λcontrols the relative importance
of its corresponding loss term. Empirically, the values of
λ1,λ2,λ3,λ4,λ5,λ6,λ7, and λ8are set to 0.1, 1, 0.3, 0.1,
0.1, 1, 0.1, and 1.
4. Experiments
4.1. Experimental Setup
Dataset. Our framework is trained on the LRS3 [3] dataset,
which consists of both talking face videos and transcrip-
tion labels. LRS3 consists of videos captured during indoor
shows of TED or TEDx. We evaluate our model on V ox-
Celeb2 [13] and LRS2 [2] datasets, which contain morechallenging examples than LRS3 since many videos are
shot outdoors. We randomly select a subset of videos from
each dataset to evaluate the performance of our framework.
Implementation Details. First of all, we pretrain a Matcha-
TTS [40] model on the LRS3 dataset for 2,000 epochs and
then jointly train with the talking face generation model for
40 epochs. Our focus is on the manipulation of seven spe-
cific layers within the generator, namely layers 1 to 7. Fur-
thermore, we exclusively input the audio feature into two
specific layers, namely layers 6 and 7. ur motion sampler
is trained with 32-frame videos and then inferences with all
frames of each video. Audio data is sampled to 16kHz, and
converted to mel-spectrogram with a window size of 640, a
hop length of 160, and 80 mel bins. To update our model,
we employ the Adam optimiser [29] with a learning rate set
at1e−4. The entire framework is implemented using Py-
Torch [45] and is trained across eight 48GB A6000 GPUs.
Evaluation Metrics. In our quantitative assessments for
TFG, we employ a range of evaluation metrics introduced
in previous works. To assess the visual quality of the gen-
erated videos, we employ the Fr ´echet Inception Distance
(FID) score and ID Similarity (ID-SIM) score using a pre-
trained face recognition model [23]. To measure the accu-
racy of mouth shapes and lip sync, we utilise the Lip Sync
Error Confidence (LSE-C), a metric introduced in [11]. For
the diversity of the generated head motions, we calculate the

recognition model of [48].
4.2. Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods
Text-driven Talking Face Generation. We compare
several state-of-the-art methods (MakeitTalk [76], Au-
dio2Head [64], and SadTalker [73]) for the text-driven talk-
ing head video generations by attaching our TTS model
to the previous audio-driven TFG models in the cascade
method. To simulate a one-shot talking face generation sce-
nario, we evaluate the baselines on the in-the-wild datasets,
LRS2 and V oxCeleb2. As shown in Table 1, the proposed
model outperforms every audio- and cascade text-driven
method in terms of video quality (FID, ID-SIM) on LRS2.
Additionally, we present experimental results on the V ox-
Celeb2 dataset in Table 5. Since this dataset does not con-
tain text transcription according to the speech in the video,
our framework generates both speech and a talking faceModelsIntel. Nat. Voice similarity

by inputting a single frame from a V oxCeleb2 video and
a randomly selected transcription from LRS3. Similar to
the experimental results on LRS2, our framework exhibits
superior performance in ID-SIM score. On the other hand,
the proposed model records a lower synchronisation score
compared to SadTalker using the LSE-C metric. However,
given that the LSE-C metric relies significantly on a pre-
trained model, a more useful evaluation of lip synchronisa-
tion can be achieved through perceptual judgement by hu-
mans, as assessed in user studies. The qualitative assess-
ment in Section 4.3 shows that our method produces per-
ceptually better synchronised output compared to the base-
line. Although Audio2Head shows the best diversity score,
it records the lowest scores in video quality metrics. We
also observe that Audio2Head completely fails to generate
a natural video when the input source image is not located
in the centre of the screen. On the other hand, our pro-
posed method achieves high scores in both video quality
and diversity metrics. Considering the aforementioned is-
sues, our framework demonstrates robust generalisation to
unseen data when conducting multimodal synthesis encom-
passing both video and speech.
Face-stylised Text-to-Speech. To evaluate the generalis-
ability of our TTS system, we compare our model to Face-
TTS [33], which is a state-of-the-art method of face-stylised
TTS. For the evaluation, we simulate two scenarios on
LRS2 dataset: (1) w/ motion , where the TTS model is condi-
tioned with source image embedding, i.e., fid+fm; (2) w/o
motion , where the model is conditioned with only identity
feature fid. The results are shown in Table 1. While the pro-
posed model shows slight deviance in MCD, it clearly out-
performs the baseline in WER, C-SIM, and RMSE, demon-
strating its superiority in intelligibility and voice similarity.
More importantly, when we consider motion features to-
gether as our speaker condition, the generation performance
is significantly degraded, especially in voice similarity. It
indicates the benefits of unifying TFG and TTS systems,
highlighting the advantages of their integration.

user study involving 40 participants, each providing opin-

ions on 20 videos. Reference images and texts were ran-
domly selected from the LRS2 test split to create videos
using MakeItTalk [76], Audio2Head [64], SadTalker [73],
and our proposed method. Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) are
used for evaluation, following the approach in [25, 36, 75].
Participants rate each video on a scale from 1 to 5, consid-
ering lip sync quality, video realness, and head movement
naturalness. The order of methods within each video clip is
randomly shuffled. The results in Table 4 indicate that our
method outperforms existing methods in generating talking
face videos with higher lip synchronisation and natural head
movement.
Analysis on Qualitative Results. We visually present our
qualitative results in Fig. 4. MakeItTalk fails to produce
precise lip motions aligned with the synthesised speech,
and Audio2Head struggles to preserve identity information.
SadTalker can generate well-synchronised lip motions but
is limited in facial movements. In contrast, our approach
exhibits more dynamic facial movements and can generate
vivid lip motions that reflect both linguistic and acoustic in-
formation. For instance, it can be seen that our model’s lip
motions are precisely aligned to the pronunciation of the
speeches (refer to the yellow arrows). The accuracy and the
details demonstrate that our method can generate realistic
and expressive talking faces.
The Effectiveness of Identity Features. To verify the ef-
fectiveness of identity feature-based conditioning, we visu-
alise the feature space of synthesised audio. Fig. 5 shows t-
SNE [61] plots of x-vectors from Face-TTS and our method.
As shown in Fig. 5a, Face-TTS fails to cluster features de-
rived from the same speaker. This implies the potential fail-
ure to generate the target voice with different styles. In con-
trast, as depicted in Fig. 5b, the proposed TTS system ef-
fectively clusters features derived from the same speaker de-
spite the variety in head motions. This demonstrates that our
method is capable of synthesising consistent voices, even in
the presence of varying motions.

audio mapper. w/o (energy & ˜ft) indicates the TFG model
conditioned with text embedding etfrom the audio mapper.
In this case, the TFG model can incorporate only linguistic
information and it leads to our model failing to generate pre-
cise lip motions. When we additionally input the upsampled
text feature ˜ftto our TFG model, the synchronisation score
improves significantly. This is because our TTS model is
optimised by reducing the prior loss between ˜ftand the
target mel-spectrogram. This indicates that the ˜ftfeature
contains acoustic information. Finally, when we add the
energy feature to the previous condition, our model exhibits
the best performance across all metrics. This indicates that
the energy of speech significantly impacts generation of de-
tailed lip movements.
5. Conclusion
Our work introduces a unified text-driven multimodal syn-
thesis system that exhibits robust generalisation to unseen
identities. The proposed OT-CFM-based motion sampler,
coupled with an auto-encoder-based noise reducer, pro-
duces realistic facial poses. Notably, our method excels in
preserving essential speaker characteristics such as prosody,
timbre, and accent by effectively removing motion fac-
tors from the source image. Our experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our proposed method over cascade-based
talking face generation approaches, underscoring the effec-
tiveness of our unified framework in multimodal speech
synthesis.
