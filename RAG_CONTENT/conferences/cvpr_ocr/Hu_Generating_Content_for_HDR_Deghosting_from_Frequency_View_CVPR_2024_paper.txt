Abstract
Recovering ghost-free High Dynamic Range (HDR) im-
ages from multiple Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images be-
comes challenging when the LDR images exhibit saturation
and significant motion. Recent Diffusion Models (DMs)
have been introduced in HDR imaging field, demonstrat-
ing promising performance, particularly in achieving visu-
ally perceptible results compared to previous DNN-based
methods. However, DMs require extensive iterations with
large models to estimate entire images, resulting in ineffi-
ciency that hinders their practical application. To address
this challenge, we propose the Low-Frequency aware Dif-
fusion (LF-Diff) model for ghost-free HDR imaging. The
key idea of LF-Diff is implementing the DMs in a highly
compacted latent space and integrating it into a regression-
based model to enhance the details of reconstructed im-
ages. Specifically, as low-frequency information is closely
related to human visual perception we propose to utilize
DMs to create compact low-frequency priors for the recon-
struction process. In addition, to take full advantage of the
above low-frequency priors, the Dynamic HDR Reconstruc-
tion Network (DHRNet) is carried out in a regression-based
manner to obtain final HDR images. Extensive experiments
conducted on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our LF-Diff performs favorably against
several state-of-the-art methods and is 10 ×faster than pre-
vious DM-based methods.
1. Introduction
Multiple exposure High Dynamic Range (HDR) imag-
ing aims to restore missing details from exposure-varied
Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images. However, in dy-
namic scenes, it often causes ghosting artifacts due to ob-
ject or camera movement, limiting practical applications.
Researchers are actively exploring ghost-free image recon-

struction methods to enable seamless capture of dynamic
scenes with high dynamic ranges.
In recent years, the rise of Deep Neural Net-
works (DNNs) has brought significant advancements to
HDR imaging field. Numerous DNN-based methods
have emerged, employing Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) [11, 41, 47] or Vision Transformers (ViTs) [16, 28]
for HDR image reconstruction. Despite their advancements,
DNN-based approaches face challenges when essential in-
formation ( e.g., content, details) for overexposed areas is
missing due to object or camera movement. More recently,
Diffusion Models (DMs) [8, 26] have exhibited impressive
performance in image synthesis [4, 29] and image recon-
struction tasks (including HDR imaging) [24, 44, 46]. DMs
achieve this by iteratively denoising Gaussian noise to gen-
erate high-fidelity images. Yan et al. [44] reconstruct com-
plete HDR images from pure Gaussian noise, yielding im-
pressive results. Note that, compared to previous Deep gen-
erative models [14, 21], DMs generate a more accurate tar-
get distribution without facing issues like optimization in-
stability or mode collapse, making them a promising choice
for enhancing HDR image quality. Nonetheless, DMs de-
mand a substantial number of iteration steps on denois-
ing models to capture intricate data details, which is time-
consuming even with a high-end GPU card. For example,
as shown in Fig. 1, DiffHDR [44] takes about 7.5 seconds
to generate an HDR image on a single A100 GPU.
This CVPR paper is the Open Access version, provided by the Computer Vision Foundation.
Except for this watermark, it is identical to the accepted version;
the final published version of the proceedings is available on IEEE Xplore.

In this paper, our goal is to devise a DM-based method
that effectively harnesses the robust distribution mapping
capabilities of DMs for HDR image reconstruction. We
note that it is unnecessary to reconstruct a complete HDR
image from pure noise, because the LDR reference im-
ages already provide most of the necessary content infor-
mation for HDR images. As low-frequency information is
closely related to human visual perception [34], we propose
to utilize DMs to create compact low-frequency priors in
the latent space. These priors are then integrated into the
regression-based model to predict the low-frequency con-
tent of the reconstructed HDR images.
To achieve our goal, we propose the Low-Frequency
Aware Diffusion Model (LF-Diff), comprising a Low-
Frequency Prior Extraction Network (LPENet), a denois-
ing network, and a Dynamic HDR Reconstruction Network
(DHRNet). Following established methods [3, 23, 39], we
employ a two-stage training strategy for pre-train LF-Diff
and DM training. In the first stage, LPENet learns to extract
a compact Low-frequency Prior Representation (LPR) from
ground-truth images, guiding the DHRNet. DHRNet con-
sists of two modules: a Prior Integration Module (PIM) that
fuses the LPR with intermediate features of DHRNet, and
a Feature Refinement Module (FRM) that further processes
the fused features to HDR image. Notably, LPENet and
DHRNet are optimized together in this phase. In the second
stage, we train DM to learn the compact LPR directly from
LDR images. Since the LPR is lightweight and only used
to low-frequency content for HDR imaging, our DM can
estimate the LPR with extremely low computational cost,
ensuring stable visual results after multiple iterations.
The main contributions can be summarized as follows:
• We introduce LF-Diff, a straightforward and efficient
DM-based method for HDR imaging. LF-Diff leverages
the capabilities of diffusion models to generate informa-
tive low-frequency priors, which are then integrated into
the imaging process to enhance results.
• We propose PIM and FRM in the DHRNet to fully exploit
the LPR. While PIM efficiently fuses the LPR with inter-
mediate features of DHRNet, FRM further processes the
fused features to reconstruct high-quality HDR images.
• Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LF-
Diff method achieves SOTA performance in HDR imag-
ing tasks, and produces visually appealing results that
align with human visual perception. But consuming
significantly fewer computational resources compared to
other DM-based methods.
2. Related Work
Ghost-free HDR Reconstruction. Traditional methods of-
ten employ motion rejection [7, 40], motion registration
[31, 36], and patch matching [9, 25] approaches to align
LDR images and reconstruct high-quality results. However,these methods heavily rely on the performance of prepro-
cessing techniques and often face challenges when deal-
ing with motions across large spatial extents. Subsequently,
DNN-based methods have emerged as the mainstream ap-
proach, thanks to their superior nonlinear expression capa-
bility. Researchers have explored various applications of
DNNs in HDR imaging, devising sophisticated network ar-
chitectures and model optimization schemes, such as atten-
tion [1, 41], transformer [16, 28, 30], optical flow [11, 22],
GAN [6, 14, 21], and others [5, 15, 42, 43, 47]. Never-
theless, when LDR images lack sufficient information due
to motion or saturation, they often manifest artifacts not
aligned with human visual perception, commonly referred
to as ghosting.
Diffusion Models. Diffusion models have recently demon-
strated promising results in various low-level vision tasks,
including super-resolution [13, 24], HDR reconstruction
[44, 46], colorization [12, 35], and deblurring [37].
DiffHDR [44] applied the conventional diffusion model
paradigm to reconstruct HDR images, yielding remarkable
outcomes. However, due to the high computational cost of
diffusion models along with the requirement for numerous
iterative steps, inference speed is limited. Despite efforts to
mitigate this constraint [2, 17, 27], the overall complexity
remains high, especially for high-resolution images com-
monly encountered in HDR scenarios. Recently, several
methods [3, 23, 39] have addressed this issue by conducting
diffusion modeling in the latent space. Rombach et al. [23]
employed an autoencoder model to compress images into
features equivalent to the image space. HI-Diff [3] lever-
ages diffusion-based vector features for assisting image de-
blurring. However, given the unique characteristics of HDR
imaging, further exploration is needed to select an appropri-
ate latent space for HDR reconstruction tasks.
3. Preliminaries
The diffusion model introduced by Sohl-Dickstein et al.
[26] is inspired by nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Here,
we provide a brief overview of the ”variance-preserving”
diffusion model from [8], which encompasses diffusion pro-
cesses and reverse processes.
Diffusion Process. Given a clean image distribution,
the diffusion process gradually injects isotropic Gaussian
noise to generate xtaccording to a variance schedule
β1,···, βT∈(0,1). Letαt= 1−βt,¯αt=QT
i=1αi:
q(xt|x0) =N(xt;√¯αtx0,(1−¯αt)I). (1)
The closed-form for this process can be represented as:
xt(x0, ϵt) =√¯αtx0+√
1−¯αtϵt, ϵ∈(0,I), (2)
where xtrepresents the output at time t,x0is the initial
clean image, and ϵtdenotes isotropic Gaussian noise.

ZˆFigure 2. The proposed LF-Diff comprises DHRNet, LPRNet, and a denoising network. LF-Diff undergoes two training stages: Pretrain
LF-Diff (Sec. 4.1) and DM training (Sec. 4.2). Notably, during the inference stage, we do not input the ground-truth image into LPENet DM
and the denoising networks. Instead, we solely utilize the reverse process of DMs.
Reverse Process. The reverse process attempts to approx-
imate the data distribution q(x0)by a Markovian process,
starting with random Gaussian noise xT=N(xT;0,I):
q(xt−1|xt, x0) =N(xt−1; ˜µt(xt, x0),˜βtI), (3)
where ˜µtand˜βtare distribution parameters. Since the true
reverse process Eq.(3) relies on q(x0)and is intractable,
the neural network fθserves as the denoiser to estimate
pθ(xt−1|xt, t)instead of q(xt−1|xt, x0):
pθ(xt−1|xt, t) =N(xt−1;µθ(xt, t),Σθ(xt, t))
=q(xt−1|fθ(xt, t)),(4)
where µθandΣθare the parameters to be estimated in the
reverse process. Let fixed variances ( Σθ(xt, t) =˜βtI), the
optimization objective can be defined as:
Et,x0,ϵt[∥ϵt−fθ(√¯αtx0+√
1−¯αtϵt, t)∥2]. (5)
4. Methodology
As depicted in Fig. 2, we introduce the proposed LF-
Diff framework, which consists of two training stages. Dur-
ing the first stage, we pre-train LF-Diff to extract accu-
rate low-frequency prior representations from ground truths
using LPENet, while DHRNet learns how to utilize the
above priors to reconstruct HDR images. During the sec-
ond stage, we train the DM to accurately predict the low-
frequency prior representations directly from LDR images,
and jointly optimize it with DHRNet to generate final high-
quality HDR images.4.1. Stage One: Pretrain LF-Diff
In the first stage, our objective is to train the LPENet
how to extract accurate low-frequency prior features from
ground truth and embed this representation into the DHR-
Net to guide the reconstruction process. As illustrated in
Fig. 2 (a), we utilize the Prior Integration Module (PIM)
to incorporate these prior features into the DHRNet via
the cross-attention mechanism. Within DHRNet, multiple
Feature Refinement Modules (FRM) are stacked to directly
learn the mapping relationship from input features to the tar-
get image distribution, while PIM leverages prior features to
assist in recovering the low-frequency content of the recon-
structed images. Next, we elaborate on above descriptions.
Low-frequency Prior Extraction Network. The
LPENet has a straightforward structure, as shown in Fig.
2 (a), comprising several residual blocks designed to ex-
tract the Low-frequency Prior Representation (LPR). Start-
ing with the ground truth image Igt∈RH×W×3, we ini-
tially perform a tonemapping operation T(·)to obtain the
LDR domain ground truth image T(Igt). We concatenate
these images along the channel dimension and employ the
PixelUnshuffle operation to downsample, generating the in-
put for LPENet. Subsequently, LPENet extracts the LPR
z∈RH
k×W
k×3as follows:
z= LPENet (PixelUnshuffle (Concat ( Igt,T(Igt)))),(6)
where T(x) =log(1+µx)
log(1+µ)denotes the tonemapping opera-
tor,µ= 5000 is a predefined constant parameter that con-
trols the degree of compression applied to the input signal,
kdenotes the sampling multiple of PixelUnshuffle.
25734
Dynamic HDR Reconstruction Network. As illus-
trated in Fig. 2 (a), DHRNet consists of multiple stacked
Reconstruction Blocks, with each block comprising one
Prior Integration Module (PIM) and NFeature Refinement
Module (FRM). PIM fuses the LPR with intermediate fea-
tures of DHRNet, we will give a detailed description in
the following part. FRM is designed based on the under-
standing that natural images encompass diverse frequen-
cies, since high and low frequencies serve distinct roles in
image encoding.
In Fig. 3 (a), the structure of FRM involves sev-
eral blocks. Specifically, we begin by processing the fea-
tures through a residual block to obtain Fn−1. Subse-
quently, we decouple these features into two components:
high-frequency features Fhigh
n−1, which remain resolution-
invariant, and low-frequency features Flow
n−1with reduced
resolution, following the approach described in [18]:
Flow
n−1= Avgpool ( Fn−1, k),
Fhigh
n−1=Fn−1−Upsample 
Flow
n−1
,(7)
where kdenotes the kernel size of the avgpooling layer,
Upsample denotes the upsampling operator. In essence,
low-frequency features capture global dependencies within
the input (image/features) and do not necessitate a high-
resolution feature map, but require global attention. On the
other hand, high-frequency features capture detailed local
information, requiring a high-resolution feature map, and
only can be achieved through local operators. Therefore, we
employ the residual block (RB) to process Fhigh
n−1and utilize
the self-attention (SA) from [45] to handle Flow
n−1. Subse-
quently, we fuse the low- and high-frequency features to
preserve the initial details, resulting in the feature F′
n−1.
This operation can be represented as follows:
F′
n−1=Concath
RB
Fhigh
n−1
, Upsample
SA
Flow
n−1i
.
(8)
Considering that F′
n−1is a concatenation of two features,
a1×1Conv is employed to effectuate a reduction in the
number of channels. This downsizing step is followed by
a channel attention module, designed to accentuate those
channels exhibiting heightened activation values.
In order to effectively merge the prior feature derived
from the LPENet with the intermediate feature produced by
DHRNet, we replaced the self-attention mechanism in the
low-frequency branch of FRM with a carefully designed
cross-attention mechanism, resulting in the Prior Integra-
tion Module (PIM). As depicted in Fig. 2 (a), a PIM is
positioned before each reconstruction block. Within each
PIM, cross-attention computations are performed between
the prior and intermediate features to facilitate feature fu-
sion. This module enables the aggregation of information
from the prior feature into the features of DHRNet.

larly, zis transformed into key Kand value Vthrough anal-
ogous operations. Next, we reshape these projections into
matrices suitable for attention computation: ˆQ∈RˆHˆW×ˆC,
ˆK∈RˆN×ˆHˆW, and ˆV∈RˆHˆW×ˆN. We then calculate a
more computationally efficient attention map A∈RˆN×ˆC
by performing dot product between ˆQandˆK. The process
can be described as follows:
ˆF=WcˆV·Softmax( ˆK·ˆQ/γ) +F, (9)
where γis a trainable parameter. Notably, we do not imple-
ment multi-head attention in PIM.
Training Strategy. As proposed in [11], we ini-
tially transform the provided set of input LDR images
{L1, L2, . . . , L N}into their corresponding HDR versions
Hiusing gamma correction. Subsequently, we concatenate
eachLiwith its corresponding Hialong the channel axis
to generate six-channel input tensors Xi= [Li, Hi]. Simi-
lar to [16, 41, 44], we employ an alignment module [41] to
process the input LDR images, align the features implicitly,
and feed them into DHRNet. Then, the LPR feature zex-
tracted from LPENet is injected into DHRNet via PIM. The
reconstructed HDR image ˆHis generated by:
ˆH= Conv 3×3(DHRNet ( Xi, z)). (10)
Following previous approaches [16, 41], we utilize both
25735
tonemapped per-pixel loss and perceptual loss as the im-
age reconstruction loss function Lr. This dual-loss strategy
optimizes both pixel-level accuracy and high-level feature
representations in the generated HDR results:
Lr=∥T(H)−T(ˆH))∥1+λ∥ϕi,j(T(H))−ϕi,j(T(ˆH))∥1,(11)
where ϕi,j(·)signifies the j-th convolutional feature ex-
tracted from the VGG19 network after the i-th maxpooling
operation, and λ=1e-2 is a hyperparameter that balances
the contribution of the each component.
4.2. Stage Two: Diffusion Models for HDR Imaging
After the above-mentioned learning procedure, we now
possess LDR images and their corresponding LPR z. In the
second stage (Fig. 2 (b, c)), our objective is to efficiently
harness the powerful distribution estimation capability of
the DMs. Specifically, we utilize the LPENet from stage
one to capture the LPR as the denoising target of the DM.
The DM will learn how to extract accurate LPR from the
LDR inputs and perform joint optimization with DHRNet.
Diffusion Model for LRP Learning. After capturing
the LPR z∈RH
k×W
k×Nfrom the pretrained LPENet, we
transform the clean LPR feature zinto a noisy version zT
using Eq.(2), which can be described as:
q(zT|z) =N 
zT;√¯αTz,(1−¯αT)I
, (12)
where Trepresents the total number of iterations, while ¯αt
andαdenote the pre-defined variance schedule.
In the reverse process, we iteratively generate the LPR
from a pure Gaussian distribution, starting from zTand
moving backward to z0, which utilizes the posterior distri-
bution described in Eq. (3). Following previous work [24,
44], we utilize a neural network to estimate pθ(xt−1|xt, t)
instead of q(xt−1|xt, x0)for each step. Specifically, we
first use LPENet DMto obtain a conditional feature D∈
RH
k×W
k×Nfrom aligned LDR feature:
D= LPENet DM(AM(PixelUnshuffle ( Xi))),(13)
where LPENet DM maintains a similar architecture to
LPENet but with a modified input dimensionality for its
first convolution layer, AM(·)denotes alignment module
from [41]. The denoising neural network predicts the noise
based on both ztand the derived conditional feature D,i.e.,
ϵθ(Concat (zt,D), t). Upon substituting this estimated
noise term into the equation governing the reverse process
Eq. (4), we arrive at the following sampling formula:
zt−1=1√αt
zt−1−αt√1−¯αtϵθ(zt,D, t)
+√
1−αtϵt,
(14)
where ϵt∼ N (0,I). By iteratively sampling ztusing Eq.
(14)Ttimes, we progressively reconstruct the predicted
LPR representation z0(i.e.ˆz)∈RH
k×W
k×N.Training Strategy. Traditional DMs solely learn the
probability distribution by optimizing the weighted varia-
tional bound (Eq. (5)), resulting in a slight deviation be-
tween the predicted prior and the actual prior. Integrating
the DM directly with DHRNet might lead to a misalignment
issue, thereby hampering the overall image processing per-
formance. To address this, we joint training the DM and
DHRNet. During each training iteration, we first sample
the noise sample ztthrough the diffusion process (Eq. (2)).
Given that our denoising neural network is lightweight, we
use a reverse process for Siterations based on the DDIM
strategy [27] to generate the predicted prior feature ˆz. This
ˆzguides DHRNet via PIM. The loss function in the second
stage consists of the reconstruction loss Lr(Eq. (11)) and
the diffusion loss Ldiff:
Ldiff=Ez0,t,ϵt∼N(0,I)h
∥ϵt−ϵθ(zt, D, t)∥2i
+∥ˆz−z∥1.(15)
4.3. Inference
In the inference stage, LPENet DM extracts a condi-
tional feature Dfrom aligned LDR feature (Eq. (13)), and
we randomly sample a Gaussian noise ˆzT. Then, denois-
ing neural network utilizes the ˆzTandDto estimate LPR
after Siterations (Eq. (14)) based on DDIM [27]. After
that, DHRNet exploits the LPR to restore HDR images as
Eq. (10). More details about the DM training and the model
inference can be found in the supplementary material.
5. Experiments
5.1. Experimental Settings
Datasets. All methods are trained using two publicly avail-
able datasets, employing identical training settings: Kalan-
tari’s dataset [11] and Hu’s dataset [10]. Kalantari’s dataset
consists of 74 samples for training and 15 for testing, all
captured under authentic environmental conditions. Each
sample comprises three LDR images with exposure varia-
tions of {-2, 0, +2 }or{-3, 0, +3 }. In contrast, Hu’s dataset
is a synthetic dataset designed to emulate sensor realism,
generated through a game engine. This dataset contains im-
ages captured at three distinct exposure levels {-2, 0, +2 },
with our primary focus on dynamic scene images within this
collection. Following the settings outlined in [10], we allo-
cate the initial 85 samples for training, reserving the remain-
ing 15 for testing. Moreover, to further validate the model’s
generalizability, we incorporate Sen et al.’s dataset [25] and
Tursun et al. ’s dataset [32] exclusively for qualitative as-
sessment, as these datasets lack ground truths.
Evaluation Metrics. To conduct a quantitative compari-
son, we utilize five objective metrics: PSNR- µ, SSIM- µ,
PSNR-L, SSIM-L, and HDR-VDP-2 [20]. Here, the sub-

scripts µand L denote that these metrics are computed in
the tonemapped and linear domains, respectively.
Implementation Details. Our implementation is conducted
using PyTorch, and each training stage converges after 300
epochs on four NVIDIA A100 GPUs. We employ the Adam
optimizer with an initial learning rate of 1e-4, which decays
by a factor of 0.1 after every 50 epochs. The training dataset
is processed by cropping 128×128patches with a stride of
64, and the batch size is set to 64. For LF-Diff, we adopt
a variant of the commonly used U-Net architecture from
[19] as the denoising network, with 3 levels of blocks {2, 2,
2}. During training, the time step Tis set to 200, and the
implicit sampling step Sis set to 10 for both training and
inference phases to achieve efficient restoration. In DHR-
Net, the parameters Ni∈ {L1, L2, L3}are set to {3, 3, 3},
and the channel Cis set to 60. The number of attention
heads for the self-attention branch at the same level is set
to{6, 6, 6 }, and the channel expansion factor in FFN is
2.66. The kernels for avgpool in PIM and FRM are set to
4 and 2, respectively. For LPENet, it comprises 4 residual
blocks, with a Pixelunshuffle downsampling factor of 4 and
the output channel of 3.
5.2. Comparison with the State-of-the-art Methods
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the pro-
posed LF-Diff method and present experimental results to
validate its reconstruction performance compared to state-
of-the-art techniques. Specifically, we evaluate LF-Diff
against two patch-based methods [9, 25], a optical flow-
based method [11], five CNN-based methods [1, 15, 21,
38, 41], two ViT-based methods [16, 43], along with a
diffusion-based method [44]. It’s worth noting that all deep
learning methods employ the same training dataset and set-
tings for consistency.Datasets w/ Ground Truth. The quantitative outcomes
for LF-Diff on two datasets are presented in Tab. 1.
Our method is compared with various state-of-the-art ap-
proaches using the testing data from [11] and [10], which
includes challenging samples characterized by saturated
backgrounds and foreground motions. All quantitative re-
sults are averaged across testing images. Notably, LF-Diff
exhibits a significant improvement over other leading meth-
ods, exceeding the performance of the DM-based method
DiffHDR [44], by 0.65 dB and 0.86 dB in PSNR- µand
PSNR-L metrics, respectively, based on Kalantari’s dataset
[11]. Moreover, LF-Diff showcases superior performance
compared to the runner-up method, HyHDR [43], with im-
provements of 0.28 dB and 0.19 dB in PSNR- µand PSNR-
L metrics, respectively, on Hu’s dataset [10].
As shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b), the datasets present
some challenging samples due to information loss in the
LDR images. Most existing approaches struggle in these
areas, producing ghosting artifacts due to large motions
and occlusions. Kalantari’s method [11] and DHDR [38]
struggle with background motion due to error-prone align-
ments ( e.g., optical flow), resulting in undesirable ghost-
ing. While HDR-GAN [21] exhibits noticeable ghosting
artifacts around the balcony area and introduces erroneous
color information, AHDR [41] aligns LDR images using
convolutional spatial attention. However, it unintentionally
suppresses valuable contextual information and encounters
difficulties with significant motions in over/underexposed
scenes. CA-ViT [16], relying on patch-based sampling, pro-
duces noticeable blocky ghosting. In contrast, aided by the
DM, both Diff-HDR [44] and our LF-Diff generate HDR
images aligned with human perception. Notably, our ap-
proach outperforms Diff-HDR with faster inference speeds
and a smaller computational overhead.

Datasets w/o Ground Truth. To assess the generalization
capability of our proposed HDR imaging method, we eval-
uated the performance of the model trained on Kalantari et
al.’s Dataset [11] by testing it on datasets from Sen et al.
[25] and Tursun et al. [33], which lack ground truths. In
Fig. 5 (a), numerous current methods encounter difficulties
in restoring recover the large saturated region and large mo-
tion. Conversely, in Fig. 5 (b), while complete elimination
of ghosting remains elusive for any method, our approach
notably enhances image sharpness and detail compared to
preceding techniques.
Computational Budgets. We also conducted comparisons
regarding model parameters and inference times with pre-
vious approaches. As illustrated in Table 2, patch match-
based methods [9, 25] exhibit significantly longer inference
times due to their CPU-based computation. Kalantari [11]
requires considerable time for initial optical flow alignment.
NHDRRNet [42], employing a U-shaped network architec-
ture, demonstrates shorter inference times but substantially
higher parameter counts compared to other methods. CA-
ViT [16] has a large number of standard transformer blocks
leading to high computational cost despite fewer parame-ters. DiffHDR [44] has high inference time and parameter
count due to reconstructing HDR from pure noise. In com-
parison, our method effectively leverages the powerful dis-
tribution estimation capability of DM with orders of magni-
tude fewer parameters and computations.
5.3. Ablation Study
In this section, we investigate the impact of various de-
signs within our proposed method. All experiments are con-
ducted using the Kalantari’s dataset [11].
Effects of Diffusion Prior. As shown in Tab. 3, we
establish a regression-based baseline model without LPR
generation. In this configuration, the PIM in DHRNet is
replaced with FRM, and HDR images are reconstructed
through a regression-based approach. LF-Diff s1is a pre-
trained model in the first stage utilizing ground-truth im-
ages to provide LPR. Compared to the baseline, this brings
a 8.7dB PSNR-L improvement, demonstrating that an ac-
curate compact prior can greatly enhance results. Variant
LF-Diff s2w/o DM does not use the DM, but instead di-
rectly learns the LPR using LPENet. This achieves a 0.16dB
PSNR gain over the baseline. When learning the LPR based

on the DM, LF-Diff s2w/ DM further improves PSNR by
0.24dB compared to variant LF-Diff s2w/o DM, This indi-
cates that the DM demonstrates superior capability in accu-
rately estimating the distribution for LPR prediction. Ad-
ditionally, compared to DiffHDR, which requires over 70M
Params for estimating complete images, LF-Diff only adds
2.39M Params over the baseline. Moreover, we present vi-
sual comparisons of the baseline (without the prior feature)
and LF-Diff variants in Fig. 6. It can be observed that per-
forming DM in a compact latent space to predict LPR ef-
fectively mitigates ghosting issues.
Effects of Joint Training Strategy. We conducted an ab-
lation study on the joint training strategy. Under this strat-
egy, only the DM is optimized in the second stage, referred
to as Split-Training. Specifically, we first utilize the pre-
trained LPENet to generate the prior feature zfrom the
ground truth, and then apply the training objective defined
in Eq. (15) to independently train the DM. Subsequently,
the trained DM is directly integrated with the DHRNet for
evaluation. It’s worth noting that the DHRNet in the sec-
ond stage utilizes pre-trained weights from the stage one
without additional training. It is evident that LF-Diff sig-
nificantly outperforms Split-Training by 1.51 dB in terms
of PSNR value. This comparison underscores the effective-
ness of joint training strategy over Split-Training.
Sampling Step. In addition to the lightweight DM struc-
ture and compact feature dimensions, our method achieves
greater computational efficiency by employing a smaller
sampling step, denoted as S, in the reverse process based
on DDIM [27].The performance of our method is demon-
strated with different values of S ranging from 5 to 100, as
presented in Tab. 4. Variations in sampling steps, when S
is set to a value smaller than the training configuration, a
noticeable performance degradation occurs. On the other
hand, when S is larger than the training setting, the impact
on performance is minimal, particularly with the SSIM met-
ric remaining consistently unchanged. While a larger sam-
pling step is known to enhance the visual quality of images
in diffusion-based methods [24, 44], in our case, it primar-
ily increases inference time. This observation suggests that
larger sampling steps, such as S = 1000 in DiffHDR [44]
and SR3 [24], may not be essential for diffusion-based HDR
reconstruction and other related low-level vision tasks when
using our proposed framework.Method GT DMJoint

6. Conclusion
The potential of diffusion models in HDR deghosting
has shown promising results, particularly in achieving vi-
sually perceptible outcomes. Different from image synthe-
sis which generates each pixel from scratch, HDR imaging
provides several LDR images as reference. Thus, it is inef-
ficient to reconstruct the full HDR image starting from pure
Gaussian noise. In this paper, we propose an efficient dif-
fusion model called LF-Diff, consisting of LPENet, DHR-
Net, and a denoising network. Specifically, we apply the
DM in a compact latent space to predict low-frequency pri-
ors of HDR images. These prior features provide explicit
guidance for the image reconstruction process, thereby en-
hancing the details of the reconstructed HDR images. Com-
pared to traditional DM-based methods, LF-Diff achieves
accurate estimations and reduces artifacts in reconstructed
images with much lower computational cost.
