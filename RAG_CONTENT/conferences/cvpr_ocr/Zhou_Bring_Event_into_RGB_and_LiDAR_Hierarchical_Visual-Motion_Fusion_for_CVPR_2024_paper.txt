Abstract
Single RGB or LiDAR is the mainstream sensor for the
challenging scene ﬂow, which relies heavily on visual fea-
tures to match motion features. Compared with single modal-
ity, existing methods adopt a fusion strategy to directly fuse
the cross-modal complementary knowledge in motion space.
However, these direct fusion methods may suffer the modality
gap due to the visual intrinsic heterogeneous nature between
RGB and LiDAR, thus deteriorating motion features. We dis-
cover that event has the homogeneous nature with RGB and
LiDAR in both visual and motion spaces. In this work, we
bring the event as a bridge between RGB and LiDAR, and
propose a novel hierarchical visual-motion fusion frame-
work for scene ﬂow, which explores a homogeneous space to
fuse the cross-modal complementary knowledge for physical
interpretation. In visual fusion, we discover that event has a
complementarity (relative v.s. absolute) in luminance space
with RGB for high dynamic imaging, and has a complemen-
tarity (local boundary v.s. global shape) in scene structure
space with LiDAR for structure integrity. In motion fusion,
we ﬁgure out that RGB, event and LiDAR are complementary
(spatial-dense, temporal-dense v.s. spatiotemporal-sparse)
to each other in correlation space, which motivates us to
fuse their motion correlations for motion continuity. The pro-
posed hierarchical fusion can explicitly fuse the multimodal
knowledge to progressively improve scene ﬂow from visual
space to motion space. Extensive experiments have been
performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method.
1. Introduction
Scene ﬂow aims to model the correspondence between
adjacent visual RGB or LiDAR features to estimate 3D mo-
tion features, which has been applied in various vision tasks,
e.g., 3D object detection [ 1] and motion segmentation [ 2].
The key to scene ﬂow estimation is the highly discriminative

Figure 1. Illustration of the main idea. There exists a large modality
gap due to the visual intrinsic heterogeneous nature between RGB
and LiDAR, thus deteriorating the motion features. We discover
that the event has the homogeneous nature with RGB and LiDAR in
both visual and motion spaces. In this work, we bring the event as a

visual feature for the valid motion feature matching.
Existing scene ﬂow methods can be divided into two
categories: unimodal direct learning methods [ 3–7] and mul-
timodal motion fusion methods [ 8,9]. Unimodal direct
learning methods mainly resort to the ideal visual feature to
directly learn the motion feature from single RGB or LiDAR
modality. Multimodal motion fusion methods further exploit
the complementary knowledge between RGB and LiDAR to
fuse their features in the motion space. For example, Liu et
al.[9] fused dense RGB motion features and sparse LiDAR
motion features for scene ﬂow. However, these methods
neglect the visual intrinsic heterogeneous nature, e.g., de-
graded visual RGB features with weakened texture under low
light due to low dynamic range and limited visual LiDAR
features with incomplete contour due to non-uniform laser
beam. These can enlarge the modality gap and deteriorate the
motion features. Therefore, we suggest that introducing an
auxiliary modality as the bridge to assistantly enhance the

RGB and LiDAR features in both visual and motion spaces.
To our investigation, event camera [ 10] is a neuromorphic
sensor, which can sense the dynamic scene boundary struc-
ture with high dynamic range and high temporal resolution.
In visual space, RGB records the absolute value of luminance
while the event triggers the relative change of luminance,
and LiDAR reﬂects the global shape of the scene while the
event senses the local boundary. In motion space, we trans-
form the visual features of these modalities into correlation
space, and we ﬁgure out that RGB provides the spatial-dense
2D features, event provides the temporal-dense 2D features,
and LiDAR provides the spatiotemporal-sparse 3D features.
Therefore, the event has the complementarity with RGB and
LiDAR in visual homogeneous ( i.e., luminance and struc-
ture) and motion homogeneous ( i.e., correlation) spaces.
In this work, we bring the auxiliary event as a bridge
between RGB and LiDAR in Fig. 1, and propose a novel
hierarchical visual-motion fusion framework for scene ﬂow
(VisMoFlow), which focuses on fusing the cross-modal com-
plementary knowledge in the homogeneous space. In visual
luminance fusion, we fuse the relative luminance of event
and the absolute luminance of RGB for high dynamic imag-
ing with the theoretically derived spatiotemporal gradient
consistency. In visual structure fusion, we fuse the local
boundary of event into the global shape of LiDAR for phys-
ical structure integrity using the self-similarity clustering
strategy. In motion correlation fusion, we map event, RGB
and LiDAR into the same motion manifold, and fuse the
x, y-axis spatial-dense correlation features of RGB, the x,
y-axis temporal-dense correlation features of event and the x,
y, z-axis sparse correlation features of LiDAR for 3D motion
spatiotemporal continuity by aligning the motion distribu-
tions between various modalities. The proposed hierarchical
visual-motion fusion can explicitly learn the multimodal
complementary knowledge from visual to motion space for
scene ﬂow. Overall, the main contributions are as follows:
•We bring the auxiliary event as a bridge between RGB
and LiDAR modalities, and propose a novel hierarchical
visual-motion fusion framework for scene ﬂow, which can
explicitly fuse the multimodal knowledge to progressively
improve scene ﬂow from visual space to motion space.
•We reveal that RGB, event and LiDAR modalities have the
complementary knowledge in both visual homogeneous
(i.e., luminance and structure) and motion homogeneous
(i.e., correlation) spaces, which can make the entire multi-
modal fusion process more physically interpretable.
• We conduct extensive experiments on daytime and night-
time scenes, which verify that the VisMoFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance for all-day scene ﬂow.
2. Related Work
Unimodal Scene Flow Estimation. Since scene ﬂow is the
3D version of optical ﬂow, the previous scene ﬂow methods[3–7,11–13] mainly directly follow the optical ﬂow frame-
work [ 14,15]. They take monocular [ 5,16,17] or stereo
sequences [ 6,12] as input, and calculate cost volume with
warp operation through feature pyramid [ 18] or recurrent net-
work [ 14] for 3D motion. However, since 2D RGB images
lack the intrinsic 3D geometry property, LiDAR becomes
a trend in scene ﬂow estimation due to its 3D scene per-
ception capability. Most LiDAR-based scene ﬂow methods
[7,13,19,20] also follow the architecture of the optical ﬂow
framework, while the difference is that they use MLP or
voxel to represent the point cloud features. However, due to
the potential incomplete physical contour of LiDAR, these
single LiDAR-based scene ﬂow methods are still limited.
Instead, there is a strong complementarity between the two
modalities, which inspires us to fully exploit the cross-modal
complementary knowledge for scene ﬂow.
Multimodal Scene Flow Estimation. As unimodal scene
ﬂow methods provide the partial information, multimodal
fusion strategies [ 8,9,21,22] have gradually received atten-
tion. Liu et al. [9] proposed a bidirectional 2D-3D motion
feature fusion framework, which can exploit the comple-
mentary features between RGB and LiDAR. Wan et al. [22]
introduced the event camera to enhance the RGB and LiDAR
features in motion space via a cross-attention mechanism.
However, these methods may suffer the potential degraded
visual RGB features with weakened texture and limited vi-
sual LiDAR features with incomplete contour, thus leading
to a large modality gap and deteriorating the valid motion
features. In this work, we will introduce the auxiliary event
as a bridge to hierarchically enhance the RGB and LiDAR
features in both visual and motion spaces.
Multimodal Fusion. Multimodal fusion focuses on exploit-
ing the inter-modality complementarity for the target task.
To our knowledge, most existing multimodal fusion methods
learn the mutual knowledge between different modalities via
cross-attention mechanism [ 23–26] or similarity represen-
tation learning [ 27–30]. For example, Cai et al. [26] pro-
posed to utilize transformer [ 31] to directly fuse the proposal
features of RGB images and LiDAR for 3D object detec-
tion. However, these methods neglect the modality gap due
to the intrinsic heterogeneous nature of feature representa-
tion between various modalities, limiting the complementary
knowledge fusion. To alleviate this issue, we introduce an
auxiliary modality as the bridge to mitigate the modality gap,
and explore the homogeneous space to explicitly fuse the
cross-modal complementary knowledge for scene ﬂow.

on. However, there exists a modality gap due to the visual
intrinsic heterogeneous nature between RGB and LiDAR,
deteriorating motion features. To this end, we introduce the
auxiliary event as a bridge to mitigate the gap between RGB
and LiDAR, and propose a novel multimodal hierarchical
visual-motion fusion framework for scene ﬂow in Fig. 2. The
whole architecture looks complicated but is simply regarded
as a task that builds a homogeneous space to fuse the cross-
modal complementary knowledge for physical interpretation.
In visual luminance fusion, we transform the event and RGB
into the luminance space, and fuse the complementary (rel-
ative v.s. absolute) knowledge for high dynamic imaging
under the constraint of the similar spatiotemporal gradient.
In visual structure fusion, we represent the event and LiDAR
into the spatial structure space, and fuse the complementary
(local boundary v.s. global shape) knowledge for physical
structure integrity using the self-similarity clustering strat-
egy. In motion correlation fusion, we map the visual features
of RGB, event and LiDAR to the same correlation space,
and fuse the complementary (x, y-axis spatial-dense corre-
lation, x, y-axis temporal-dense correlation and x, y, z-axis
sparse correlation) knowledge for 3D motion spatiotempo-
ral continuity via motion distribution alignment. Under the
uniﬁed framework, the proposed method can explicitly fuse
the cross-modal complementary knowledge to progressively
improve scene ﬂow from visual space to motion space. Next,
we will describe the hierarchical visual-motion fusion frame-
work in the form of “what to fuse” and “how to fuse”.
3.2. Visual Luminance Fusion
Under oversaturated and low-light conditions, the RGB
image may loss the texture, thus mismatching the motionfeatures. The main reason is that RGB imaging mechanism
limits the dynamic range. Therefore, we introduce event
camera with the advantage of high dynamic range to assis-
tantly enhance the visual RGB features.
Relative v.s.Absolute Luminance. Event camera can asyn-
chronously capture the events triggered by the brightness
change, recording the relative luminance, while RGB camera
records the absolute luminance via global scan. Motivated
by this, we argue that event and RGB share the homoge-
neous luminance space, where the relative value of event and
the absolute value of RGB are complementary to each other.
Speciﬁcally, given the RGB image Iand the corresponding
event stream, we transform the RGB image into YUV color
space [IY;IU;IV], whereIYdenotes the luminance, IU,
IVis the chrominance information. We also accumulate the
event stream to generate the intensity frame:
IX=X
piC; (1)
wherepidenotes the event polarity. Cis the event trigger
threshold. Therefore, the absolute value IYfrom the RGB
image and the relative value IXfrom the event are comple-
mentary in the homogeneous luminance space. This makes
us naturally transform RGB and event into a uniﬁed lumi-
nance space to achieve complementary knowledge fusion.
Spatiotemporal Gradient Consistency. We set various
weights to fuse the absolute luminance of the RGB and the
relative luminance of the event as follows:
HY=W(IY;IX) = (!yIY+!xIX)=(!y+!x);(2)
where!x,!ydenote the weights of event and RGB, respec-
tively. The fused luminance image HYhas a high dynamic
range, but without color information. The color can be com-
pensated from U, V channels IU,IVof the input RGB

this equal and Eq. 2 as follows:
H=C(W(IY;IX);IU;IV): (3)
The fused YUV image Hshould be further inversely
transformed to the RGB color space. We follow [ 32] to
utilize the luminance fusion network to model the Eq. 3. We
take the adjacent RGB images [ It;It+t] at the timestamps
tandt+ t, and the corresponding event stream as input,
and output the fused RGB images [ ~It;~It+t]. Note that, the
fused images have two limitations: slightly unnatural color
appearance and potential motion discontinuity. To recover
the realistic color appearance, we force the adversarial loss

3.3. Visual Structure Fusion
LiDAR point cloud has the incomplete contour of the
scene due to a non-uniform laser beam, limiting the scene
ﬂow performance. We aim to introduce the event to assist in
completing the physical structure of the LiDAR point cloud.
Local Boundary v.s.Global Shape. LiDAR emits uniformlaser beams in the horizontal direction, and the reﬂected laser
can show the global shape of 360scene. However, LiDAR
just emits the non-uniform laser beams in the vertical direc-
tion due to the vertical angle. The larger the vertical angle,
the fewer the number of the reﬂected point cloud, resulting
in the incomplete contour of LiDAR. In contrast, event can
sense the rich motion boundaries of the scene. Therefore,
the local boundary of event and the global shape of LiDAR
can jointly complete the intrinsic structure of the scene. To
illustrate the complementary nature between LiDAR and
event in the structure space, as shown in Fig. 3, we cluster
the spatially-projected 2D LiDAR frame and the temporally-
projected 2D event frame into the same structure manifold,
and visualize the clustering feature distributions of LiDAR
and event. First, the distribution trend of LiDAR is similar
to the event. Second, the distribution of event boundary is
continuous while the distribution of LiDAR shape is trun-
cated, indicating that the contours of the 2D LiDAR frame
are incomplete but those of the 2D event frame are relatively
complete. This motivates us to take the scene structure as a
homogeneous space to fuse the local boundary of event into
the global shape of LiDAR for physical structure integrity.
Self-Similarity Clustering. Structure fusion mainly de-
pends on a self-similarity clustering strategy, which is di-
vided into two steps: intra-modal structure neighbor and
inter-modal data fusion. The former is to properly cluster
LiDAR shape points and event boundary points into the same
neighbor. The latter is to map the local boundary coordinates
of event to the global shape coordinates of LiDAR in the
neighbor, thus completing the physical contour. Given the
aligned LiDAR point cloud pc=fxi;yi;ziji2Mg, the cor-
responding event stream ev=fxj;yj;tj;pjjj2Ng, intrin-
sic parameter K=ff;cx;cyg, we ﬁrst normalize the event
stream along the timestamps to obtain the 2D coordinates of
eventPe=fuj=xj;vj=yj;pjjfxj;yj;pjg2evg, and
use the intrinsic parameter to project the LiDAR point cloud
into the event camera coordinate system Pl=fui;vi;dig:
ui=fxi=zi+cx;vi=fyi=zi+cy;di=zi;
s:t:fxi;yi;zig2pc;0<ui<w; 0<ui<h;(8)
wherew,his the size of event frame, fis focal length, cx,cy
are x, y-axis offsets. In the intra-modal structure neighbor
stage, we construct the distance function as the self-similarity
measurement metric for 2D coordinates of the event:
dp=q
(p1 p2)2;ds=q
(u1 u2)2+ (v1 v2)2;
De=q
d2p+ (ds=Ns)2;s:t:fu1;2;v1;2;p1;2g2Pe;(9)
whereNsis the max distance of 2D coordinates. We also
deﬁne the same distance function Dlfor the 2D coordinates
of LiDAR. We iteratively optimize the distance functions De,
Dlto obtain the neighbors U, which represent the region-
level structure information like the image superpixel. In the
inter-modal data fusion stage, we propose a similarity-based
bi-direction fusion strategy: event !LiDAR structure fusion

The three modalities have similar distributions in x, y-axis corre-

and LiDAR!event depth fusion. As for the event !LiDAR
structure fusion, we take the various 2D LiDAR coordinates
of each neighbor as the center, and use the K-nearest neigh-
bor to select the top k2D event coordinates with the highest
similarity and ﬁll them into the 2D LiDAR coordinates in
the same neighbor. As for the LiDAR !event depth fu-
sion, we ﬁlter the top k2D LiDAR coordinates in the same
way, and weightedly fuse their depths to the selected event
coordinates to obtain the ﬁnal depth map. To ensure the
back-propagation of the whole framework, we introduce a
cross-attention transformer [ 31] to model the visual struc-
ture fusion process between event and LiDAR. We use the
weighted-fused depth maps as the pseudo labels dpse

3.4. Motion Correlation Fusion
Visual luminance and structure fusions do ensure the
visualization of RGB and LiDAR, while how to physically
and complementarily fuse the mapped motion features of
various modalities to improve scene ﬂow is a challenge.
Spatiotemporal Dense v.s.Sparse Correlation. Motion
space that scene ﬂow relies on consists of two types: tempo-
ral correlation subspace [ 14] and decoded motion subspace[15]. The former is to model the feature similarity between
adjacent frames, and the latter contains the features decoded
by recurrent network ( e.g., GRU [ 34]). Since the correlation
subspace has more physical meaning, it has the potential to
be a homogeneous space. As far as we know, RGB provides
texture information with high spatial resolution, event pro-
vides boundary information with high temporal resolution,
and LiDAR provides 3D (x, y, z) scene structure information.
This inspires us to consider that, in the correlation space,
RGB may promise the x, y-axis spatial-dense correlation,
event may ensure the x, y-axis temporal-dense correlation
and LiDAR may guarantee the x, y, z-axis accurate but sparse
correlation. To verify our insight, as shown in Fig. 4, we
transform the visual RGB, event and LiDAR features into the
correlation subspace of motion space via warp operator [ 18],
and calculate their distributions in x, y, z three dimensions,
respectively. Note that, the correlation distribution of event
is analyzed along the timestamps. On one hand, the corre-
lation distribution trends of these three modalities are quite
similar along the x and y axes, with z-axis correlation unique
to LiDAR. On the other hand, in terms of the complementar-
ity in the correlation space, RGB is spatial-dense, event is
temporal-dense, and LiDAR is spatiotemporal-sparse. There-
fore, we treat the correlation space as a homogeneous space
to fuse the cross-modal knowledge for motion continuity.
Motion Distribution Alignment. Correlation fusion is ﬁrst
to fuse the dense-sparse complementary knowledge between
various modalities in the single-axis correlation, and then
merge the fused correlation distributions across all three axes.
First, we voxelize the event stream into multiple-slice vox-
els. We encode the fused RGB images, the voxelized events
and the fused LiDAR point clouds to the RGB correlation
cvr, the event correlation cveand the LiDAR correlation cvl
using the warp operator. Then, we randomly sample N3D
points from LiDAR. From these points, we obtain 2D coor-
dinates for RGB and event with intrinsic parameters. Next,
we use the sampled coordinates as the center, and perform
2D spatially-sampling for the RGB correlation to obtain the
corresponding spatial-dense x, y-axis correlations cvx
r,cvy
r.
As for the event, we temporally sample the correlation fea-
tures to get the temporal-dense x, y-axis correlations cvx
e,
cvy
e. For the LiDAR, we spatially sample the correlations
into the relatively sparse x, y, z-axis correlations cvx
l,cvy

motion feature encoder. The proposed motion correlation
fusion can ensure 3D motion spatiotemporal continuity.
3.5. Optimization and Implementation Details
Consequently, the total objective for the proposed hierar-
chical fusion framework is written as follows:
L=Lpho+1Ladv+2Lconsis +3Lpse+4Lkl
corr;(14)
where [1;:::; 4] are the weights that control the impor-
tance of the related losses. The ﬁrst term is to maintain
the capability of motion feature encoders of RGB, event
and LiDAR. The second and third terms are to constrain
the Event-RGB visual luminance fusion, the fourth term is
to promise that the cross-attention transformer can learn to
fuse the Event-LiDAR structure, and the intention of the
last term aims to promote the RGB-Event-LiDAR motion
correlation fusion. We set the KNN selection number kas 5,
the event temporal slices Tas 10, and the sample number N
as 1000. During the training phase, we only need three steps.First, we train Event-RGB visual luminance fusion for high
dynamic imaging. Second, we train Event-LiDAR visual
structure fusion for physical structure integrity. Finally, we
train RGB-Event-LiDAR motion correlation fusion for 3D
motion spatiotemporal continuity. Note that, the proposed
method is ﬁrst pre-trained to initialize the motion estimators
in a supervised manner. During the testing phase, the whole
framework consists of the luminance fusion network, the
cross-attention transformer and motion estimation networks,
thus achieving the end-to-end estimation of scene ﬂow.
4. Experiments
4.1. Experiment Setup
Dataset. We conduct extensive experiments on one syn-
thetic ( e.g., Event-KITTI) and one real ( e.g., DSEC) datasets,
including daytime and nighttime scenes.
Event-KITTI. The origin KITTI [ 37] is set in daytime
scenes. We take the V2E model [ 38] to generate the event
stream from daytime images, and use the noise model [ 39]
to synthesize nighttime images corresponding to daytime.
DSEC. DSEC is a multimodal dataset [ 40], which cov-
ers the multimodal data of RGB camera, LiDAR and event
camera in various outdoor scenes and various times.
Comparison Methods. We choose optical ﬂow and scene
ﬂow methods for comparison in both daytime and night-
time scenes. As for optical ﬂow comparison, we choose
unsupervised (SMURF [ 41]), supervised (FlowFormer [ 42]),
and multimodal fusion (RPEFlow [ 22]) methods. As for
scene ﬂow comparison, we choose RGB-based unimodal
(RAFT-3D [ 6]), LiDAR-based unimodal (PV-RAFT [ 7]),
RGB-LiDAR multimodal fusion (CamLiFlow [ 9]) and RGB-
Event-LiDAR multimodal fusion (RPEFlow) methods. Note
that, in nighttime scenes, we add an additional comparison:
ﬁrst performing image enhancement ( e.g., KinD++ [ 43]) and
then estimate motion on the enhanced results (named as “w/

e”). We choose the average end-point error (EPE [ 37]) and
the percentage of ﬂow accuracy within 1px for optical ﬂow
or 5cm for scene ﬂow (ACC [9]) as the evaluation metrics.
4.2. Comparison Experiment
Comparison on Synthetic Dataset. In Table 1 and Fig. 5,
we compare different motion methods on the synthetic Event-
KITTI dataset. First, the proposed method signiﬁcantly
outperforms the competing methods in optical ﬂow and scene
ﬂow. Second, in nighttime scenes, the performance of those
methods that use RGB images decreases slightly. Note that,
image enhancement can indeed promote the RGB-based
motion methods in nighttime scenes, but the improvement is
limited. Third, multimodal methods are more effective than
unimodal methods in improving motion estimation due to
the complementary knowledge between various modalities.
Notably, the proposed visual-motion fusion surpasses the
RPEFlow that relies solely on motion fusion.
Comparison on Real Scenes. In Table 2, we compare the
scene ﬂow methods in real daytime and nighttime scenes on
the DSEC dataset. We have two conclusions. First, multi-
modal methods are far superior to unimodal methods. This
is because the complementary knowledge of various modali-
ties in real scenes can make up for their own disadvantage,
conducive to deeply exploiting the characteristic of scene
ﬂow. Second, event camera can further effectively improve
nighttime scene ﬂow. The main reason is that, event camera
have the advantage of high dynamic range to sense scene
motion at night. In Fig. 6, our scene ﬂow visualization re-
sults show more complete structures and perform better than
other competing methods. The main reason is that, the visual
structure fusion does fuse the local boundary of event into
the global shape of LiDAR for point cloud physical integrity,
thus improving the matching capability of motion features.

4.3. Ablation Study
How does Hierarchical Visual-Motion Fusion Work? In
Table 3, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hi-
erarchical visual-motion fusion framework. With only visual
fusion, there is an improvement in scene ﬂow. With only
motion fusion, scene ﬂow is signiﬁcantly improved. When
we apply visual fusion and motion fusion, the hierarchical
fusion is superior to the motion fusion alone. Therefore,
motion fusion is the key to promoting scene ﬂow, and visual
fusion can update the upper limit of scene ﬂow performance.
The Role of homogeneous Space in Fusion. We illustrate
the impact of different homogeneous spaces on scene ﬂow
in Fig. 7. When only implicit feature fusion ( i.e., feature
concatenate (FC)), more errors of the scene ﬂow are caused
by feature mismatching. With visual luminance space (w/
FC+L), scene ﬂow is improved due to the enhanced visual
RGB features. Visual structure space (w/ FC+L+S) further
promotes the integrity of the scene ﬂow structure. With mo-
tion correlation space (w/ FC+L+S+C), the motion metric is
greater, and the scene ﬂow visualization is spatiotemporally
smoother. Therefore, the homogeneous space can serve as a
guide to physically facilitate the fusion process.
Effectiveness of Fusion Losses. In Table 4, we conduct
ablation studies on the main fusion losses. Without any fu-
sion losses, the whole framework still has the visual-motions
fusion process. Each loss improves scene ﬂow to a certain
extent, while the motion distribution alignment loss Lkl
corr
plays a key role in scene ﬂow. The three losses can jointly
promote the visual!motion progressive fusion process.

visual space, there exists a gap between RGB and LiDAR, while
event serves as a bridge across the two modalities. In (b) motion
space, the three modalities are further close to each other.
4.4. Discussion
How does Event Play the Bridge. In Fig. 8, we illustrate the
importance of event as a bridge between RGB and LiDAR
in visual and motion feature spaces via t-SNE. In the visual
space, there exists a large gap between RGB and LiDAR
features, while event features can just serve as a bridge
across the two modalities. When the fused visual features are
mapped to the motion space, the motion features of RGB and
LiDAR are close to each other and have a certain intersection,
which contains most of the event motion features. Therefore,
the event can reasonably bridge the RGB and LiDAR.
Effectiveness of Spatiotemporal Gradient Consistency.
We analyze the impact of spatiotemporal gradient consis-
tency on the Event-RGB fused image result and the optical
ﬂow result from the training process in Fig. 9. Without the
consistency loss, the training curve ﬂuctuates violently, the
fused RGB image looks clear while there are some artifacts
in the optical ﬂow. With the consistency loss, the ﬂuctuation
of the training curve is smoother, the fused RGB image is
also clear and the optical ﬂow boundaries become sharp.
This shows that spatiotemporal gradient consistency does
constrain the mapping relationship between the Event-RGB
fused visual features and the motion features.
Why Structure Neighbor is Necessary? Structure neighbor
is to extract the region-level structure from the pixel-level
structure, which has the local self-similarity characteristics.
In Table 5, without any neighbor, the scene ﬂow is slightly
limited. This is because the full pixel association between
event and LiDAR increases the probability of local-global
structure feature mismatching. With grid-based neighbor,
the scene ﬂow performance is improved but is lower than
the clustering-based neighbor. The main reason is that, theStructure neighbor strategy EPE ACC

the mapping relationship between the fused image and optical ﬂow.
grid-based neighbor may contain partial information of dif-
ferent objects, leading to the structure fusion bias, while the
clustering-based neighbor can reduce this error.
Limitation. The proposed method can indeed cope with the
all-day ( i.e., daytime and nighttime) scene ﬂow estimation,
but usually fails for adverse weather, such as rain and fog.
Rain will lead to varying degrees of dynamic streak noise to
RGB, event and LiDAR, and fog will attenuate atmospheric
light, limiting the imaging of these sensors. In the future,
we will further introduce the near-infrared sensor into these
modalities to handle adverse weather scene ﬂow.
5. Conclusion
In this work, we bring the event as a bridge between RGB
and LiDAR, and propose a novel hierarchical visual-motion
fusion framework to fuse the multimodal complementary
knowledge in the homogeneous space for scene ﬂow. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to investigate
the inter-modal homogeneous space to explicitly learn the
complementary knowledge for physical interpretation. We
construct the Event-RGB luminance space, Event-LiDAR
structure space and RGB-Event-LiDAR correlation space.
The three homogeneous spaces progressively improve scene
ﬂow from visual space to motion space. We also conduct
extensive experiments on daytime and nighttime scenes, and
verify the superiority of the proposed method. We believe
that the proposed method could not only facilitate the devel-
opment of scene ﬂow but also enlighten the researchers of
the broader ﬁeld, e.g., adverse scene multimodal perception.
