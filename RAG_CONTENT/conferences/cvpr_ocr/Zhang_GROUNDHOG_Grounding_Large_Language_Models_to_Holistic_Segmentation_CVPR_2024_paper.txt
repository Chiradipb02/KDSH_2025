Abstract
Most multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
learn language-to-object grounding through causal lan-
guage modeling where grounded objects are captured by
bounding boxes as sequences of location tokens. This
paradigm lacks pixel-level representations that are impor-
tant for fine-grained visual understanding and diagnosis.
In this work, we introduce GROUNDHOG , an MLLM de-
veloped by ground ing Large Language Models to ho listic
segmentation. GROUNDHOG incorporates a masked fea-
ture extractor and converts extracted features into visual
entity tokens for the MLLM backbone, which then con-
†Work done during internship at Amazon AGI.nects groundable phrases to unified grounding masks by re-
trieving and merging the entity masks. To train GROUND -
HOG, we carefully curated M3G2, a grounded visual in-
struction tuning dataset with M ulti-M odal M ulti-G rained
Grounding, by harvesting a collection of segmentation-
grounded datasets with rich annotations. Our experimental
results show that GROUNDHOG achieves superior perfor-
mance on various language grounding tasks without task-
specific fine-tuning, and significantly reduces object hallu-
cination. GROUNDHOG also demonstrates better ground-
ing towards complex forms of visual input and provides
easy-to-understand diagnosis in failure cases.

1. Introduction
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have re-
ceived an increasing amount of attention to address tasks
that necessitate non-linguistic knowledge, e.g., perception
and reasoning about the visual world [39, 84]. For fine-
grained visual understanding, grounded MLLMs often learn
language-to-object grounding by causal language modeling,
where grounded objects are captured by bounding boxes as
sequences of location tokens. However, bounding boxes
are insufficient in indicating amorphous stuff [5], seman-
tic parts of objects [23], finer-grained regions with irregular
shapes [26], or groups of instances at the same time. As a
result, a single bounding box can often include other irrel-
evant semantics in order to engulf the target entities, lead-
ing to ambiguity in detection. In addition, the generated
box coordinate lacks interpretability. When the model hal-
lucinates, such as incorrectly predicting the association be-
tween objects and language, it is hard to diagnose whether
the problem is due to the model’s failure to detect the object,
or its incorrect alignment of the object with language.
To address these issues, in this work, we introduce
GROUNDHOG , an MLLM developed by ground ing Large
Language Models to ho listic seg mentation. Our goal of lan-
guage grounding is to connect text spans that refer to or
can be deduced from visual information, termed as ground-
able phrases [50], to their corresponding regions of visual
entities (Figure 1). G ROUNDHOG incorporates a masked
feature extractor that takes an input image and a set of
class-agnostic entity mask proposals, and converts each
mask’s features into visual entity tokens for an MLLM
backbone. This MLLM then connects groundable phrases
to unified grounding masks by retrieving and merging the
entity masks. Compared to previous grounded MLLMs,
GROUNDHOG unlocks unprecedented pixel-level vision-
language alignment. It naturally supports visual point-
ers as input, and can plug-in-and-play with any choice of
mask proposal networks, e.g., Segment Anything Model
(SAM) [35], domain-specific semantic segmentation mod-
els, or user-provided mask candidates. We introduce an en-
hanced Mask2Former [10] as our default mask proposal net-
work, which detects regions at multiple granularities, e.g.,
instances (things and stuff), semantic parts, and visual text,
leading to a holistic coverage of visual semantics.
To train G ROUNDHOG , we curated a M ulti-M odal M ulti-
Grained G rounding (M3G2) dataset consisting of 2.5M
text-image pairs for visually grounded instruction tuning,
consisting of 36 sub-problems derived and augmented from
27 existing datasets. We present extensive experiments
on vision-language tasks that require grounding, including
grounded language generation with minimal object halluci-
nation, language-guided segmentation, visual question an-
swering with answer grounding, and referential dialog with
spatial pointer inputs (Figure 1). Our empirical results showthat G ROUNDHOG , without task-specific fine-tuning, can
achieve superior or comparable performance with previous
models that either require fine-tuning or are specialized only
for that dataset. In addition, G ROUNDHOG has supports
easy-to-understand diagnosis when grounding fails.
2. Our Method: G ROUNDHOG
The language grounding task can be succinctly delineated
into two fundamental components: localization andrecog-
nition, as established in the literature [50, 68,92]. Such
categorization not only aids in the identification of ob-
ject presence (objectness) without reliance on specific ob-
ject classes, but also sets the stage for models to be ro-
bust in open-vocabulary settings. Building upon this frame-
work, we formulate the grounding process as an entity seg-
ment selection problem, which involves (1) proposing en-
tity segmentation masks where the masks encapsulate re-
gions with discernible semantic content, and (2) recogniz-
ing the retrieved entities through the understanding of both
visual and language context. Concurrently performing both
tasks is where MLLMs bring a distinct advantage. This
decoupled design of entity mask proposal and language-
guided grounding brings several advantages. First, it al-
lows independent improvement of the mask proposal model
and MLLM, where specialized data, training, and infer-
ence setups can be applied. Second, by decoupling lan-
guage grounding, it becomes straightforward to determine
if a failure is due to the model’s inability to propose the
entity segment, or its misalignment of the object with the
language, thus improving the interpretability of the whole
framework. Third, as shown later, when connecting the two
parts to work in tandem in a model-independent manner, the
MLLM can benefit from multiple different vision specialist
models in a plug-and-play fashion. In the remainder of this
section, we give details of our model design.
2.1. Building Entity Features from Masks
Our approach assumes the availability of a mask proposal
model, which is capable of generating a set of class-
agnostic entity masks from an image with high coverage.
In contrast to prior studies that relied on low-level fea-
tures [8, 13,45,56], G ROUNDHOG interprets the image as a
collection of entities. The primary challenge then becomes
the derivation of effective visual features to accurately rep-
resent these entities. To achieve a complete decoupling of
the MLLM from the mask proposal model responsible for
providing the masks, we propose to condition the entity fea-
tures solely on the binary masks without using any embed-
dings from the mask proposal model. Specifically, the mask
corresponding to each entity is employed to extract patch
features from pretrained vision foundation models, such as
CLIP [62] and DINOv2 [54], through a convolutional mask
pooling layer [12]. Given that the feature map dimensions

first extracts the feature of each entity as the visual input of the multi-modal large language model (left). The output hidden states of the
grounding tokens are averaged and used to retrieve the entities to ground, which will be merged into a single grounding mask for the phrase.
Modules are colored by their trainability: parameter-free operators (grey), frozen (blue), trainable (orange), and partially trainable (mix).

are usually smaller than those of the mask proposals, we re-
size the masks to match the size of the feature maps prior to
pooling. The pooled features are then fed into a Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) network to align with the input embed-
dings of the MLLM. We empirically find the combination
of CLIP and DINOv2 features yields the best result, and
these features are added to obtain the final input visual en-
tity tokens to the MLLM.
Spatial Prompts Furthermore, for grounded MLLMs to
be more broadly applicable, they must be capable of inter-
preting multi-modal user inputs, including spatial prompts.
Thanks to the mask model agnostic design, G ROUND -
HOGcan seamlessly support such inputs. As demonstrated
in Figure 3, by applying an interactive segmentation model
such as Segment-Anything (SAM) [35], arbitrary spatial
prompts can be translated into binary masks and processed
by the same masked feature extractor we just introduced.
This extracted feature for the pointed entity will replace the
pointer token <PTR> placeholder in the textual input.2.2. Language Grounding to Entity Segmentation
Existing box-grounded MLLMs typically append location
tokens after the groundable phrases [8, 9, 56, 85]. However,
this method is not readily interpretable. To alleviate this dis-
connect, we introduce a pair of grounding tokens <GRD>
and</GRD> to indicate the start and end of groundable
phrases, with the assumption that grounding these phrases
requires mapping to certain representations of visual enti-
ties irrespective of the visual modality. In Figure 2, a sen-
tence can be represented as I see <GRD> two dogs
</GRD> on <GRD> the beach </GRD> , with two
distinct visual entities grounded. The representation of each
groundable phrase, termed as the grounding query , is ob-
tained by adding <GRD> and</GRD> ’s output embedding
from the last transformer layer of the MLLM. The repre-
sentation is then used to retrieve the entities that the phrase
should be grounded to. In particular, we concatenate the
grounding query with the last layer output of each visual
entity token, and use an MLP to predict a scalar score for
each entity. Finally, we merge all the mask proposals into
one single mask with pixel-wise maximization:
Mh,w= max
q
Sq·cMq,h,w
where Sqis the normalized score of the q-th mask ranging
from 0 to 1, and cMq,h,w denotes the pixel probability at
position (h, w)for the q-th mask. Note that a phrase may
ground to multiple entities, thus multiple mask proposals
may get a high score simultaneously and be selected in con-
junction. One of the primary benefits of this decoupled de-
sign is its transparency in the selection of entities. Users can
easily visualize both the mask proposals and their respective
14229
scores, providing a clear understanding of how a grounding
mask is predicted. This level of clarity and interpretability
is a significant advantage, offering users a tangible insight
into the model’s grounding process.
2.3. Towards Holistic Entity Mask Proposals
In order to support holistic language grounding to arbitrary
segmentations, the entity proposal should have two essen-
tial properties. First, the proposals should strike a delicate
balance in terms of semantic atomicity. While it is possi-
ble to merge multiple proposals later to form multi-entity
segmentations, the reverse, i.e., dividing a single proposal
into smaller segments, is not feasible. Therefore, instance
segmentation is generally preferred over semantic segmen-
tation. However, the segmentation should not be exces-
sively fine-grained to the extent that it compromises basic
semantic integrity. Over-segmentation can lead to a loss of
the coherent concept of an entity, which is detrimental to
the grounding process. Second, the entity proposals should
have a high coverage of entities, encompassing a diverse
range of granularities. This includes not only tangible ob-
jects (things) and amorphous concepts (stuff) but also ex-
tends to sub-components of objects (parts of things) and
structured regions such as areas containing visual text. The
ability to propose entities across this spectrum of granular-
ity is pivotal, as it directly determines the upper bound of
the grounding capability of MLLM.
We initiated our study with a Mask2Former model pre-
trained on the COCO panoptic segmentation dataset. How-
ever, preliminary experiments revealed its limitations in
semantic coverage and adaptability to open-world scenar-
ios. To enhance this, we developed Mask2Former+, an
upgraded version designed for multi-grained segmentation.
This upgrade involved creating a diverse dataset by merg-
ing annotations from various sources, including COCO [5],
LVIS [25], Entity-v2 [60], Pascal [16], PACO [63] (Fig-
ure7); MHP-v2 [40] for human part parsing; and Tex-
tOCR [67] for text segmentation. We expanded the model’s
capabilities by adding 50 expert queries each for seman-
tic parts and visual text regions, alongside the original 200
entity queries. We assessed Mask2Former+’s performance
on 1000 images from validation splits from 4 grounding
benchmarks, RefCOCO+ [86], PhraseCut [76], Reason-
Seg [37], and TextVQA-X [66]. We use the Any-IoU [30]
metric for evaluation, i.e., for each ground truth mask, we
extract the most overlapped mask proposals and compute
the IoU, then take the average. As Table 1demonstrates,
Mask2Former+ shows consistent improvements across all
domains, particularly in those significantly divergent from
COCO. This highlights its enhanced adaptability and pre-
cision in a broader range of segmentation challenges, pro-
viding a good mask proposal model for G ROUNDHOG . We

availability of Gr ounding Ann otations (B ox, M ask, and Po inter
inputs), the Sem antic Gran ularity (S tuff, Th ings, Pa rts, G roups,
and T ext), and the number of text-image pairs for training.
3. Our Dataset: M3G2
In this section, we introduce M3G2, a Multi-Modal Multi-
Grained Grounding dataset consisting of 2.5M text-image
pairs for visually grounded instruction tuning, consisting of
36 sub-problems derived and augmented from 27 existing
datasets. We re-organize and augment public datasets of
language grounding, visual question answering, referring
expression segmentation, and referring expression genera-
tion into various forms of visually grounded dialogue for
grounded instruction tuning, outlined briefly in Table 2. The
dataset is categorized into four main types: (1) Grounded
Image Captioning (GIC), (2) Referential Expression Seg-
mentation (RES), (3) Grounded Visual Question Answer-
14230
ing (GVQA), and (4) Referential Dialog (RD). We provide
illustrated descriptions of our prompt design, accompanied
by examples of each task type as depicted in Figure 4. We
detail the task schema in the following sections and provide
the complete sets of templates in Appendix B.
3.1. Grounded Image Captioning (GIC)
The task of grounded image captioning requires the model
to produce a narrative for the visual scene, and accurately
identify and associate the groundable phrases with their re-
spective binary segmentation masks. The objective of this
task is to empower the model to articulate the scene while
acknowledging various visual elements and their spatial in-
terrelations. We incorporate the Panoptic Narrative Ground-
ing (PNG) dataset [34] for dense and detailed scene descrip-
tions, as well as the Flickr30K-Entity dataset [58] for con-
cise descriptions of the salient contents in the image. We
create a collection of task prompt templates that instruct the
model to describe the image either in detail or briefly.
3.2. Referring Expression Segmentation (RES)
In contrast to previous tasks, the referring expression seg-
mentation task requires that the model generates a segmen-
tation mask based on a given referring expression. Besides
the RefCOCO series [43, 52,86], we have further lever-
aged existing RES benchmarks [37, 65,76,78,79] for this
purpose. As shown in Figure 4, we instruct the model to
localize the referred objects, with the expected output be-
ing a repetition of the referring expression whose grounding
mask is the target object.
3.3. Grounded Visual Question Answering (GVQA)
The task of grounded visual question answering requires
the model to comprehend a question (with optional point-
ers) and to produce an answer that is grounded to a binary
segmentation mask that justifies the answer. The goal of this
task is to enable natural QA-based interaction with users
and reasoning in the model with grounded explanations.
Specifically, we harvest and adapt a collection of public
VQA datasets with grounding annotations [6, 8,19,29], QA
benchmarks on visual text [64], and create templated QA
pairs from segmentation datasets [25, 60]. Our prompt tem-
plates instruct the model to respond either as open-ended
answers or by selecting from multiple choices, with the re-
sponse anchored to a segmentation mask (Figure 4).
3.4. Referential Dialogue (RD)
The task of referential dialogue requires the model to con-
duct dialogue communication with users, especially when
conditioned on user-provided spatial prompts. This in-
cludes existing RD datasets [8, 51,88,90,94], multi-turn
augmentations from segmentation datasets [17, 36,47] as
well as the referring expression generation (REG) task the

RefCOCO series [43, 52,86]. The REG task differs from
the region captioning task in that it demands the description
to be a referring expression that distinctly identifies the tar-
geted object. Effective REG calls for the model to engage in
dialogue interactions cooperatively, adhering to the Gricean
Maxims [24] which dictate that communication should be
as informative, truthful, relevant, and clear as necessary.
4. Experiment and Analysis
We adopt the LLaMA2-7B model [70] as our base LLM,
and initialized the weight from LLaV A-1.5 [44]. For the
vision encoders, we use the OpenAI CLIP@336 [62] model
and DINOv2-L/14-reg [15] pretrained checkpoints. Please
refer to Appendix Cfor more implementation details.
4.1. Generalist in Grounded Vision-Language Tasks
We first demonstrate G ROUNDHOG ’s capabilities as a gen-
eralist model for three different types of grounded vision-
language tasks. It’s worth noting that, unlike previous work
that needs dataset-specific fine-tuning on each of the tasks,
GROUNDHOG can achieve comparable performance on all
the tasks directly after training on M3G2, i.e., all the re-
ported results from our model are from a single set of
weights without any dataset-specific fine-tuning.
Language Grounding To Segmentation. We start by
evaluating the model on language grounding tasks, which
takes text as input and generates segmentation masks as out-
put. We assess G ROUNDHOG on Referential Expression
Segmentation (RES) [32] and Caption Phrase Grounding
(CPG) tasks. While traditional RES benchmarks [32, 53]
focus on single-instance referents requiring primarily visual
understanding, we expanded our evaluation to include com-
plex scenarios involving multi-instance or negative queries

[43, 76], and those necessitating common sense reason-
ing [37, 61]. The results in Table 3show G ROUNDHOG out-
performing the generalist model LISA across all bench-
marks and achieving significant improvements over special-
ist models in multi-instance, null, and reasoning-based RES
tasks. It also performs comparably on the competitive Re-
fCOCO series. For CPG tasks, which involve grounding
all phrases in a caption and demand a deep understanding
of the context for coreference resolution, we first evaluated
GROUNDHOG on the Flickr30K-Entity dataset [58]. Since
this dataset only has box annotations, we convert the mask
predictions of our model to box and compute the top-1 box
recall following the merged-box protocol [30]. Despite not
specializing in predicting boxes, G ROUNDHOG still outper-
forms Shikra 7B/13B [8] and is on par with Ferret-7B [85]
in a concurrent work (Table 4). Additionally, on the PNG
dataset [34] which tests phrase grounding in longer narra-
tives, G ROUNDHOG surpasses the previous state-of-the-art
model, PiGLET [22], in all metrics including average recall
of grounding masks and detailed scores for things, stuffs,
and singular and plural entities (Table 5).

such as Bleu-4 [55], METEOR [4], CIDEr [72], and

grounding accuracy following You et al. [85]. As shown
in Table 8, G ROUNDHOG significantly surpasses existing
box-based grounded MLLMs, even their 13B versions, in
both language quality and grounding accuracy. This im-
provement is hypothesized to stem from the diverse task
distribution in our M3G2 dataset. For groundable ques-
tion answering, we evaluate on the TextVQA-X bench-
mark [64]. G ROUNDHOG outperforms the state-of-the-art
specialist model SAB [33] by a significant margin, as mea-
sured by the mean IoU of the predicted mask (Table 6).
Spatial Prompt Understanding. For grounded MLLMs,
accurately interpreting multimodal instructions is essen-
tial, particularly in interactive tasks. We evaluated
its performance on two pointer-based QA benchmarks,
PointerQA Twice [51] and V7W [94], which require the
model to answer questions guided by spatial prompts, such
as bounding boxes. The model is tasked to generate free-

multiple-choice options in V7W. G ROUNDHOG demon-
strates superior performance in these benchmarks, outper-
forming previous models as shown in Table 7. This high-
lights its effectiveness in spatial understanding and response
accuracy. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of using
SAM for the pointer-to-mask conversion, we show the best-
matched mask proposal from our Mask2Former+ model in
comparison to the mask from SAM in Figure 5. While
the best match proposal from the Mask2Former+ model in-
cludes a broader area, the SAM-generated mask offers a
more precise representation of the specified region, poten-
tially leading to a more accurate caption.
4.2. Trustworthiness and Transparency
Beyond its superior performance as a grounding general-
ist, we highlight two key improvements for creating a more
trustworthy and transparent agent.
Reduced Object Hallucination. Thanks to the varied
task distribution and the inclusion of negative question-
answering samples in M3G2 dataset, G ROUNDHOG signifi-
cantly reduces object hallucination. We assessed this using
the POPE [42] benchmark, which includes binary questions
about object existence across three splits, each with a dif-
ferent object distribution (with an order of difficulty Ran-
dom<Popular <Adversarial ). Remarkably, G ROUND -Model

HOG consistently outperforms other models in both accu-
racy and F1 score across all splits, particularly on the more
challenging ones. It shows an absolute improvement of
5.2% in accuracy for Popular and 4.0% for Adversarial over
the previously best-performing model. This suggests that
our model’s enhanced grounding capability plays a signifi-
cant role in mitigating the object hallucination problem.
Explainability and Diagnosability. Another important
highlight of G ROUNDHOG is its enhancement of explain-
ability through the decoupled design of entity proposal and
selection, as outlined earlier in section 2.2. This is exem-
plified in the case study illustrated in Figure 6, which il-
lustrates the mask proposal scoring and selective merging
process of our model. We show the top-4 masks, where the
higher-score masks are labeled in green while the lower-
score masks are labeled in red. Users can easily interpret
that the failure is due to the incapability of MLLM to rec-
ognize the word “KWIK”, despite it being successfully lo-
calized and proposed as an entity candidate.
4.3. Ablation Studies
We performed ablation studies to validate our design deci-
sions, training, and evaluating a subset of the M3G2 dataset
that includes RefCOCO+, Flickr30K, and TextVQA. These
cover a range of visual entities from various image
sources and granularities. We start by comparing our
Mask2Former+ with the original Mask2Former for mask
proposal effectiveness. As indicated in Table 10, the orig-

inal Mask2Former performs slightly better on RefCOCO,
as it is developed specificity on COCO object categories.
However, Mask2Former+ significantly surpasses the orig-
inal in domains with non-COCO entities. Our second set
of experiments examined the choice of visual entity fea-
tures. Although using either CLIP or DINOv2 features
alone shows advantages in specific datasets, their combina-
tion consistently yields the best results across all datasets.
To obtain a robust grounding query representation, we ex-
perimented with using the output embedding of the <GRD>
token, the </GRD> token, and their sum. We found that
the latter approach achieves the best overall results. Finally,
we demonstrate that our decoupling design of the mask pro-
posal model and MLLM allows for training at a lower reso-
lution (320px) to expedite grounding training, while scaling
up the resolution during evaluation enhances performance.
5. Related Work
Multimodal Large Language Models. Building on the
recent advance of large language models (LLMs), there is
an increasing effort in adapting pretrained large language
models for multimodal tasks, such as understanding and
interpreting visual information [1, 71]. More recently, vi-
sual instruction tuning has gained much interest due to its
surprising performance with a modest amount of data and
computing resources. Various models have been developed,
noticeably MiniGPT4[93] , LLaV A [44, 45] and concurrent
models [13, 20,38,74,83]. Despite their promising per-
formances, MLLMs often produce objects that are not pre-
sented in the given images, a phenomenon referred to as the
object hallucination problem [14, 31,42].
MLLM with Language Grounding The ability to con-
nect language to their corresponding visual elements in
the physical world, known as grounding [27], is crucial
in everyday human communication about our shared sur-roundings. Grounding datasets have been shown to ben-
efit vision-language pre-training, both in terms of object-
level recognition [41] and language learning [50]. Re-
cent works unify text and grounding regions into token se-
quences [49, 73,81] in casual language modeling. Based
on such paradigm, researchers have developed a family
of grounded MLLM, including GPT4ROI [89], Kosmos-
2 [56], Shikra [8], PVIT [7], BuboGPT [91], Qwen-VL [3],
and Ferret [85]. Despite their promising performance, these
models focus on object grounding to bounding boxes, which
cannot handle pixel-level grounding across various seman-
tic granularities. Furthermore, it lacks the diagnosability
and explainability in failure cases. Our model fills this gap.
Language-Guided Semantic Localization The field of
language-guided semantic localization has a long history
in the vision-language research community, requiring that
the model localize a given referring expression with bound-
ing boxes or segmentation masks. This task has evolved
from early attempts to understand simple referring expres-
sions within images, such as the well-known RefCOCO se-
ries [52, 86] and their generalized variant [43] that takes
no-target and multi-target into account. The integration of
advanced language reasoning from LLMs has enabled re-
search to tackle even more nuanced reasoning tasks that
involve complex language contexts [37, 57,87]. Notably,
LISA [37] formulates a reasoning segmentation task to
bring language-informed reasoning into semantic segmen-
tation, and contributes a powerful baseline. Our model
builds on these developments, but is designed to be more
universally applicable as a grounded MLLM.
6. Conclusion
In this study, we introduce G ROUNDHOG , a novel frame-
work designed to enable pixel-level explainable grounding
in large language models, leveraging holistic segmentation.
The system builds upon a pre-trained mask proposal net-
work to provide pixel-level visual features for the large lan-
guage models, allowing them to retrieve segmentation mask
proposals that can be used for grounding. We also present
M3G2, a dataset of 1.9M training text-image pairs with 36
sub-problems derived from 27 existing datasets for visu-
ally grounded instruction tuning, facilitating precise vision-
language alignment at the pixel level. We show that af-
ter training on M3G2, G ROUNDHOG achieves superior per-
formance on various grounding tasks. Through extensive
case studies, we further show that G ROUNDHOG unlocks
explainability and diagnosability, and demonstrates better
grounding towards occluded objects, groups of multiple in-
stances, amorphous background regions, semantic parts of
objects, and objects with irregular shapes.
