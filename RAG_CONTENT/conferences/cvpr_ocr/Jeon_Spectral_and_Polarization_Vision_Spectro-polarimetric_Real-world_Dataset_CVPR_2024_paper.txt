Abstract
Image datasets are essential not only in validating exist-
ing methods in computer vision but also in developing newmethods. Many image datasets exist, consisting of trichro-matic intensity images taken with RGB cameras, which are
designed to replicate human vision. However , polariza-tion and spectrum, the wave properties of light that animals
in harsh environments and with limited brain capacity of-ten rely on, remain underrepresented in existing datasets.Although there are previous spectro-polarimetric datasets,they have insufﬁcient object diversity, limited illumination
conditions, linear-only polarization data, and inadequate
image count. Here, we introduce two spectro-polarimetricdatasets, consisting of trichromatic Stokes images and hy-perspectral Stokes images. These datasets encompass bothlinear and circular polarization; they introduce multiplespectral channels; and they feature a broad selection of
real-world scenes. With our dataset in hand, we analyze
the spectro-polarimetric image statistics, develop efﬁcientrepresentations of such high-dimensional data, and evalu-ate spectral dependency of shape-from-polarization meth-ods. As such, the proposed dataset promises a foundationfor data-driven spectro-polarimetric imaging and vision re-search.
1. Introduction
Recent progress in computer vision can be largely attributedto comprehensive studies of real-world image datasets, such
as ImageNet [ 14]. Foundation models [ 1,35,53,64] fur-
ther underscore data signiﬁcance. Most of these datasetscomprise trichromatic intensity images, inspired by humanvisual perception, enabling machines to emulate human vi-sion with trichromatic RGB cameras. As such, the datasetshave facilitated the development of low-cost, camera-based
autonomous agents capable of perceiving and interacting

ples include textureless surface, low-albedo objects, and
transparent materials.
Light possesses wave properties, including polarization
and spectrum [ 9], which are not faithfully captured by
trichromatic intensity imaging. While these properties areinvisible to human, animals like honeybees and ants lever-age the polarization and spectrum for navigation and othertasks. Horvath and Varju [ 25] provide diverse examples
and mechanisms of spectral and polarimetric vision in an-imals. Partly drawing inspiration from nature, researchershave extended the analysis of spectrum and polarizationto a variety of ﬁelds, including computer vision, robotics,and astronomy. This has spurred interest in polarimet-ric [7,8,38,49] and hyperspectral imaging [ 2,10,28], and
more recently, their integration into spectro-polarimetricimaging [ 3,17,18,23,26,45,47,50,54,67]. Prior work
using spectro-polarimetric images has shown potential for
skin analysis [ 67], vegetation classiﬁcation [ 63], shape re-
construction [ 27], object recognition [ 13], and segmenta-
tion [ 30,55].
There are existing spectro-polarimetric datasets, summa-
rized in Figure 2, that have been invaluable for these anal-
ysis [ 19,38,39,52] and training neural networks [ 4,11,
22,36,40–42,46,48]. However, these datasets unfortu-
nately do not capture the diversity of real-world spectro-polarimetric images as effectively as their trichromatic in-
tensity counterparts do. They typically suffer from limitedobject, scene, and illumination diversity, contain primarilylinear polarization information, and offer a small number
of images. To advance the ﬁeld, we propose a comprehen-sive spectro-polarimetric dataset that encompasses: (1) Full
Stokes polarimetric data , including both linear and circu-
lar polarization states, represented by Stokes vectors [ 9] for
each pixel and wavelength. (2)
A diverse range of spectral
channels , facilitating in-depth exploration of the interplay
between spectrum and polarization. (3) A broad array of

real-world scenes , crucial for extracting meaningful statis-
tics and relationships within spectro-polarimetric images.
To this end, we introduce two spectro-polarimetric
datasets designed to cover real-world spectro-polarimetric
scenes: a trichromatic Stokes dataset consisting of 2,022images, and a hyperspectral Stokes dataset containing 311images across 21 spectral channels. The trichromaticStokes dataset covers a wider range of scenes thanks to itsconvenient capture setup and process. The hyperspectral
Stokes dataset provides richer spectral-polarimetric infor-mation than the trichromatic Stokes dataset. Both datasets
cover a variety of natural indoor and outdoor scenes.Each image in these datasets is annotated with four spe-ciﬁc parameters: the type of environment (indoor or out-door), the illumination conditions (clear/cloudy sunlight orwhite/yellow ofﬁce light), the timestamp of capture, and thescene categorization (either object- or scene-oriented).
Utilizing these datasets, we systematically analyze the
statistics of real-world spectro-polarimetric images. We fo-cus on examining statistics of Stokes vectors, in additionto the gradients and polarimetric attributes associated withthem. We also conduct an analysis of unpolarized and po-larized images derived through polarimetric decomposition.We then develop two efﬁcient spatio-spectral-polarimetric
representations using principal component analysis (PCA)and implicit neural representation (INR). These representa-tions exhibit effective denoising capabilities and low mem-
ory footprints by exploiting the compressible structure ofspectro-polarimetric images. We also analyze the im-pact of intensity denoising for spectro-polarimetric images,
spectral dependency of shape-from-polarization methods,and environment dependency on the statistics of spectro-
polarimetric images.
In summary, we make the following contributions.
• We introduce a trichromatic Stokes dataset and a hy-
perspectral Stokes dataset, featuring 2,333 diverse anno-tated indoor and outdoor scenes under various illumina-tion conditions, which encompasses full-Stokes polariza-
tion data for linear and circular states.
• We develop efﬁcient spatio-spectral-polarimetric repre-
sentations and analyze real-world spectro-polarimetricimages, encompassing Stokes vectors and their gradients,unpolarized and polarized images, shape from polariza-tion, denoising, and environment dependency.

infrared spectral band, albeit only on 10 objects. Fan et
al. [19] acquire the ﬁrst multi-spectral full-Stokes polari-
metric dataset covering linear and circular states, while itonly contains 64 ﬂat objects captured in a lab environment.Our proposed datasets enables analyzing the statistics ofreal-world spectro-polarimetric images, which cannot beachieved by prior datasets. See Figure 2for a comprehen-
sive comparison.
Applications of Spectro-polarimetric Imaging Spectro-
polarimetric information has been investigated for diversevision and imaging tasks. Using linear-polarization images
has found applications in shape reconstruction [ 4,5,7,16,
21,31,41,70], appearance acquisition [ 15,36], removing
reﬂections [ 37,40,46,51,59,62], transparent-object seg-
mentation [ 33,48], seeing through scattering [ 20,43,68],
and image enhancement [ 69]. Trichromatic Stokes im-
ages have been used for tone-mapping [ 12] and seeing
through scattering [ 6]. Expanding into multi-spectral do-
main, spectral-polarimetric analysis has been applied to ob-ject recognition [ 13], skin analysis [ 67], dehazing [ 61],
specular reﬂection inpainting [ 29], background segmenta-
tion [ 30] and tensor representation [ 65]. In addition to
vision tasks, spectro-polarimetric imaging has been usedfor various biological applications, such as marsh vegeta-tion classiﬁcation [ 63], coastal wetland classiﬁcation [ 55]
and leaf nitrogen determination [ 44]. While the aforemen-
tioned studies demonstrate the beneﬁts of using spectro-polarimetric data, we believe that the full potential ofspectro-polarimetric images is still locked by the absenceof real-world spectro-polarimetric datasets.

4. Spectro-polarimetric Dataset
We introduce a trichromatic Stokes dataset comprising
2,022 Stokes images and a hyperspectral Stokes dataset
with 311 Stokes images at 21 spectral channels. Bothdatasets cover natural real-world indoor and outdoor scenes.Each Stokes image is accompanied by four labels: (1)the environment (indoor or outdoor), (2) the illuminationcondition, including clear or cloudy sunlight and white
or incandescent light, (3) the time of image capture, (4)
the scene type, distinguishing between object-oriented andscene-oriented. Figure 2shows thumbnails, statistics, and
comparison of our datasets to existing ones. Prior datasetssuffer from a narrow range of scenes, restricted illuminationconditions, linear polarization only, and fewer images.
Acquisition We acquire the datasets using two imaging
systems depicted in Figure 3(a), proposed and developed
by previous studies [ 34,56]. First, the trichromatic Stokes
camera by Tu et al. [ 56] incorporates on-sensor quarter-
wave plates (QWPs) and linear polarizers (LPs) [ 9]. This al-
lows for single-shot capture of trichromatic Stokes images,enabling convenient data collection on diverse scenes. The

the hyperspectral Stokes camera from Kim et al. [ 34] cap-
tures images by sequentially scanning 21 spectral channelsfrom 450 nm to 650 nm in 10 nm increments with a LCTFwhich functions as a LP. For each spectral channel, we cap-ture images by rotating a QWP. The resolution of a hy-perspectral Stokes image is 512(height)×612(width)×
4(Stokes elements) ×21(wavelengths).
Spectro-polarimetric Image Formation Using the two
imaging systems, we capture raw images from which a
per-pixel Stokes vector for each spectral channel is recon-structed. We introduce an uniﬁed image formation modelthat can be applied to both cameras. Suppose a light raywith a Stokes vector s
λat wavelength λimpinges on a
Stokes camera. As the light passes through polarization ﬁl-
ters modeled by the Mueller matrix M(Θ), its Stokes vector
transforms. Θdenotes the polarization-ﬁlter conﬁguration.
The camera sensor then captures light intensity, representedby the ﬁrst element of the Stokes vector. The recorded in-tensity,I
c(Θ), at a spectral channel cand polarimetric ﬁlter
conﬁguration Θ, is described by

For a spectral channel c,Mcis the Mueller matrix of the

For the hyperspectral Stokes camera, we use four conﬁgu-

gives four/eight conﬁgurations for the (red, blue) channels
and the green channel, respectively.
Figure 3(c) shows the reconstructed Stokes images. A
Stokes vector is physically-valid if DoP meets the follow-ing inequality: 0≤ρ≤1. 99% of the reconstructed
Stokes vectors in our datasets satisfy this condition. Forthe following analysis, we ﬁlter out Stokes vectors violat-ing the DoP condition and the unstable Stokes vectors re-
constructed from saturated/underexposed pixel intensity.
5. Dataset Analysis
Noise and Intensity Denoising Spectro-polarimetric im-
ages are susceptible to noise due to the low-light through-put of spectral and polarimetric ﬁlters. Our datasets are not
exempt from these issues. To assess noise in Stokes im-ages, we capture and average 100 images of a scene shown

these averaged images, we reconstruct pseudo ground-truth
Stokes image, shown in Figure 5(a). Figure 5(b) reports
the MSE and PSNR of reconstructed Stokes images withrespect to the number of averaged images. To achieve aPSNR exceeding 35 dB, we need to average over 4/25 shots
for the trichromatic/hyperspectral Stokes cameras, indicat-ing lower SNR of the hyperspectral Stokes dataset. Weﬁnd that state-of-the-art learning-based intensity denois-ing methods, such as KBNet [ 66], can effectively reduce
noise for each polarization conﬁguration, leading to accu-rate Stokes-vector reconstruction, despite lack of polariza-tion images during training. For the denoised single-shotcapture, we achieve a PSNR of 34.5 dB, demonstrating thepotential of using pretrained intensity restoration networksfor Stokes imaging. Figure 5(c) shows PSNRs of recon-
structed Stokes images per each spectral channel and nor-malized Stokes element. With the intensity denoising, weﬁnd that the PSNR signiﬁcantly increases for s
1,s2, ands3.
Efﬁcient Spatio-spectral-polarimetric Representations
Each pixel in a hyperspectral Stokes image contains aStokes vector for every spectral channel, leading to a totalof21×4×32bits using single-precision ﬂoating format.
This results in a bit-per-pixel (BPP) value of 2,688, equat-ing to 100 MB for storing a single hyperspectral Stokes im-age of512×612 pixels. Given the substantial memory
required to store a spectro-polarimetric image, we investi-gate efﬁcient representations of real-world spatio-spectral-polarimetric data, for which we explore two methods: aPCA-based model and an implicit neural model.
First, we apply PCA on non-overlapping hyperspectral
Stokes patches. Figure 4(a) shows the 40 most signiﬁcant
22102
PCA bases, revealing varied spatial and spectral features
for each Stokes element: s0,s1,s2,s3. Notably, spatial
structures are more evident in s0, whiles1,s2,s3shows
spectral features, suggesting a stronger correlation betweenspectrum and polarization than spatial features. To visual-ize hyperspectral intensity, we convert it to sRGB, whichmeans that the same sRGB color may originate from dif-ferent spectra. Figure 4(c) shows the variance of the coef-
ﬁcients for the top 200 PCA bases, indicating that spatio-spectral-polarimetric data can indeed be compressed. Thisis further evidenced by Figure 4(d), which shows the re-
construction error and BPP when varying number of PCAbases used to recreate a hyperspectral Stokes image. Using
2.22 MB coefﬁcients adequately represents a 100 MB hy-perspectral Stokes image as shown in Figure 4(b), exhibit-
ing a high compression rate with the reconstruction error of2.69×10
−5. See the Supplemental Document for further
details on PCA analysis.
Second, we devise an INR for hyperspectral Stokes im-
ages by modifying NeSpoF [ 34]. The original NeSpoF ar-
chitecture models a volumetric hyperspectral Stokes ﬁeld.Here, instead, we aim to represent a hyperspectral Stokesimage. Speciﬁcally, our INR, modeled by an MLP F
γ, out-
puts the Stokes vector sfor a given pixel position px,pyand
spectral channel index c, that is
s=Fγ(px,py,c), (5)
whereγis the network parameters. We ﬁt the MLP to a
hyperspectral Stokes image by minimizing the reconstruc-tion loss between the network output and the hyperspectralStokes image. The training curve is shown in Figure 4(e).
Figure 4(f) shows the reconstruction error and BPP of our
INR with respect to varying number of the MLP layers.With just 8 layers corresponding to a BPP of 60, we achievea converged reconstruction error of 1.90×10
−5, resulting in
just 2.22 MB of network parameters to represent a 100 MB
hyperspectral Stokes image. See Supplemental Documentfor architecture details.
Both PCA and INR experiments validate that a natu-
ral spectro-polarimetric image is compressible. PCA pro-
vides PCA basis vectors that can be applied to any instance,
however with a lower reconstruction accuracy than INR.INR is overﬁtted to a single instance, while higher recon-struction accuracy can be achieved. These representationsare also beneﬁcial for denoising spectral-polarimetric im-ages, as shown in Figure 4(b), which even outperforms the
learning-based intensity denoiser [ 66].

larized light. Note that the polarized image typically en-
codes the illumination colors for dielectric surfaces. Fig-ure6(b) reveals that the intensity distributions of polarized
light, obtained from the entire hyperspectral Stokes dataset,is skewed towards low and high-intensity values comparedto the unpolarized light. This is because polarized imagesmostly contain specular reﬂections, which is sparsely dis-tributed and has high intensity values. We then computethe variance of the PCA bases for polarized intensity alongthe spectral channel. Figure 6(c) highlights that the spectral
variance for polarized intensity is lower than that of unpo-
larized intensity. We speculate that the color of polarized
light lies in a lower dimensional space than that of unpo-larized light, since diffuse reﬂection with diverse spectralvariations is mostly captured by unpolarized light, makingthe spectral variation of unpolarized light more pronounced.
Stokes V ector Distributions in Natural Stokes Images
Next, we analyze the distribution of all Stokes vectors inour Stokes dataset. Figure 7shows the histograms of Stokes
elements s

This indicates that pixels are often more linearly polarizedthan circularly polarized. Refer to the Supplemental Docu-ment for further analysis.
Gradient Analysis of Stokes Images Gradient distribu-
tion of images has been often used as priors for image-based applications including image restoration, understand-ing, and editing. Here, we perform gradient analysis ofStokes and polarization-feature images. Figure 8(b) shows
that the gradient of Stokes and normalized Stokes vectorsexhibits a similarity to Hyper-Laplacian priors, commonlyused to describe the gradient of natural intensity-images.An interesting ﬁnding is that total intensity s
0has more
high-gradient values than the linear components of s1and
s2, and the circular component s3has the lowest-value dis-
tribution.
We analyze the gradient distributions of polarization fea-
tures, including AoLP, degree of linear polarization (DoLP),degree of circular polarization (DoCP), and CoP. DoLPand DoCP are computed as DoLP =/radicalbig

2/s0and
DoCP = |s3|/s0respectively. To compute the gradient of
AoLP images, we consider the angular wrapping property.That is, AoLP has a range from −

2and the AoLPs of
−π
2andπ
2are identical. Thus, if the gradient exceedsπ
2,
we estimate the gradient as ∇AoLP−π×sign(∇AoLP),
where∇is the gradient operator and sign is the sign
operator that returns 1if positive, otherwise −1. Fig-
ure8(c) shows that the gradients of AoLP are generally
higher than DoLP and DoCP. This implies that sparsity inthe measurement gradient is milder for AoLP than DoLP
and DoCP. DoLP and DoCP have shapes similar to Hyper-Laplacian priors while DoCP is sharper than DoLP. TheGradient

gradient of CoP shows symmetric distributions for right-
circular and left-circular directions. Unlike AoLP, the prob-ability decreases as the gradient approaches extreme values.
The difference in tendency between linear-polarization andcircular-polarization features, as well as their distributions,means that we need distinct priors for each polarization fea-ture, emphasizing the importance of a full Stokes dataset
that measure not only linear but also circular polarization.
Shape from Polarization and Spectral Channels Meth-
ods that recover shape from polarization, SfP, have maderapid progress in the last decade. SfP aims to extract
normals by analyzing the normal-dependent polarizationchange of reﬂected light. Speciﬁcally, SfP analyzes the DoPand AoLP based on Fresnel theory [ 9], which describes
the polarization change of light upon reﬂection and trans-
mission at a smooth surface [ 32,41]. Here, we analyze
an overlooked problem in SfP: the spectral dependency ofestimated normals. Surface normals, as a geometric sur-

face property, should be consistent regardless of the input
spectral channels used for SfP. In Figure 9, we test the
state-of-the-art SfP method by Lei et al. [ 41], designed for
in-the-wild scenes. The evaluation results on our normal-
ized Stokes dataset clearly reveal that normal maps recon-
structed from different spectral channels exhibit variations.We compute the standard deviations of spectral variationsfor eachx,y, andzcomponent of the estimated normals.
Figures 9(e) and (f) show the probability distributions of the
standard deviation, highlighting the large variations in theestimated normals for both hyperspectral and trichromaticdatasets. Interestingly, the xandycomponents of normals
show larger standard deviations than the zcomponent. This
implies that the spectral variation of DoP, which determinesthezcomponent, has less impact on the distribution than
that of AoLP, which governs the xandycomponents.

three data labels: Indoor ,Sunlight and Cloudy . Sunlight is
known to contain more circularly polarized light compared
to other artiﬁcial lighting [ 25]. As shown in Figure 10(a),
Stokes vectors are distributed more widely across s/prime
3axis
under sunlight compared with Indoor scene. In addition,we ﬁnd that DoCP is distributed at higher values for thesunlight compared to the indoor: pixels with DoCP over 0.5
are rarely observed in indoor scenes. This is also conﬁrmed
in the example s
3images for indoor and sunlight scenes.
Another interesting ﬁnding is that cloudy or sunny il-
lumination result in different polarization statistics. Fig-ure10(a) shows that Stokes vectors of cloudy scenes are
more concentrated near the origin, meaning that light ismore depolarized compared to light under clear sunlight.Indoor Sunlight Cloudy

This is aligned with previous studies [ 24,58] that report the

6. Conclusion
In this work, we have introduced a trichromatic and hy-perspectral Stokes image dataset that encompasses diversenatural scenes and various illumination conditions, total-
ing more than 2,333 scenes. We analyze the empiri-
cal distribution of the Stokes vectors of natural spectro-polarimetric images. To efﬁciently represent spatio-spectral-polarimetric data, we devise a PCA-based modeland an implicit neural representation. We further providedetailed analysis on Stokes gradient distributions, denois-ing characteristics, spectral dependency of SfP, and envi-ronment dependency. As such, our work provides a foun-dation for future research on spectral-polarimetric imagingand vision.
