Abstract
In the realm of point cloud scene understanding, partic-
ularly in indoor scenes, objects are arranged following hu-
man habits, resulting in objects of certain semantics being
closely positioned and displaying notable inter-object cor-
relations. This can create a tendency for neural networks
to exploit these strong dependencies, bypassing the individ-
ual object patterns. To address this challenge, we introduce
a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy. Our ap-
proach leverages both object patterns and contextual cues
to produce robust features. It begins with the formulation of
an object-exchanging strategy, where pairs of objects with
comparable sizes are exchanged across different scenes, ef-
fectively disentangling the strong contextual dependencies.
Subsequently, we introduce a context-aware feature learn-
ing strategy, which encodes object patterns without rely-
ing on their specific context by aggregating object features
across various scenes. Our extensive experiments demon-
strate the superiority of our method over existing SSL tech-
niques, further showing its better robustness to environmen-tal changes. Moreover, we showcase the applicability of
our approach by transferring pre-trained models to diverse
point cloud datasets.1
1. Introduction
Understanding the semantic content of 3D point cloud
data, particularly indoor scenes, is crucial in diverse fields,
including applications such as indoor robotics [3, 5, 29, 35].
Recent advancements in deep learning [8, 31] have show-
cased remarkable results in this domain. While effective,
these methods rely heavily on annotated training data and
fail when faced with distribution shifts in the test data [38].
Consequently, the extraction of resilient object features
from unlabeled data has become critical to advance the field.
Existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods [2, 19,
20, 25, 33] concentrate on feature aggregation by creating
positive pairs from the same object in different augmented

views of the scene. This maintains the relative relationships
between objects unchanged, thus failing to account for the
object dependencies. Notably, in indoor point cloud scenes,
object correlations are influenced by human habits, such as
the association of tables with chairs, or toilets with sinks,
resulting in strong inter-object entanglements. As demon-
strated in Figure 1(a), the pre-trained models like [32] strug-
gle to segment objects with unconventional correlations,
such as chairs on desks or dustbins located away from walls.
Although Mix3D [21] has been proposed to augment the
data by randomly combining two scenes, it does not reason
at the level of objects. Thus, the overlaps between objects
introduced by this method can disrupt the coherent patterns
formed by these objects. Without ground-truth labels, this
disruption leads to less meaningful features, limiting the
suitability of this approach in an SSL setting.
In this paper, our main focus is on developing an effec-
tive method for augmenting scene point clouds at the object
level to mitigate the impact of human-induced biases in the
context of self-supervised learning. Simultaneously, we aim
to extract features that are more robust to varied inter-object
correlations by better encoding both object patterns and
contextual information. To this end, we introduce (i) an Ob-
ject Exchange Strategy : This approach involves exchang-
ing the positions of objects of comparable size in different
scenes. By doing so, we effectively break the strong correla-
tions between objects while alleviating issues related to ob-
ject overlap. (ii) A Context-Aware Object Feature Learn-
ing Strategy : We first take the remaining objects, which
share similar context in two randomly augmented views, as
positive samples to encode the necessary contextual infor-
mation and object patterns. To counter strong inter-object
correlations, we minimize the feature distance between the
exchanged objects in distinct contextual settings. Note that
the contextual cues for a single object can vary significantly
across scenes. Therefore, minimizing the feature distance
between the exchanged objects enables the model to solely
focus on out-of-context object patterns. These two compo-
nents collectively provide a practical framework for learn-
ing robust features that encapsulate both object patterns and
contextual information.
Furthermore, the exchanged objects may violate conven-
tional human placement rules and appear incompatible with
their environmental context. To effectively recognize such
relocated objects, the model needs to comprehend both ob-
ject patterns and context information. We therefore intro-
duce an auxiliary task to enhance features related to both
object and context. This task involves predicting which
points belong to the objects that have been relocated. By
engaging in this task, the model gains a more comprehen-
sive understanding of both object patterns and contextual
information.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:• We introduce a novel point cloud Object Exchange Self-
Supervised Learning framework, named OESSL, for in-
door point clouds that learn object-level feature represen-
tations by encapsulating both object patterns and contex-
tual information.
• We propose a novel object-exchanging strategy that
breaks the strong correlations between objects without in-
curring object overlap.
• We introduce an auxiliary task aimed at regularizing each
object point feature to make it context-aware.
Our experiments on several datasets, including Scan-
Net [9], S3DIS [4], and Synthia4D [24], demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, especially in terms of robust-
ness to the contextual noise, as shown in Fig. 1 (b).
2. Related Work
Training with context data augmentation. For im-
age data, some researchers propose to add new instances
to scenes to generate diverse training samples [11, 12, 14,
30, 36]. Conversely, [6, 10, 23, 26, 39] suggest removing
contextual cues as data augmentation can also improve the
model performance. However, the techniques designed for
images cannot be directly applied to point clouds due to
their distinct data nature.
In the 3D domain, 4dcontrast [7] augments scenes with
moving synthetic objects and encourages feature similarity
between corresponding objects. However, 4dcontrast needs
synthetic datasets to obtain shapes, and moving a single
object introduces limited contextual diversity. Nekrasov et
al.[21] propose a data augmentation named Mix3D which
involves directly combining two point clouds and train-
ing models using augmented scenes in a supervised man-
ner. The merged scene becomes chaotic with occlusions
and overlaps, hindering the extraction of object-level fea-
tures in the self-supervised learning (SSL) setting. Addi-
tionally, this exchange lacks meaningful object interactions
and disrupts contextual information. By contrast, our object
exchange strategy integrates objects from different scenes,
greatly increasing the diversity of contextual cues while al-
leviating object overlap.
Self-supervised learning for 3D point clouds. Self-
supervised learning for point clouds has developed rapidly
in recent years [1, 2, 16, 19, 25]. In indoor scenes, recent
research [22, 32, 34] explores the nature of 3D point cloud
data by aggregating features within the same point/object.
For example, Pointcontrast [34] and MSC [32] aggregate
spatial features by maximizing the similarity between corre-
sponding point features; DepthContrast [37] and STRL [17]
aggregate features in each region and pull features from
different views together. Although effective, the correla-
tion between indoor objects is strongly influenced by hu-
man bias, resulting in strong entanglements between ob-
jects. Therefore, aggregating features from indoor objects

minimum circumscribed boxes for every cluster. Clusters with similar circumscribed boxes are matched as cluster pairs. We exchange

features. C.We minimize the cluster feature distance obtained from the exchanged clusters in the different scenes (i.e., ¯PmandˆPn,¯Pn

may lead to the model overfitting to inter-object correlations
and ignoring object patterns.
By contrast, our method disrupts the correlations be-
tween objects to mitigate the model’s dependence on con-
textual information. Additionally, we introduce a context-
aware object feature learning strategy that leverages both
object patterns and contextual information.
3. Method
The overall framework of our method is depicted in
Fig. 2 and contains two parts: Object exchange and context-
aware object feature learning. We discuss these components
in detail below.
3.1. Object exchange
Unsupervised clustering. Let us be given a se-
ries of point clouds P=
P1, P2, ..., PT	
de-
picting Tscenes, where Pk= ( Xk, Ck) =
(xk
1, ck
1),(xk
2, ck
2)...,(xk
Nk, ck
Nk)	
represents the k-th point
cloud with Nk3D points xk
i∈R3and corresponding RGB
colors ck
i∈R3. For each 3D point set Xk, we compute nor-
mals for each point following [9]. This process yields a set
ofNkpoint noramls Ok=
Ok
1, Ok
2, ..., Ok
Nk	
,Ok
i∈R3.
Then, these points are taken as vertices to construct a graph
whose weight matrix is defined as:
D= 2−(Dnor+α∗Dfeat), (1)where Dnorrepresents the matrix of pairwise cosine simi-
larity between the normals of two points, while Dfeatrepre-
sents the matrix of pairwise cosine similarity based on point
features. The parameter α∈[0,1]serves as a weight, bal-
ancing the influence of the two matrices. We initialize αat 0
and iteratively update it during the feature learning process
in Sec. 3.2.1. Note that when the positions of two points, i
andj, are not spatially adjacent, Dijis set to a large number.
Subsequently, we employ the GraphCut [13] algorithm, a
graph-based segmentation method, to cluster the points into
Mkclusters [9]. The center of each cluster is determined as
the average of all points belonging to that cluster.
Exchanging objects with comparable size. To ensure
meaningful object exchange without causing overlap with
nearby objects, we adopt a systematic approach. We first
apply [27] to all the clusters to generate Mkminimum cir-
cumscribed boxes, denoted as Bk={Bk
1, Bk
2, ..., Bk
Mk},
where Bk
irepresents the length, width, and height of the i-
th box in scene k. The pairwise box similarity is defined
as the Euclidean distance between the vectors composed of
length, width, and height, such that smaller distances corre-
spond to higher similarity. To enhance the diversity of ex-
changed objects, we employ a hybrid sampling strategy. For
theβMkclusters in scene k, where βis the preset exchange
proportion of the clusters, we first selectβ
2Mkclusters us-
ing the farthest point sampling (FPS) algorithm, ensuring a
23054
representative spatial distribution. The remaining clusters
are then chosen via random sampling, introducing an ele-
ment of randomness in the selection process.
Next, we introduce a similarity degree matrix, V∈
RβMk×Mh, where Vi,jindicates the pairwise box similar-
ity between cluster iin scene kand cluster jin scene h.
Following a greedy strategy, we match box pairs with the
highest similarity in V. Subsequently, the points belonging
to the corresponding matched clusters are exchanged be-
tween the two scenes. Leveraging Vhelps to avoid object
overlap, emphasizing the variability in contextual cues for
a single object across different scenes. Further insights into
the generation of robust features by exploiting such objects
are discussed in Sec. 3.2.2.
3.2. Context-aware Object Feature Learning
Having defined our object exchange strategy, we provide
more detail on how to extract the features and establish our
feature learning framework.
3.2.1 Feature extraction
Given an input point cloud Pnand a randomly selected
point cloud Pmfrom the dataset, we apply our object ex-
change strategy and data augmentation to create two novel
views ˆPmandˆPn, alongside two augmented views ¯Pmand
¯Pnwithout exchanging. To capture both point-wise and
cluster-wise information, we leverage MinkUnet [8] as our
backbone encoder, denoted as ϕ.
We initiate the feature extraction process by forward-
ingˆPmthrough the backbone encoder, obtaining point-
wise features ˆfm
i=ϕ(ˆPm)for each 3D point. Organiz-
ing these features according to clusters results in a set of
point-wise features, ˆFm={ˆFm
1,ˆFm
2, ...,ˆFm
Mm}, where
ˆFm
i∈RNm,i×d, with Nm,irepresenting the number of
points in cluster ifrom point cloud ˆPm, and dis the fea-
ture dimension of each ˆfm
i. Additionally, we employ max-
pooling on point features based on the clusters obtained
using GraphCut, generating cluster-wise features ˆCm=
{ˆcm
1,ˆcm
2,···,ˆcm
Mm}, where ˆcm
i∈R1×d. The features in
the other scenes can be obtained in the same way, as shown
in Fig. 2.
3.2.2 Feature aggregation
Aiming at a balanced concurrent ratio among objects of
different semantics, we operationalize our approach through
two central strategies for aligning cluster features: Object
Patterns Learning and Contextual Cues Learning, both de-
tailed below. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary task
dedicated to enhancing the encoder’s awareness of whether
an object’s feature distribution is in an unconventional loca-
tion. This design aims to mitigate the challenges associated
with cluster-level feature alignment by having regulariza-
tion on point-level distribution.Object patterns learning. To encourage the model to
learn object patterns, we minimize the feature distance be-
tween the clusters/points in the same cluster in different
scenes. Note that the contextual cues for a single object
can vary significantly between different scenes. Minimiz-
ing the feature distance between exchanged objects enables
the model to solely focus on object patterns.

the features of point jbelonging cluster iinˆPn. The loss
function Ln

same way. We then employ the symmetrized loss

Contextual cues learning. To learn contextual cues, we
minimize the feature distance between the remaining clus-
ters, which share similar contexts in two randomly aug-
mented views. To constrain the feature of each point, we
also minimize the distance between the point and the corre-
sponding cluster features [33].
LetMre

have not been exchanged in Pm. We write a loss

Auxiliary task. The auxiliary task aims to enable the
model to gain a more comprehensive understanding of both
object patterns and contextual information. For the point

2, ...,ˆym
ˆNmo
,
where ˆym
i∈[0,1]represents whether point ibelongs to

ˆNmo
, where ˆzm
i∈ {0,1}. For the
point cloud ˆPn, we obtain ˆYnandˆZnin a same way. We
then define a loss Lauxencoding the standard cross entropy
loss between ˆYmandˆZm, and ˆYnandˆZn.
Hence, our complete loss is written as
Ltotal=Lcontext +λLop+γLaux, (6)
where λandγare weights balancing the three loss terms.
We set λto 1 and γto 2 in our experiments.
4. Experiments
In this section, we first introduce our experimental set-
tings, including the datasets, object exchange details, and
implementation details. Then, we evaluate our pre-trained
models on downstream tasks and analyze our framework.
4.1. Experimental Settings
Datasets . ScanNet [9] consists of 3D reconstructions
of real rooms and comprises 1513 indoor scenes. We fol-
low the setting in [8] and use a training and validation
set, including 1201 and 312 scenes, respectively. The
training set is used for pre-training and fine-tuning. Our
framework utilizes scene-level point clouds for pre-training.
The Standford Large-Scale 3D Indoor Space (S3DIS) [4]
dataset contains 6 large-scale indoor areas [8]. We use
area5 as validation data and the remaining areas as train-
ing data. Synthia4D is a large dataset that contains 3D
scans of 6 sequences of driving scenes. Following [8], we
split the Synthia4D dataset into train/val/test sets including
19888/815/1886 scenes.
Object exchange details . To obtain better segmenta-
tions for object exchange and feature extraction, we update
the point features with our learned features to create the
affinity matrix. We set the initial relative weight αto 0 in
Eq. (1) and update the clusters twice during the training
process: first at one third and then at two thirds, by setting
αto 0.5. We set the similarity threshold in GraphCut [13]
to 1.5 and merge the clusters with fewer than 300 points.
In each scene, the clusters with any side length of the cor-
responding box exceeding 3 meters or less than 0.2 meters
are not used for exchange.
Implementation details . We use MinkUnet [8] as the
backbone feature extractor and build our framework on
the basis of BYOL [15]. DepthContrast [37], MSC [32],
STRL [17], and training from scratch are reproduced with
the same backbone as ours to have fair comparisons. We
pre-train the backbone on ScanNet for 200 epochs. The
learning rate is initially set to 0.036 with a cosine an-
nealing scheme with a minimum learning rate equal to
0.036×10−4. We use SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and aweight decay of 0.0004 following STSSL [33]. We use 8 ×
GTX3090 GPUs for pre-training and the batch size for each
GPU is 12, which leads to a total batch size of 96.
Evaluation metrics . We use the mean intersection over
union (mIoU) and the overall point classification accuracy
(Acc) to evaluate point cloud semantic segmentation, and
average precision (mAP, AP@50%, AP@25%) for instance
segmentation.
4.2. Scene Understanding
To evaluate the pre-training methods, we employ differ-
ent numbers of labels to fine-tune the models. In line with
previous methods [33, 37], we partition ScanNet, S3DIS,
and Synthia4D into distinct regimes, each corresponding
to different percentages of labeled data. Specifically, we
downsample the training data to levels of 10%, 20%, 50%,
and 100% for ScanNet and S3DIS, and 0.1%, 1%, 10%, and
100% for Synthia4D. To mitigate randomness, we down-
sample three different regimes for every percentage, fine-
tune the models separately using each regime, and report
the average performance. The number of training epochs
for every label regime can be found in the supplementary.
Indoor scene understanding . To evaluate the improve-
ment of our OESSL on indoor scene understanding, we fine-
tune the pre-trained model on ScanNet.

Table 1. Pre-training on ScanNet and evaluating the fine-tuned
models in different label regimes on ScanNet for semantic seg-
mentation. We report the mIoU.
In Table 1, we show the semantic segmentation results
obtained by fine-tuning with different percentages of train-
ing data. Our method achieves better mIou for all la-
bel regimes than MSC. Specifically, our method outper-
forms training from scratch by 5.38% at a level of 10%
and MSC [32] by 0.8% at a level of 20%. In Table 2, we
report the instance segmentation results driven by Point-
Group [18]. When using 10% of the labels for fine-tuning,
our method improves performance by 4.7% in AP@50%
compared to the network without pre-training. This evi-
dences that our pre-training framework is also beneficial for
discriminating instances.
Indoor scene transferability . The contextual informa-
tion significantly differs across datasets, making it difficult
to transfer contextual features between different datasets,
especially between indoor and outdoor scenes. By contrast,
the object patterns, such as color and shape, are commonly
shared between objects. Our method generates more trans-

ferable features by encoding object patterns without relying
on their specific context.
To demonstrate the transferability of the features learned
via our method, we pre-train models on ScanNet and fine-
tune them for semantic segmentation on S3DIS [4]. As
shown in Table 3, our pre-trained model performs better
than the other methods. Specifically, our method outper-
forms MSC [32] by 4.37% in mIoU with 10% of the labels.
These results strongly confirm the effectiveness of our ap-
proach at extracting object features that remain robust to
changes in the environment.
Outdoor scene transferability . We further fine-tune
the models pre-trained on ScanNet for semantic segmen-
tation using Synthia4D [24], a self-driving dataset with dif-
ferent contexts than indoor scenes. In Table 4 and Table 5,
we report the mIoU obtained by fine-tuning the models us-
ing Synthia4D. Our method outperforms the other meth-
ods consistently across all label regimes. Specifically, our
OESSL outperforms MSC [32] by 2.33% with 1% of the
labels in the test set. When utilizing only 0.1% of the train-
ing data, all pre-trained models exhibit a substantial im-
provement compared to training from scratch. Notably, our
method achieves the most significant improvement, result-
ing in an mIoU of 49.32% when evaluated on the validation
set. The improvements on S3DIS [4] and Synthia4D [24]
show that the features learned by our method generalize bet-
ter than those learned by other methods.

4.3. Ablation study
In this section, we dissect our OESSL and analyze each
component. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the model is
pre-trained and fine-tuned on ScanNet.
Breaking entanglements between objects. Due to in-
herent human biases, strong correlations exist among indoor
objects, indicating that certain classes of objects are highly
likely to co-occur. This co-occurrence introduces the risk of
the model overfitting to inter-object relations.
In Fig. 5, we illustrate the frequency of any two classes of
objects appearing together. In the original training dataset
(on the top of 5), certain classes exhibit a high frequency
of appearing together. For instance, the shower curtain
and door consistently appear simultaneously, and the co-
occurrence frequency between the counter and cabinet is
0.9. However, by exchanging objects between scenes, our
approach alleviates the high co-occurrence frequencies be-
tween objects, as shown in the bottom of Fig.5.
Performance under varied contexts. Our method
avoids overemphasizing contextual cues and is therefore
less affected by context changes compared to other SSL
techniques. To validate this, we evaluate the model’s per-
formance in scenes with varied contexts. Specifically, we
create a new dataset, ScanNet-C, by replacing a propor-
tionδof the objects in ScanNet with randomly selected
objects from the entire dataset. We report the ratio of the
model’s performance on ScanNet-C to its performance on
ScanNet. A higher ratio indicates a lower impact from con-
textual changes. In the experiment, we vary δand repeat
the experiment three times, reporting the average to reduce
randomness. As shown in Table 6, our pre-trained model
consistently achieves higher mIoU values for all δvalues,
confirming that our method is indeed more robust to con-
textual changes than other methods.
In Fig. 3, we visualize the semantic segmentation for
scenes generated by relocating objects in a reasonable but

unusual location. Specifically, a dustbin is placed far from
the walls and a sofa is placed on the desk. For such objects
with unreliable contextual cues, MSC [32] and the model
without pre-training fail to segment the point clouds. By
contrast, our OESSL accurately segments the objects, ben-
efiting from object patterns learning. For additional visual-
izations and detailed information about ScanNet-C, please
refer to the supplementary material.
Effect of the exchanged object proportion. In this
study, we aim to clarify the impact of the exchange ratio
on the learning process. The hyperparameter βrepresents
the proportion of exchanged clusters in the object exchange
strategy. In our approach, when the number of availableclusters in the scene exceeds 20, we set βto 0.5; otherwise,
we set it to 1. We keep βfixed during pretraining to evaluate
its impact on the model. The experiments are repeated three
times to mitigate randomness. As depicted in Fig. 4, the
performance initially increases and then decreases as βin-
creases. We hypothesize that this is because a higher βhas
the potential to increase the risk of object overlap, thereby
completely disrupting existing contextual information. As
shown in the bottom of Fig. 6, when βis set to 0.5, the
desk is replaced by a bed, breaking the correlation between
desk and sofa. However, a chair exchanges positions with
the pillow on the sofa, disrupting the object patterns when
βequals 0.7. The best-performing model corresponds to
setting βto 0.6, which balances the number of exchanged
objects and non-overlapping objects.

Comparison with Mix3D. Mix3D [21] is an augmen-
tation that directly combines two point clouds to generate
novel scenes and is effective for supervised semantic seg-
mentation training. Different from supervised training, self-
supervised pre-training aims to generate structured embed-
dings. Specifically, the objects of the same class should be
close in feature space and far from the objects from other
classes. The overlap between objects incurred by Mix3D
makes it difficult to distinguish the patterns between differ-
ent object classes, resulting in an irregular feature space.
Unlike Mix3D, our proposed object-exchanging strategy

mitigates object overlaps, as shown in the top of Fig. 6.
To further highlight the effectiveness of our proposed
object-exchanging strategy, we replace it with the Mix3D
method and minimize feature distance between correspond-
ing points/clusters in the newly generated scenes. This set-
ting, referred to as Baseline+Mix3D in Table 7, yields an
mIoU of 52.62%, lower than MSC and OESSL. It implies
that Mix3D is not suitable for self-supervised learning.
Loss functions. We ablate the three loss functions in
Eq. 6 to validate their effectiveness. Initially, we set β
to 0, ensuring that only the remaining clusters contribute,
and only the loss function of Eq.5 is applied. We refer to
this configuration as the baseline. Subsequently, by ad-
justing β, we activate the loss function in Eq.3, specifi-

cally designed for object pattern learning. This setting is
denoted as Baseline+ LOP. The results in Table 8 show
that Baseline+ LOPoutperforms the baseline, achieving an
mIoU of 53.90%. Our OESSL extends this by incorporat-
ing an auxiliary task, resulting in a remarkable mIoU of
54.37%, demonstrating superior performance.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, we have introduced a SSL framework for
point clouds, aiming to capture object features that are ro-
bust to noise and contextual variations. It starts by exchang-
ing objects with comparable sizes between different scenes,
breaking strong inter-object entanglements, and then learn-
ing both object patterns and contextual cues by leveraging
exchanged and remaining objects. Altogether, our approach
provides practical tools to learn robust context-aware repre-
sentation features for indoor scenes. Our experiments evi-
dence that our method outperforms the previous SSL meth-
ods for indoor point clouds.
