Abstract
We have recently seen tremendous progress in realistic
text-to-motion generation. Yet, the existing methods of-
ten fail or produce implausible motions with unseen text
inputs, which limits the applications. In this paper, we
present OMG, a novel framework, which enables com-
pelling motion generation from zero-shot open-vocabulary
text prompts. Our key idea is to carefully tailor the pretrain-
then-finetune paradigm into the text-to-motion generation.
At the pre-training stage, our model improves the gener-
ation ability by learning the rich out-of-domain inherent
motion traits. To this end, we scale up a large uncondi-
tional diffusion model up to 1B parameters, so as to utilize
the massive unlabeled motion data up to over 20M motion
instances. At the subsequent fine-tuning stage, we intro-
duce motion ControlNet, which incorporates text prompts
as conditioning information, through a trainable copy of
the pre-trained model and the proposed novel Mixture-
of-Controllers (MoC) block. MoC block adaptively rec-
ognizes various ranges of the sub-motions with a cross-
attention mechanism and processes them separately with
the text-token-specific experts. Such a design effectively
aligns the CLIP token embeddings of text prompts to var-
ious ranges of compact and expressive motion features. Ex-
tensive experiments demonstrate that our OMG achieves
significant improvements over the state-of-the-art meth-
ods on zero-shot text-to-motion generation. Project page:

1. Introduction
Generating vivid motions of human characters is a long-
standing task in computer vision, with numerous applica-
tions in movies, games, robotics, and VR/AR. The text-to-
motion setting aims to democratize motion generation for
novices and has recently received substantive attention.
Benefited from the existing text-annotated motion
datasets [19, 47], recent advances generate diverse motions
from text prompts, equipped with various generative mod-
els like V AEs [56, 76], autoregressive models [33, 87], and
diffusion models [12, 13,77,89]. However, these meth-

proach is capable of generating high-quality motions in response
to unseen text prompts.
ods heavily rely on the paired text-motion data with lim-
ited text annotations, and hence fall short of generalizing
to unseen open-vocabulary text inputs. Imagine generating
‚ÄúGollum breakdance footwork ‚Äù, it requires out-of-domain
generation ability with rich human knowledge to understand
the motion traits in various words like characters (Gollum,
ninja, etc.) or skills (breakdance, spinkick, etc.). To tackle
the open-vocabulary texts, recent works [8, 28,42] utilize
the zero-shot text-image alignment ability of the large-scale
pre-trained models, e.g., CLIP [57]. They adopt text-pose
alignments and hence remove the reliance on pair-wise text
and continuous motions. Yet, the discrete poses are insuf-
ficient to represent the rich motion traits, leading to unre-
alistic motion generation. On the other hand, recent ad-
vances [9, 21,63,88] enable impressive and controllable
text-driven image and even video generation, even from
open-vocabulary text inputs. Revisiting their huge success,
both the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm as well as scaling
up the model have played an important role. Yet, adopting

these strategies for text-to-motion generation is challenging.
First, there exists a huge imbalance between the quantities
of unpaired motion data and paired text-motion data. Sec-
ond, for open-vocabulary texts, various tokens correspond
to various motion traits, constituting a complex many-to-
many problem.
To tackle the challenges, we propose OMG ‚Äì a novel
scheme to generate motions of human characters from
open-vocabulary texts (see Fig. 1). Our key idea is to care-
fully tailor the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm into text-to-
motion generation. For pre-training, we adopt a minimalis-
tic design to scale up a large unconditional diffusion model,
so as to utilize the massive unlabeled motion data. For fine-
tuning, we first freeze the pre-trained large model. We then
adopt the trainable copy and treat the text prompts as ex-
tra conditions through a novel design, named mixture-of-
controllers, to learn to predict the conditional residuals. It
adaptively fuses the motion traits corresponding to various
tokens from the input text prompts, so as to handle the am-
biguity between the text and motion modalities.
Specifically, at the pre-training stage, we adopt the
diffusion transformer [52] as the backbone with over-
parameterized motion representation. We then scale up the
models with parameters ranging from 88M to 1B, leverag-
ing over 20M unlabeled motion instances from a diverse
range of 13 publicly available datasets. During training, we
also adopt a sliding random window strategy to crop various
motion sequences, to improve the generation ability for ar-
bitrary lengths of motion. To this end, the pre-trained model
learns the rich inherent motion features with a large motion
manifold to ensure the realism of the generated motions.
For the subsequent stage, to incorporate the text prompts
as conditioning information, we adopt a fine-tuning scheme
called motion ControlNet, analogous to the famous Con-
trolNet [88] for the text-image generation task. It includes
a trainable copy of the large-scale pre-trained model, which
serves as a strong backbone to retain the motion features, as
well as a novel block called Mixture-of-Controllers (MoC).
Such MoC block can effectively inject residual information
into the pre-trained model, based on the motion features and
the CLIP-based text embeddings. Our key design in the
MoC block is the cross-attention mechanism between text
and motion, as well as the text-token-specific Mixture-of-
Experts [16, 67], which are to be detailed in later sections.
Such a design effectively aligns the token embeddings of
text prompts to various ranges of compact and expressive
motion features, which are warmed up from a powerful pre-
trained model. As a result, our OMG approach achieves
compelling generation from open-vocabulary texts, signif-
icantly outperforming prior arts. In particular, only fine-
tuned on the HumanML3D dataset [19], it can generate
vivid motions of various human characters with diverse mo-
tion skills from the Mixamo dataset [1], as shown Fig. 1.To summarize, our main contributions include:
‚Ä¢ We propose a text-to-motion generation approach with a
pretrain-then-finetune paradigm to scale up both data and
model, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.
‚Ä¢ We experimentally demonstrate that pre-training on large-
scale unlabeled motion data improves the generation re-
sults from diverse and open-vocabulary texts.
‚Ä¢ We propose a fine-tuning scheme for text conditioning,
utilizing a mixture of controllers to effectively improve
the alignment between text and motion.

Conditional Motion Synthesis. Being able to generate re-
alistic and contextually relevant motion sequences based
on various types of conditions, conditional motion synthe-
sis has received increasing attention in the field of mo-
tion generation. Common types of conditions include
text [3, 4,12,20,34,41,43,56,66,76,84], action [18, 55],
music [2, 35,37,39], speech [5, 6,22,92], control sig-
nals [54, 71,73,81], action labels [18, 55,82], incom-
plete motion sequences [14, 23], images [11, 25,40,60,61]
and scene [91]. The advent of Diffusion Models [26, 70]
has given a big boost to text-driven motion synthesis. Kim
et al. [34] develops a transformer-based diffusion model
which could generate and edit motions well aligned with
the given text. Motion Diffusion Model (MDM) [77] com-
bines insights already well established in the motion gener-
ation domain and in each diffusion step predicts the sample
rather than the noise. Motion Latent-based Diffusion model
(MLD) [12] performs a diffusion process on the motion la-
tent space. Besides the diffusion model, T2M-GPT [87]
investigates a framework that combines VQ-V AE [79] and
autoregressive model. However, since these models are
trained only based on paired text-motion datasets such as
HumanML3D [20], they cannot well handle unseen text
prompts.
Open-vocabulary Generation. Instead of relying on pre-
existing data, zero-shot text-driven generation leverages
general knowledge learned during training to create novel
content from text prompts. Reed et al. [59] uses DC-GAN
architecture to steer for zero-shot text-to-image synthesis.
CLIP [57], pre-trained on four hundred million image-text
pairs, possesses the remarkable ability to effectively com-
prehend and generate meaningful associations between im-
ages and text. With CLIP‚Äôs strong ability, many works
are able to generate high-quality zero-shot text-driven im-
ages [17, 51,83] or 3D objects [31, 32,49,53,65,80]. In
the motion synthesis field, some works have attempted to
investigate open-vocabulary text-to-motion generation and
achieved good results. MotionCLIP [76] utilizes a decoder
to decode the CLIP motion embeddings. AvatarCLIP [28]
synthesizes a key pose and then retrieves the closest mo-
tion from the database. Lin et al. [42] pre-train a motion

generator that learns to reconstruct the full motion from the
masked motion with the key pose. Make-An-Animation [8]
pre-trains generative model with diverse in-the-wild text-
pose pair. However, since these approaches are based on
text-pose alignment, the generated motion is deficient in re-
alism due to a lack of global rotation and translation. Re-
cently, MotionGPT [33] pre-trains and fine-tunes the large
language model with tokenized motion and text data. How-
ever, it still struggles to generate novel motion from open-
vocabulary text prompts.
Mixture-of-Experts. In the deep learning field, Mixture-
of-Experts (MoE) [16, 30,67] in a neural network architec-
ture divides specific model parameters into distinct groups,
referred to as ‚Äúexperts‚Äù. Eigen et al. [15] use a different gat-
ing network at each layer in a multi-layer network, increas-
ing the number of effective experts by introducing an expo-
nential number of paths through different combinations of
experts at each layer. Other research that regards the entire
model as an expert [38] also achieves good results. More-
over, endeavors are underway to enhance the training and
inference speed within the MoE framework [24, 36]. The
MoE paradigm is applicable not only to language process-
ing tasks but also extends to visual models [62], Mixture-
of-Modality-Experts in multi-modal transformers [68], as
well as motion synthesis. Holden et al. [27] develop phase-
functioned experts blended by pre-defined blending weights
to control character at a specific phase, and Starke et al.
[72, 73], Zhang et al. [85] uses a gating network to pre-
dict the blending weights, achieving impressive results of
character control. Inspired by them, we devise text-token-
specific experts to control the corresponding sub-motions.3. Methods
We aim to generate realistic and diverse human motions that
are conditioned on text prompts, which capture complex
and abstract motion characteristics with zero-shot open-
vocabulary descriptions. To this end, we adopt pretrain-
then-finetune paradigm to enhance the capability of our
model. For the unconditional denoiser (Fig. 2left), we
leverage a large-scale unlabeled motion dataset for motion
diffusion pre-training and scale the model size up (Sec. 3.1).
For the conditional denoiser (Fig. 2middle), we devise
a specific conditional fine-tuning scheme called motion
ControlNet, including a novel conditioning design called
Mixture-of-Controllers, to exploit the zero-shot capability
of the CLIP text embeddings (Sec. 3.2). During inference
(Fig. 2right), we further use classifier-free guidance to com-
bine the unconditional denoiser and the conditional one.
3.1. Motion Diffusion Pre-training
Large-scale Unlabeled Motion Dataset. To facilitate
large-scale pre-training in the motion domain, we collected
a large amount of high-quality human motion data total-
ing over 20M frames from various sources, such as char-
acter animation datasets, marker-based, IMU-based, and
multi-view markerless mocap datasets. We then standard-
ize the frame rate and re-target them to the unified paramet-
ric skeleton of SMPL body model [45] using off-the-shelf
re-targeting algorithms [86]. After that, following the pre-
vious successful works [19, 77] on motion generation, we
enrich the SMPL skeletons with an over-parameterized mo-
tion representation that facilitates network learning.

Model Scaling Up. We design our pre-trained diffusion
model with minimalism, only preserving the essential mod-
ules that are scalable and efficient to adapt to expanding
data. To this end, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) [52] architecture as our network backbone, due to
its scalability and impressive performance with increasing
input tokens and training data. The only difference is that
we use rotary positional embedding [74] to encourage the
model to capture the relative temporal relations among the
frames. To study the dependence of performance on model
size, we train 4 different sizes of our OMG model, rang-
ing from 88 million parameters to 1 billion parameters.
Tab. 1 shows the configuration details of our 4 models. Here
nlayers is the total number of layers, dmodel is the number
of units in each bottleneck layer (we always have the feed-
forward layer two times the size of the bottleneck layer, dff
= 2dmodel ), and dhead is the dimension of each attention
head, and nparams is the total number of trainable parame-
ters.
Training. We train our unconditional denoiser Duto pre-
dict the clean motion ÀÜ x(0)given diffusion timestep twith
the simple objective:
Lsimple =Ex,t,œµ[Œªt||x‚àí Du(x(t), t)||2
2], (1)
where x(t)=x+œÉtœµist-step noised motion, noise œµ‚àº
N(0,I),Œªtis the loss weighting factor. Furthermore, we
introduce geometric losses, analogous to MDM [77], that
contain velocity loss Lvel, and foot contact loss Lfoot to
enforce physical properties and anti-sliding. Overall, the
unconditional denoiser Duis thus trained with the following
objective:
L=Lsimple +ŒªvelLvel+ŒªfootLfoot. (2)
In our experiments, Œªvel= 30 andŒªfoot= 30 . The
number of diffusion timesteps Tis set to 1,000 with co-
sine noise level schedule [50]. We train all sizes of the
model for 1M iterations with a batch size of 256using the
AdamW [46] optimizer with a weight decay of 0, a maxi-
mum learning rate of 10‚àí4, and a cosine LR schedule with
10K linear warmup steps. The models are trained using
Pytorch with ZeRO [58] memory redundancy strategy on
8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The largest model OMG-G takes
1500 GPU hours for pre-training.

The MoC block first fuses the text features and motion features
and simultaneously determines the sub-motion ranges for each text
token with the cross-attention mechanism. Then it performs fine-
grained control of sub-motions with text-token-specific experts.
Sliding Random Windows. During training, we propose
sliding random windows that iterate over each motion state
frame xiin the motion dataset to sample motion sequences
starting from xi. Specifically, for the ithframe, we ran-
domly crop a sub-sequence xof length lwith a random
window [i, i+l), where l‚àº U[1, L]is a uniform variable,
andLis the hyper-parameter that determines the maximum
length of the generated motion sequence of our model. This
pushes the model to learn the relations among both temporal
frames and spatial features of a single motion state to pro-
cess arbitrary lengths of motions even a single keyframe, to
facilitate the following fine-grained control of sub-motions
of arbitrary lengths. In our experiments, for balancing res-
olution and duration, the maximum length Lof sliding ran-
dom windows is set to 300with the framerate set to 30.

3.2. Motion ControlNet
To incorporate the text prompts c={ci}n
i=1into the pre-
trained motion model, We adopt a fine-tuning scheme we
call motion ControlNet to condition on text prompts, in-
spired by image ControlNet [88], including a trainable copy
of original transformer layers and the proposed condition-
ing blocks called Mixture-of-Controllers (MoC).
As illustrated in Fig. 3 top, we freeze the parameters of
the pre-trained transformer layer and combine a trainable
copy of the layer with a MoC block that injects nresiduals
corresponding to ntext tokens into the output of the original
transformer layer. Specifically, the frozen parameters retain
the pre-trained denoising ability, while the trainable copy
reuses the large-scale pre-trained model as a strong initial
backbone to learn to extract semantic motion features from
intermediate representation hlof the last layer. And based
on that, the MoC block is employed to predict the ncon-
ditional residuals rcorresponding to ntext tokens, all of
which are then added to the original output hl+1. To do so,
a pre-trained CLIP text encoder E(c)is employed to extract
the text token embeddings.
Mixture-of-Controllers. In the Mixture-of-Controllers
block (Fig. 3 bottom), our key idea is to control the sub-
motion sequences separately with different expert con-
trollers in an MoE fashion [16, 67], so as to better align
them to the corresponding text token embeddings in CLIP
space. For instance, for the given text prompt ‚ÄúGollum
jumps forward‚Äù , the ‚ÄúGollum‚Äù token corresponds to the
entire sequence while ‚Äújumps‚Äù corresponds only to the sub-
sequence when he is jumping.
To this end, we introduce two cooperative designs. The
first one is a cross-attention mechanism to fuse the text
features and motion features and simultaneously determine
the sub-motion ranges for each text token. The second one
is the text-token-specific experts selected from an expert
pool to perform fine-grained control of sub-motions.
For the cross-attention mechanism , a sequence of mo-tion features f‚ààRl√ódmis input into a cross-attention layer
along with text embeddings E(c)‚ààRn√ódc, where lde-
notes the length of the sequence, dmrepresents the dimen-
sion of the motion features, ndenotes the number of the
text tokens, and dcrepresents the dimension of text embed-
ding. The cross-attention layer projects fto a query ma-
trixQ=f¬∑WQ
m, where WQ
m‚ààRdm√ódmis the motion
projection matrix. And E(c)is projected to a key matrix
K=E(c)WK
cand a value matrix V=E(c)WV
c, where
WK
c, WV
c‚ààRdc√ódmare the text projection matrices. Then
the text values Vare distributed into the motion sequence
with the attention mechanism:
f‚Ä≤=f+softmax (QKT
‚àö
d)V. (3)
Simultaneously an attention map between text tokens
and motion sequence is produced, denoted by A=
softmax (QKT
‚àö
d)‚ààRl√ón. Within this attention map, the
ithcolumn A‚àó,iindicates a correspondence between a sub-
motion sequence and the ithtext token. Besides, we em-
ploy the adaptive instance normalization (Ada-IN) condi-
tioning on ‚ü®eos‚ü©(end of sequence) token to normalize f‚Ä≤
before sending them to the experts. Since CLIP ‚ü®eos‚ü©token
summarizes the entire text, we intuitively use it to unify the
distribution of the entire motion sequence.
For the text-token-specific experts , we define an expert
controller corresponding to ithtext token E(ci)as a two-
layer feed-forward network (denoted by F) with parame-
terse(i)={W0‚ààRdm√ó2dm,W1‚ààR2dm√ódm,b0‚àà
R2dm,b1‚ààRdm}. Furthermore, the parameters e(i)are
generated by blending Kexpert parameters {e1, ...,eK}in
an expert pool, each of which is in a form of the same pa-
rameter configuration:

tively.
Additionally, a down-projection and up-projection 1-D
convolution pair is used to process input and output respec-
tively to reduce the control latent dimension and thus the
trainable parameters. Moreover, similar to image Control-
Net [88], we use zero-initialized convolution parameters to
protect the trainable copy from the harmful gradient noises
in the initial training steps.Training and Inference. The conditional denoiser Dcis
also trained using the same objective L(Eq. (2)) with train-
able parameters in motion ControlNet. In our experiments,
we employ the frozen CLIP-VIT-L/14 [57] text encoder to
extract text embeddings at the final layer normalization with
dimension dc= 768 and we truncate the text tokens with
the maximum token number 77. We set the down-projection
latent dimension dmof MoC blocks to 256, the expert pool
sizeK= 12 , and attention mask sharpness Œ≥= 24 and
threshold Œ≤= 0.25. We train all the motion ControlNets
for500epochs with a batch size of 64using the AdamW
optimizer with a weight decay of 1√ó10‚àí5, a maximum
learning rate of 3√ó10‚àí5, and a cosine LR schedule with
1K linear warmup steps. In the training process, we ran-
domly replace ‚ü®eos‚ü©token with the empty token with 50%
probability to increase the ability to capture global seman-
tics in text tokens as a replacement.
During inference, classifier-free guidance is used to com-
bine unconditional denoiser and conditional denoiser:
ÀÜx(0)= (1‚àís)¬∑ Du(x(t), t) +s¬∑ Dc(x(t), t,c). (7)
In our experiments, DDIM [69] sampling strategy with 200
timesteps is employed and the guidance strength s= 4.5.

Table 2. Comparison of text-to-motion generation on Hu-
manML3D [20] and Mixamo [1] test set. We ran all the evalua-
tions 20 times, with the average reported alongside a 95% confi-
dence interval. The right arrow ‚Üímeans the closer to real motion
the better. Bold and underline indicate the best and the second
best result. The term (Zero-shot) implies that the dataset contains
unseen open-vocabulary texts.
4. Experiments
We show qualitative results in Fig. 4. Our method enables
fine-grained control of complex and abstract motion trait
descriptions. We encourage the reader to appreciate more
qualitative results provided in supplements and the video.
4.1. Datasets and Evaluation Metrics
Training Datasets. At the pre-training stage, we utilize
various publicly available human motion datasets, such
as artist-created datasets [23, 48], marker-based [7, 29,
44,47,75], IMU-based [40, 78] and multi-view marker-
less [10, 39,41,90] motion capture datasets, totaling over
20 million frames. In the subsequent conditional fine-tuning
stage, we train our motion ControlNet using the text-motion
HumanML3D [20] dataset, for fair comparisons with previ-
ous methods.
Evaluation Datasets. We test on two benchmarks, the
HumanML3D [20] and the Mixamo [1] test set. The Hu-
manML3D test set evaluates the in-domain performance.
And the Mixamo dataset consists of abundant artist-created
animations and human-annotated descriptions, offering a
wide variety of diverse and dynamic motions, utilized to
compare the zero-shot performance across the domains.
Evaluation Metrics are summarized as four parts. (1)
Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is our principal metric to
evaluate the feature distributions between the generated and
real motions. (2) Motion-retrieval precision (R-Precision)
calculates the text and motion Top 3 matching accuracy un-
der feature space. (3) CLIP-score. Borrowing from text-to-
image synthesis [64], we use CLIP-score to evaluate zero-
shot text-motion consistency by measuring cosine similar-
ity in CLIP space. To do so, we train a motion encoder
using the training set of HumanML3D and Mixamo to ex-
tract motion features that are aligned to text embeddings in
CLIP space as same as [76]. (4) Diversity is assessed by
calculating variance through features.
Figure 6. Quantitative evaluation on pre-training, model size, and
expert pool size. (a) Models wpre-training show consistently
improved performance over w/opre-training, and wpre-training
models, which benefit from large-scale motion data, improve with
increasing model size. (b) Larger expert pool sizes improve the
performance.
4.2. Comparison
We compare our approach with various state-of-the-art
methods. Specifically, we apply conditional motion diffu-
sion models, including MDM [77], MLD [12], MotionDif-
fuse [89], V AE-based model MotionCLIP [76], and auto-
regressive model T2M-GPT [87]. Besides, we also apply
MAA [8] based on the text-pose alignment method, and
MotionGPT [33] utilizing motion-language pre-training.
Some results on HumanML3D are borrowed from their own
paper. The quantitative results are presented in Tab. 2.
Our method demonstrates the best text-to-motion align-
ment (R-Precision) in the in-domain evaluation. Moreover,
among all diffusion-based methods, our model achieves the
best FID. In terms of zero-shot performance, our approach
achieves the best FID and CLIP-score, outperforming pre-
vious methods. This suggests a superior capability for high-
quality motion generation and effective matching with zero-
shot text prompts. As depicted in Fig. 5of the qualitative
results, our model demonstrates the capability to generate
motions that show more realism, and better alignment with
each motion characteristic description, whether in the sen-
tence or phrase.
4.3. Ablation Study
To examine the specific contributions of our novel OMG
model architecture, we conduct a series of ablation stud-
ies focusing on the roles of pre-training, model scale, and
multiple expert controllers. Additionally, we undertake an
in-depth analysis of our MoC Block. These evaluations uti-
lize the out-of-domain dataset Mixamo [1], providing a ro-
bust testbed to ascertain the effectiveness of the technical
designs on the zero-shot performance of our model.
Effect of Pre-training and Model Scale. Our investigation
into the impact of pre-training involves training several vari-

ant models without pre-training (w/o pre-training) across
four distinct scales (see Tab. 1). These models are then
compared against counterparts with the pre-training process
(wpre-training). As illustrated in Fig. 6a,wpre-training
consistently outperforms w/opre-training, achieving lower
FID across all sizes. This indicates that our model‚Äôs per-
formance on zero-shot motion generation is effectively en-
hanced through pre-training. Meanwhile, we observe that
the performance of wpre-training improves with increas-
ing model size. Qualitative analysis, as shown in Fig. 7a, re-
veals that the ‚ÄúGollum‚Äù characteristic of the generated mo-
tions becomes more pronounced with larger models. This
suggests that larger model sizes enhance the overall quality
and alignment of the generated motions.
Effect of Expert Pool Size. To systematically analyze the
impact of multiple experts, we train four distinct variants
of the OMG model, sweeping over different expert pool
sizes (K = 1,4,8, and 12respectively). The results, as de-
picted in Fig. 6b, demonstrate a discernible decrease in FID
as expert pool size increases. This trend suggests that the
larger expert hypothesis space enhances the experts‚Äô ability
to align sub-motions with their respective text embeddings.
Evaluation of the MoC Block. In order to assess the ef-
fectiveness of our proposed MoC block, we explore its per-
formance through several variant configurations: (1)Cross-
attn + FFN, where the architecture is pruned to include
only a cross-attention layer and a feed-forward network; (2)
w/o Zero Conv, substituting zero convolutions with stan-
dard convolutional layers initialized using Gaussian distri-
butions; and (3)w/o Attention Mask, omitting the mul-
tiplication of attention masks with the output of the ex-
pert layer. These variant models are rigorously compared
against our original OMG model. Quantitative results, as
shown in Tab. 3, demonstrate that the exclusion of specific
components within the MoC Block leads to a worse result in
both the FID and CLIP-score. This observation underscores
the integral contributions of these components to the mo-
tion generation process. Qualitative analysis, presented in
Fig.7b, indicates noticeable deficiencies in the motion gen-
eration of all three variants: variant (1)is not able to clearly
depict ‚Äúspin‚Äù motions; variant (2)exhibits less expressive

a superior ability to more accurately align motion with the
text prompt.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we present a novel text-to-motion generation
framework, OMG, that combines the advantages of condi-
tional generative models and text-pose alignment methods.
It carefully tailors pretrain-then-finetune paradigm into text-
to-motion generation. The pre-training stage leverages a
large amount of unlabeled motion data to train a powerful
unconditional diffusion model that ensures the realism and
diversity of the generated motions. The fine-tuning stage
introduces motion ControlNet including the proposed novel
text conditioning block called Mixture-of-Controllers. With
the cross-attention mechanism and text-token-specific ex-
perts, it adaptively aligns the sub-motion features to the text
embeddings in the CLIP space in an MoE fashion. The ex-
tensive experiments demonstrate that OMG achieves state-
of-the-art zero-shot performance on text-to-motion gener-
ation. We believe it is a significant step towards open-
vocabulary motion generation of human characters, with
wide potential applications in movies, games, robotics, and
VR/AR.
