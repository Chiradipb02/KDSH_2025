Abstract
3D correspondence, i.e., a pair of 3D points, is a fun-
damental concept in computer vision. A set of 3D corre-spondences, when equipped with compatibility edges, formsa correspondence graph. This graph is a critical com-ponent in several state-of-the-art 3D point cloud registra-
tion approaches, e.g., the one based on maximal cliques(MAC). However , its properties have not been well under-
stood. So we present the ﬁrst study that introduces graphsignal processing into the domain of correspondence graph.We exploit the generalized degree signal on correspondence
graph and pursue sampling strategies that preserve high-frequency components of this signal. To address time-
consuming singular value decomposition in deterministicsampling, we resort to a stochastic approximate samplingstrategy. As such, the core of our method is the stochasticspectral sampling of correspondence graph. As an applica-
tion, we build a complete 3D registration algorithm termed
as FastMAC, that reaches real-time speed while leading tolittle to none performance drop. Through extensive exper-iments, we validate that FastMAC works for both indoorand outdoor benchmarks. F or example, FastMAC can ac-celerate MAC by 80 times while maintaining high registra-

1. Introduction
Correspondence is one of the most fundamental computer
vision concepts, since it encodes important geometric rela-tionships such as multi-view transformation (2D-2D [ 37]o r
3D-3D [ 59][75][74] correspondence) or single-view projec-
tion (2D-3D correspondence [ 56][64]). 3D correspondence,
which is by deﬁnition a pair of matched 3D points, plays animportant role in 3D registration [ 72] and downstream ap-
plications like SLAM [ 8], 3D reconstruction [ 20][35] and
3D scene understanding [ 12][25][24][60]. While the com-
munity has studied 3D correspondence for a long time, 3Dcorrespondence graph is not yet well-understood.
In this graph, each vertex is a 3D correspondence, and
the edge connectivity is usually deﬁned according to thecompatibility between two correspondences. For example,if a certain compatibility metric is higher than a threshold,an edge is active between two correspondences. This graphis indeed a critical component in state-of-the-art 3D reg-istration methods like MAC [ 71]. MAC, as our baseline,
searches for maximal cliques on this graph and estimatesrelative poses using compatible correspondences.
This CVPR paper is the Open Access version, provided by the Computer Vision Foundation.
Except for this watermark, it is identical to the accepted version;
the final published version of the proceedings is available on IEEE Xplore.

However, MAC can be quite slow with numerous input
correspondences, with a single registration can cost morethan one second, as shown in Figure. 1. This makes it far
from deployment for real-time applications such as SLAM.A natural idea is to downsample this graph for efﬁciency.We introduce the framework of graph signal processing [ 10]
to achieve this goal. Speciﬁcally, we use the generalizeddegree, i.e., the weighted edge sum, of each node in the
graph as the graph signal and preserves its high frequencycomponent with a graph ﬁlter, which is the Laplacian matrixin our work. We derive an optimal sampling strategy that
best preserves the ﬁltered high-frequency signal of interest.
High-frequency. The principle is that we need to sam-
ple nodes with fast change of generalized degree over thecorrespondence graph (short as high-frequency nodes for
brevity), since they are better suited for maximal cliquesearch. The intuition is three-fold: (1) Every maximal
clique must contain one high-frequency node; (2) Maximalcliques tend to contain three or more high-frequency nodes;(3) Cut-points, which are always high-frequency nodes, arecontained in more than one maximal clique.
Stochastic Sampling. There exist well-established de-
terministic sampling methods to recover a certain signal ofinterest on a graph [ 10]. But they involve iterative singular
value decomposition operations which are time-consuming
thus contradict the goal of accelerating MAC. As such,
we derive a stochastic approximated sampling strategy thattakes constant time w.r.t. sample number.
To summarize, we make these contributions: (1) For the
ﬁrst time, we introduce graph signal processing to 3D cor-respondence graph. (2) We propose a stochastic samplingstrategy that selects high-frequency nodes on a correspon-dence graph. (3) We develop a full registration pipelineFastMAC upon the proposed sampling method, which issuited for maximal clique search. (4) FastMAC achievestrivial performance drop on indoor and outdoor datasets,while achieving 80 times acceleration to a real-time level.
2. Related Works
3D point cloud registration is important to many real-worldproblems, including pose estimation [ 42], SLAM [ 47], and
3D reconstruction [ 21]. However, globally optimal 3D
point cloud registration is very challenging and existingworks can be summarized into six primary categories:
Maximum Consensus (MC) is a widely used robust op-
timization objective in point cloud registration [ 41]. Com-
pared with other robust optimization objectives such asTruncated-Least-Squares (TLS), MC has its advantage of
being superior under certain circumstances[ 15]. However,
MC may produce an error-prone estimate depending on theinput conditions [ 9]. Moreover, directly solving Maximum
Consensus entails an NP-hard computational complexity,which has been conﬁrmed by prior research [ 16].Stochastic Techniques. To address the complex-
ity of solving the NP-hard Maximum Consensus prob-lem, stochastic techniques have been proposed and Ran-dom Sample Consensus (RANSAC) is a well-known one
among them. Numerous extensions and enhancements to
RANSAC have been devised, aiming to improve its efﬁ-ciency [ 61][19], accuracy [ 62], and robustness [ 32][58].
However, it is still essential to recognize that the conver-gence speed of RANSAC exhibits an exponential relation-ship with the rate of outliers in the dataset [ 7].
Branch-and-Bound. The Branch-and-Bound (BnB)
[4][43][73] algorithm stands as a fundamental technique in
optimization and search problems, for registration. It canexplore and assess all solution possibilities systematicallyand intelligently remove less promising ones, ensuring anoptimal solution. Still, it is important to note that BnB ex-
hibits an exponential complexity concerning the problem
size and the presence of outliers within the dataset [ 7].
Mixed Integer Program. BnB has been extended with
Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) [ 34] to speed up com-
putation. But MIP itself also demonstrates that the incorpo-ration of Linear-Matrix-Inequality Constraints signiﬁcantlyexpedites computational processes [ 57]. Several avenues
of exploration has been done including TEASER++ [ 66],
Fast-Global-Registration (FGR) [ 76] and other works [ 65].
Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the computational timestill exhibits sensitivity to both the outlier rate and problemsize, underscoring the need for further improvements.
Simultaneous Pose and Correspondence (SPC) meth-
ods represent another prominent paradigm within the ﬁeldof point cloud registration, with the pioneering work of theIterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm as a cornerstone [ 5].
Over time, several robust extensions of the ICP method
have been introduced [ 27][31][14][39][54]. SPC methods
are often lauded for their swiftness and precision, yet theydo exhibit a notable vulnerability to local minima, a limita-tion that has been acknowledged [ 47]. Though global SPC
methods like Go-ICP [ 67] have been proposed, it is impor-
tant to note that many global methods in the SPC paradigm
still rely on Branch-and-Bound (BnB) techniques [ 28][6
].
Consistency Graph-based Methods. Recently, several
approaches based on consistency graph are proposed forpoint cloud registration, emphasizing the encoding of con-sistency among pairs of correspondences through the uti-
lization of invariants [ 22][40][33][68] structured within a
graph framework. Researchers have sought to enhance theefﬁciency of the search for these maximum cliques throughthe introduction of more efﬁcient search algorithms [ 46]
and various relaxations to the maximum clique problem[38][55]. Previous research [ 50] has explored sampling of
correspondences, but we address the problem from the per-
spective of graph signal processing for the ﬁrst time.

Figure 2. Pipeline of FastMAC. In the top-right panel, we show the the procedure of constructing a correspondence graph from input
correspondences. The graph is mathematically represented by an adjacency matrix. High values in this matrix mean high compatibilitybetween two correspondences. In the bottom panel, we deﬁne generalized degree signal on the graph as the aggregation of compatibility
scores on edges connecting with a node. We pass the signal through a Laplacian high-pass graph ﬁlter (constructed from the adjacencymatrix) to get its high-frequency component. As mentioned in the text, after ﬁltering, nodes with high response are named as high-frequency
nodes . In the top-left panel, we derive a stochastic sampling strategy in which the sampling probability of a node is proportional to the
response magnitude. This sampling strategy is a fast approximation of the optimal (but slow) deterministic sampling strategy that recoversa signal of interest. Lastly but not shown in this ﬁgure, we use the MAC registration algorithm on output correspondences.
3. Methods
Our goal is fast and accurate 3D point cloud registration and
our method is based upon the recently published maximalclique (MAC) method [ 71]. It has four steps as shown in the
time proﬁling of Fig. 1and Table. 1. (1) Graph Construc-
tion, which builds a correspondence graph on the input cor-
respondences. We inherit this step as shown in the top-right
panel of Fig. 2. (2) Maximal Clique Search , which ﬁnds
all maximal cliques in the graph as the name implies. (3)Node-guided Clique Selection , which reduces the number
of maxmimal clique candidates and ﬁnally (4) Pose Esti-
mation , which evaluates pose hypothesis generated in each
clique and chooses the best one as the output pose.
The key intuition behind MAC is to loosen the previ-
ous maximum clique constraint [ 36], and use more maxi-
mal clique candidates to generate potentially accurate posehypotheses. However it is very slow when there are manyinput correspondences and Maximal Clique Search is
the biggest bottleneck due to its exponential complexity.Hence, we aim to design a sampling module that reducesgraph size without sacriﬁcing the maximal clique registra-
tion performance. Our sampling module is shown in the
bottom and top-left panels of Fig. 2. It is inserted into
the ﬁrst and second step of MAC, which means the outputcorrespondences are input into the remaining three steps ofMAC. That is the difference between MAC and FastMAC.
How to achieve this graph down sampling? There are
widely used modules like random sampling and farthestpoint sampling [ 48]. But as shown later in Fig. 4,F i g . 5and
Fig.6, they perform poor for MAC acceleration. So we re-
sort to the graph signal processing theory [ 52][53][10][11].
Due to page limit, its basics are presented in Appendix A.1.
First, as shown in the top-right panel of Fig. 2, we con-
struct a correspondence graph G
corrand the adjacency ma-
trixWSOG, in which SOG means second order graph, fol-
lowing MAC [ 71]. Due to page limit, the details are pre-
sented in Appendix A.4. It is noteworthy that the value inW
SOG means compatibility between two correspondences.
Generalized Degree Signal. In order to exploit the
graph signal processing theory, we need to deﬁne a signalon the correspondence graph. The normal degree signal for

a node is the number of edges it connects. In a weighted
graph, the generalized degree signal for a node is deﬁned asthe sum of edge weight it connects. In the following sec-
tions, we will explain why this signal can help us constructa graph ﬁlter that is suited for maximal clique search.
3.1. Graph Filtering: Key Insight
After constructing a correspondence graph, we go into the
second part of Fig. 2. Our objective is to extract the high-
frequency component of the generalized degree signal (de-gree later for brevity), allowing us to sample the nodes inthe graph where the degree undergoes rapid changes. Thissection will highlight the reasons for doing so. We start byanalysing the frequency of the degree distribution, and inparticular its relation to cliques, as shown in Fig. 3.
In order to explore the relationship between the degree
signal frequency and cliques, we investigated the responseof the degree signal to a high-pass ﬁlter, which is im-
plemented with Laplacian matrix as mentioned above, on
crafted (not generated from realistic data) connected cave-man graphs[ 63]. Note that our focus is on the degree fre-
quency, a local feature determined solely by the neighbor-ing nodes. By prioritizing this local feature, we can simplifyother types of graphs into the connected caveman graph,which will be explained later.
As illustrated in Fig. 3, nodes with high response exhibit
certain properties. If we consider each clique as a commu-nity, then: 1.In every community, there must exist a nodeto generate strong response. 2.There are a sufﬁcient num-ber of nodes within a community that can elicit a strong re-sponse. 3.Nodes with signiﬁcant response lie on the periph-ery of each community and are susceptible to consitutingcut points. They have links not only with nodes within theirrespective community but also with nodes in other ones.
These properties prompt the idea of sampling the high-
frequency nodes. Maximal Clique registration process in-volves searching all maximal cliques in the correspondencegraph, generating hypothesis for each maximal clique and
selecting the best one. Suppose the output samples con-sist of high-frequency nodes, then: 1. since such nodes
must exist in every community, they can cover nearly ev-ery maximal clique. 2. A sufﬁcient number of samples ineach clique guarantees the ability to generate a hypothesis.
3. Considering link between nodes represents compatibil-ity, the selected correspondences are not only compatiblewith the correspondences within their own clique, but alsowith some others, indicating that these correspondences are
more reliable and thus generating better hypotheses.
Now we explain why the features seen in the connected
caveman graph can apply to other graphs. In a typical graph,cliques are either mutually connected or not. Mutually con-nected cliques maintain similar local properties of a con-nected caveman graph, whereas isolated cliques exhibit dis-tinct features. Nevertheless, isolated cliques are rare andoften negligible in the scenario of graph-based registration.
3.2. Graph Filtering: Formulation
High-pass. Guided by the aforementioned insight, we pro-
pose to selectively sample the high-frequency nodes by ﬁrstformulating the graph ﬁlter. There are three typical graph
ﬁlters: high-pass, low-pass and all-pass. A simple design of
high-pass ﬁlter is a Haar-like high-pass graph ﬁlter:
H=I−A=V⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎣1−λ
10...0
01−λ2...0
......
00 ...1−λN⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎦V−1
(1)
whereAis a normalized graph shift as deﬁned in Ap-
pendix A.1., Vandλiare the corresponding eigenvectors
and eigenvalues. Note that λmax=1and if we order λiin a
descending order, we have 1−λi≤1−λi+1, indicating low
frequency response attenuates and high frequency responseampliﬁes. A detailed interpretation is given in [ 11].
Low-pass. The opposite of this is a the Haar-like low-
pass graph ﬁlter, that is
H=I+1
|λmax|A
=V⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣1+λ1
|λmax|0... 0
01 +λ2
|λmax|... 0
......
00 ...1+λN
|λmax|⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦V−1
(2)
All-pass. An all-pass graph ﬁlter is simple: H=I. The
all-pass ﬁlter keeps all information of the degree signal andintuitively samples those nodes with large degrees.
For correspondence graph. When it comes to our ﬁl-
ter, we ﬁrst compute the generalized degree signal s=
[s
1,s2,...,s N]T∈CN×1wheresi=/summationtext
jWSOG ij, and
Nis the size of correspondence set. Then a high-pass graph
ﬁlter is adopted to ﬁlter the high frequency information ofs.F o rG
corr, we deﬁne the high-pass graph ﬁlter as:
H=D i a g (s)−WSOG, (3)
17860
or the Laplacian Matrix of the correspondence graph. In
the graph vertex domain, the output for a signal X=(xi),
(HX)i=sixi−/summationtext
j∈N iWSOG ijxjreﬂects the difference
between a node and the combination of its neighbors.
Then we have the response of signal scorresponding to
Hasf=Hs. We further compute the response magnitude:
πi=||fi||2
2which quantiﬁes the energy of the signal on
each node after high-pass graph ﬁltering. It reﬂects howmuch information we know about a signal value on the nodefrom its neighbors in the graph.
3.3. Stochastic Sampling
Sampling operator deﬁnition. After obtaining the re-
sponse magnitude of each node to the graph ﬁlter as shownin Fig. 2, we perform sampling based on this response mag-
nitude. Suppose we aim to sample mcomponents of a
graph signal x=Hs∈C
nto produce a sampled signal
y=xM∈Cm, whereMis the set of sampled indices. The
sampling operator Ψis deﬁned as a linear mapping from Cn
toCm,Ψij=δj,Miand the interpolation operator Φis de-
ﬁned as a linear mapping from CmtoCn:
y=xM=Ψx, (4a)
x/prime=Φy=Φ Ψx, (4b)
wherex/prime∈Cnis the recovery of the original signal. A
properly designed sampling operator Ψaims to minimize
the reconstruction error ||x−x/prime||.
Non-stochastic methods attempt to create a well-
designed deterministic sampling operator Ψ.[10] ﬁnds the
optimal sampling operator:
Ψopt=a r gm a x
Ψσmin(ΨV(K)), (5)
whereσminmeans the smallest singular value and V(K)rep-
resents the independent columns in the eigenvectors Vof
the graph shift A. In practice, a greedy algorithm [ 10]i s
used to ﬁnd an approximate solution. It maintains M, a set
of rows of V(K), and loops to ﬁnd another row rinV(K)
to maximize σminof the matrix formed by M+{r}until
|M|meets the termination condition. However, it is ex-
tremely slow when processing large matrices, as it involvesa number of SVD decompositions with a total complexity
ofO(MN
3+M3N)whereMis the sample size and Nis
the original size. Proof will be given in 5.2.
Stochastic sampling. By contrast, we adopt a stochastic
strategy. We consider πifetched from Graph Filtering as
a sampling distribution and apply probability sampling onthe initial correspondence set, resulting in a sampled set de-
noted asC
sampled .πiapproximates the sampling operator
Ψand it is optimal in terms of minimizing the reconstruc-
tion error, according to proof in [ 11], and is much faster,
which will be proved in 5.2. A detailed proof of optimality
is given in Appendix.A.5.

4. Experiments
For information about datasets, evaluation metrics and im-
plementation details, please refer to the Appendix A.6.
4.1. Time-Accuracy Trade-off Comparison
We perform an extensive comparison in Fig. 1. The cor-
respondence based registration methods are presented forcomparison. All methods are tested on the KITTI datasetwith FCGF as the correspondence generation descriptor.
Fig. 1demonstrates RR performance of different meth-
ods. Our FastMAC can outperform all other methods
even with a sample ratio as low as 5%. It runs nearly
80 times faster than methods with comparable RR perfor-
mance, and achieves a 40% higher RR when compared to
methods that are almost as fast as it. Moreover, when sam-pling ratio declines to 20%, our method runs at real-time
level, with a single registration requires less than 35ms.
4.2. Sampling Strategy Comparison
We also compare our method with different sampling strate-gies. This demonstrates that the MAC itself is still sensitiveto the number of correspondences, thus showing that ourmethod is superior and suited for Maximal Clique regis-tration. The sampling strategies for comparison are Ran-dom Sampling and Furthest Point Sampling(FPS). Notably,a correspondence is not a traditional 3D point and we deﬁnetheir distance as the euclidean distance in 6D space. BothFPFH and FCGF descriptor are tested.
Results on KITTI Dataset: Fig. 4shows results of
FPFH and FCGF settings on KITTI Dataset. Our methodmaintains a consistent RR, RE and TE when sampling ra-tio declines from 100% to 5% and only becomes slightly

worse at the 1%. By comparison, Random Sampling and
FPS strategy show rapid deterioration in performance. It’sworth noticing that FPS behaves even worse than Randomstrategy, suggesting that a 6-dimensional vector space withEuclidean distance is ill-suited for the correspondence set.Another notable point is that the FPS performance showsdramatic ﬂuctuations, indicating lack of robustness.
Results on 3DMatch Dataset: As shown in Fig. 5,
our method still works well. Though the Random Strategyperforms closely to our method on RE and TE, it has a muchlower success rate. This means Random Strategy has a highperformance on only a few point cloud pairs, which limitsits usage in challenging real-world problems.

4.3. Time Proﬁling
To demonstrate FastMAC’s time efﬁciency, we study on-device time proﬁling to report time consumption. The orig-inal MAC is used for comparison.
Fig. 1depicts our results on KITTI Dataset with FPFH
descriptor. On the right side, we demonstrate time proﬁlingof MAC and FastMAC with a 5% sample ratio . For MAC,Graph Construction and Maximal Cliques Search occupy a
major part of time consumption, pushing the total time to
over 1second. Whilst for FastMAC, they are no longer bot-
tlenecks. Middle shows variation of time taken versus thesample ratio. Sampling gradually became the dominatant
factor, with rest parts being barely time-consuming.
Table 1further presents our ﬁndings on 3DMatch. Ac-
celeration from Sampling negates the time spent during the
process itself. And its time decrease is essentially consistentacross various sample rates, proving its efﬁciency.

Our method is compared with baseline approaches on the3DMatch, 3DLomatch, and KITTI datasets, and the out-comes can be found in Tables 2,3and4. When sampling

at various ratios, FastMAC reports no signiﬁcant decrease
in performance, remaining competitive with other state-of-the-art methods. This showcases the efﬁcacy of our sam-
pling technique, which accelerates the state-of-the-art MACmethod whilst maintaining accuracy.
4.5. Descriptor Robustness
Since our method accepts correspondences as input, itis crucial to demonstrate its ability to work with corre-spondences generated by different descriptors. We per-form extensive experiments with various descriptors, in-
cluding FPFH[ 51], FCGF[ 17], Predator[ 30], Spinnet[ 1],
Coﬁnet[ 69] and Geotransformer[ 49]. These descriptors are
used to generate point-wise features which are subsequentlyused to obtain correspondences. We adopt KITTI as thedataset and the results are presented in Fig. 7.
For RR metric, stronger descriptors like Geotransformer,
Coﬁnet, Spinnet and Predator exhibit amazing excellence,with their RR remaining unaffected by the sample ratio,while FCGF and FPFH perform slightly worse when sam-ple ratio comes to 1%. For RE and TE, most descriptors be-have similarly. These metrics ﬁrst stabilize and then slowlyincrease as the sampling rate decreases. It can therefore beconcluded that our method is highly robust to the correspon-dences produced by different descriptors.Figure 7. Performance on KITTI with various descriptors.

5. Ablation Study
In this section, we mainly focus on the analysis of the core
parts of our method, i.e, High-pass Graph Filtering and
Stochastically Sampling . Sincexyzcoordinates of the point
cloud can also be a graph signal and has been widely usedbefore [ 11], we further compare xyzsignal with our gener-
alized degree signal to demonstrate our superiority.
5.1. High-pass, Low-pass and All-pass Filter
In this part, we compare our high-pass ﬁlter with a low-passﬁlter and an all-pass ﬁlter to demonstrate its efﬁcacy. Theﬁlters are implemented as described in 3. For the Haar-like
low-pass ﬁlter, we choose the graph shift Ato beD
−1W
whereDis the generalized degree matrix and Wis the
adjacency matrix. Then we have the sample distributionπ
i=||((I+D−1W)s)i||2in which sis the generalized
degree signal. For the all-pass ﬁlter, the corresponding sam-pling strategy is π
i=||si||2.
We use these types of ﬁlters to sample the correspon-
dences and feed the output into the MAC module. The re-

Figure 8. Left ﬁgure shows how time increases with number of
samples on KITTI FCGF dataset. Right is time proﬁling when
sampling 50 from 5000 correspondences. Preparation : Compu-
tation of the graph shift and the degree score. Sampling :F o r

sult is shown in Table. 5. The high-pass ﬁlter is more effec-
tive , providing evidence to support our intuition. In fact, anall-pass ﬁlter solely samples out nodes with high degrees,whereas a low-pass ﬁlter samples nodes which lie within a
clique. If the clique is big in size, low-pass and all-pass ﬁl-ters function in a manner similar to random sampling. That
is why these two ﬁlters do not function well.
5.2. Stochastic v.s. Non-stochastic
To clarify the efﬁciency of our stochastic method, we willgive both theoretical analysis and experimental analysis.
Theoretical Analysis Since both stochastic and non-
stochastic methods involve computing the signal after ﬁlter-ing, we only analyze operations after the computation. Sup-pose we are sampling Mnodes from the original Nnodes.
Non-stochastic: V
(K)is ﬁrst required for the graph shift
A, which is O(N3)complexity [ 45]. Then we enter the
greedy algorithm which loops for Mtimes. In loop i,
N−itimes of computing the smallest singular value is per-
formed, each using O(N3+(i+1)2N)[29]. After summing
them all, we get the ﬁnal computation complexity
O(N3)+M−1/summationdisplay
i=0O(N3+(i+1)2N)
=O(MN3+M3N)(6)
Stochastic: Our stochastic method simply use the norm
of the ﬁltered signal yas a distribution and samples Mtimes
from it. The time complexity is O(M)+O(N).
Experimental Analysis We present our experimental re-
sults in Fig. 8. The time taken by the stochastic method
Figure 9. Sampling performance on KITTI FCGF with different
degree signal settings. 000: random sampling. 110: sample guided
by xyz signals from source and target pointcloud. 001: sample
guided by our generalized degree signal. 111: sample guided by
simply adding both signals.
remains consistently stable at 15 ms as the sample rate in-
creases. By contrast, the non-stochastic method’s time con-sumption increases in a polynomial trend, necessitating two
days to obtain 2500 samples! This is largely caused by thefrequent, multiple large matrix SVD decompositions.
5.3. XYZ Signal v.s. Generalized Degree Signal
In this section, we compare our generalized degree signalwith xyz signal which are commonly used in point cloudsampling. As we accept correspondences as input, we de-note the source point cloud formed by source points asQ
s∈CN×3and target point cloud Qt∈CN×3. They
are considered as graph signals and pass through a high-pass ﬁlter which is created by KNN adjacency matrix fol-lowing [ 11] to detect their contour points. The response are
denoted as q
s∈CN×3andqt∈CN×3. The response mag-
nitude||qs||2∈CNand||qt||2∈CNare then scaled to 0-1
to form the sampling distribution π1,π2.
Fig.9demonstrates the results of four settings. The sig-
nal of the generalized degree performs the best, while xyzsignal does not differ signiﬁcantly from random sampling.When combined with xyz signal, the performance of gener-alized degree signal gets worse, indicating that the informa-tion within the generalized degree signal is contaminated byxyz signal.
6. Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a stochastic spectral correspon-dence graph sampling method to discover high-frequencynodes, boosting Maximal Clique Registration to real-timelevel with little performance loss. Moreover, it’s robustto various descriptors, showing its potential for usage inreal-time complex applications. Still we have limitations.As shown in Fig. 1, when sample ratio decreases, graph
construction gradually becomes a bottleneck. In the futurewe plan to solve this issue by learning graph prior withoutbuilding a graph, thus eliminating this cost.
