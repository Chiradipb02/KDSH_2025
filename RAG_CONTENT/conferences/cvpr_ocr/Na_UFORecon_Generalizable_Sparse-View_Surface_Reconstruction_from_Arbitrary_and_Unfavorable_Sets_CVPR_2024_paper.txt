Abstract
Generalizable neural implicit surface reconstruction
aims to obtain an accurate underlying geometry given a
limited number of multi-view images from unseen scenes.
However, existing methods select only informative and rel-
evant views using predefined scores for training and test-
ing phases. This constraint makes the model impractical
because we cannot always ensure the availability of favor-
able combinations in real-world scenarios. We observe that
previous methods output degenerate solutions under arbi-
trary and unfavorable sets. Building upon this finding, we
propose UFORecon , a robust view-combination general-
izable surface reconstruction framework. To this end, we
apply cross-view matching transformers to model interac-
tions between source images and build correlation frustums
to capture global correlations. In addition, we explicitly
encode pairwise feature similarities as view-consistent pri-
ors. Our proposed framework largely outperforms previ-
ous methods not only in view-combination generalizabil-
ity but also in the existing generalizable protocol trained
with favorable view-combinations. The code is available at

1. Introduction
Reconstructing 3D geometries from images of multiple
camera viewpoints is a fundamental problem in the com-
puter vision field, also applicable to robotics [6, 28, 49], au-
tonomous driving [13, 22], and AR/VR applications [7, 26].
Multi-view stereo (MVS) is a widely used technique for re-
constructing 3D geometry from multi-view images. Con-
ventional MVS methods [2, 10, 19, 34] find correspon-
dences across input images taken from different viewpoints.
With the recent advances in deep learning, learning-based
MVS methods [3, 8, 11, 44] leverage differentiable ho-
mography warping with 3D Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) to effectively search correspondences in feature
space. Recent progress in 3D reconstruction [15, 30, 45]

respectively. V olRecon [32] leads to a degenerate geometry in the

set. Our approach produces reasonable geometry on both sets.
increasingly emphasizes the use of implicit neural repre-
sentation [27]. This trend is notable in the field of neural
surface reconstruction [29, 38, 46, 48]. Unlike Neural Ra-
diance Fields (NeRF) [27], which employs a volume den-
sity to infer 3D geometry implicitly, the use of Signed Dis-
tance Function (SDF) field has proven to be effective for
learning surfaces because of their universal zero level-set
definition of surfaces. However, as these approaches opti-
mize on a single scene with dense camera viewpoints, there
is an increasing effort to learn a generalizable representa-
tion that can adaptively reconstruct geometry from unseen
scenes with sparse camera viewpoints [23, 25, 32, 43].
Despite the remarkable achievements, existing gener-
alizable implicit surface reconstruction methods use the
fixed, best combination for each camera based on the view-
selection scores [44]. This score is predefined for each
camera pair via a matching-based reconstruction, such as

COLMAP [34]. These favorably selected views usually
share a significant amount of overlaps, which can help the
model easily capture the 3D geometry of the target scene.
We argue that this assumption limits the practicality of sur-
face reconstruction tasks in two key scenarios: (1) where
inferring from arbitrary combinations of camera views that
were not available during training and (2) where the combi-
nation of views share a limited amount of overlapping areas
with each other for reconstruction.
To verify this argument, we start by introducing the
view-combination score ( VCScore) that measures the in-
formativeness of the input image set for reconstruction.
We demonstrate that conventional research gradually faces
higher difficulty as the VCscore decreases. We then intro-
duce our proposed framework, UFORecon, a robust view-
combination generalizable surface reconstruction frame-
work. More specifically, we learn the matching features be-
tween source view images using an attention-based cross-
view transformer. Then, we build a cascaded correlation
frustum based on each source view, effectively combining
MVS with implicit surface reconstruction for robust recon-
struction from varied view combinations. Furthermore, we
encode the explicit similarity for all input pairs and inter-
mediate depths into sample points to predict a 3D represen-
tation. As a result, we achieve effective view-combination
generalizability without additional data or losses. Finally,
we introduce a random set training strategy for robustness
under arbitrary view combinations.
As shown in Figure 1, while existing methods suffer
from degraded performance under the unfavorable set, our
proposed method achieves a reasonable geometry. We at-
tribute this to our method’s capability to learn the correla-
tion among source view images.
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
• We propose a new concept of view-combination general-
izability , which represents an ability to reconstruct geom-
etry under arbitrary and unfavorable views, in generaliz-
able neural scene representation.
• We propose an effective model that integrates cross-view
features with correlation volumes and explicit feature
similarities to learn cross-view interaction and reconstruct
under arbitrary and unfavorable sets.
• We validate the efficacy of random set training as a ro-
bust strategy to stably enhance view-combination gener-
alizability.
2. Related Works
2.1. Depth Map-based Multi-view Stereo
Multi-view stereo (MVS) is a branch of the 3D recon-
struction task that estimates the underlying geometry of a
scene or an object given images captured from multiple
views. The common method for classical MVS is findingcorrespondence or matching features of multi-view images
and projecting them into a certain 3D representation [36].
Among various representations ( e.g., point clouds [9, 20],
voxel grids [14, 16], depths map [2, 10, 33]), depths map-
based MVS has shown to be effective in recent learning-
based MVS thanks to their robustness and flexibility. MVS-
Net [44] proposes to encode camera parameters and deep
image features with differentiable homography to build 3D
cost volume. CasMVSNet [11] further reduces the mem-
ory consumption of the cost volume by proposing a coarse-
to-fine multi-stage depth estimation framework. Trans-
MVSNet [8] proposes a feature-matching transformer to
extract cross-view correlation and robust global context
across multi-view images. Though these methods have
shown promising results, they show limited results in non-
Lambertian regions, and their estimation capability is lim-
ited to estimating the depths of known images, while vol-
ume rendering-based implicit methods could render color
or depth images of novel viewpoints.
2.2. Implicit Neural Scene Reconstruction
Implicit neural representations for 3D scenes have gained
significant attention since NeRF [27], which represents
the 3D scene as an implicit continuous signal, approxi-
mated with neural networks, e.g., multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs). Especially in surface reconstruction, NeuS [38]
and V olSDF [46] exploit implicit neural representations
for signed distance fields (SDFs) in 3D scenes. Utiliz-
ing geometric cues [48] (e.g., depth, normal) or adding
constraints [35] has proven effective in sparse-view re-
construction. However, these approaches barely consider
the relationship among source views and involve inten-
sive test-time optimization. To address this, generalizable
neural scene representation methods construct feature vol-
umes [4, 47] or aggregate source views using transformer
attention modules [31, 39]. Particularly for surface recon-
struction, SparseNeuS [25] constructs hierarchical feature
volumes using deep image features to enable geometry-
aware reasoning. V olRecon [32] and ReTR [23] utilize
transformers to effectively fuse multi-view image features.
C2F2NeuS [43] effectively integrates MVS and implicit
surface reconstruction by building cascaded frustum to en-
code global geometry features. However, these methods’
performance is often bounded by camera sets with large
overlaps and exhibits sensitivity to viewpoint variations. In
our research, we model feature correlation among images
and employ view-consistent matching prior to effectively
handling arbitrary or unfavorable view sets.
2.3. Feature Matching Transformer
Transformers, which primarily utilize attention mecha-
nisms [37], have been increasingly employed in diverse
3D understanding applications. Notable among these are

transformer-based MVS methods introduced by STTR [21],
MVSTER [40], and TransMVSNet [8]. These methods
significantly improve feature matching by employing both
self- and cross-attention techniques to effectively train on
features from multiple viewpoints. Other than the MVS
methods, GMFlow [41] exploits a similar transformer-
based architecture to estimate optical flow by reformulat-
ing the estimation as a global image feature-matching prob-
lem between frames. More recently, MatchNeRF [5] in-
troduces cross-view feature matching from the pre-trained
transformer in GMFlow [41] as an explicit geometry guid-
ance for generalizable Novel View Synthesis (NVS). De-
spite these advancements, the exploration of cross-view fea-
ture matching in implicit 3D reconstruction remains under-
developed. Our approach effectively combines transformer-
based feature correlation with neural implicit surface meth-
ods, significantly enhancing view-combination generaliz-
ability and 3D reconstruction.
3. Motivation
The existing generalizable methods adhere to two critical
assumptions that limit their ability to effectively reconstruct
from varying view combinations. The assumptions are:
1) The network is trained on images with the best view-
selection scores for the specific target view. 2) The eval-
uation similarly assumes the favorable combination for re-
construction by selecting the source cameras with high view
selection scores or selecting the neighboring cameras to the
target camera. We define a property of a view-combination
that deviates from such assumptions as unfavorable . In con-
trast, favorable combinations tend to share a relatively largeoverlap in their camera view frustum, and the respective
camera positions are likely to be cluttered ( i.e., small base-
line and rotation). We observe that a network trained only
with such combinations easily overfits, restricting general-
izability under arbitrary view-combination variations.
To measure the effectiveness of a view-combination
for the reconstruction, we define a new metric, view-
combination score (VCscore), to evaluate the collective
informativeness of a viewpoints combination for 3D re-
construction. We derive the score from view selection
score [44], which represents the usefulness of an image pair
for reconstruction. The view selection score [44] s(i, j)be-
tween two cameras iandjare defined as follows:
s(i, j) =X
p(G(θij(p)), (1)
where Gis a piecewise Gaussian function that favors a cer-
tain baseline angle θij, which denotes the angle between the
two camera centers. pis a common track in both view iand
jobtained with COLMAP [34]. The complete derivation
process of the view-selection score and the hyperparame-
ters is thoroughly detailed in the Appendix. We extend it
to a set of multiple images by averaging all of the pairwise
scores between images in the set as follows:
VC=1 n
2n−1X
i=1nX
j=i+1s(i, j). (2)
To show the validity of the VC score and verify the con-
ventional approach suffers from the degradation of perfor-
mance under unfavorable combinations, we test the view-
generalizability of the previous approach in various VC
score levels. As depicted in Figure 2, Chamfer Distance
(CD) incrementally rises as the VC score reduces in the pre-
vious state-of-the-art (SoTA) reconstruction method [32].
Such result reflects the necessity of providing a prior on
the informativeness of image combination for robust recon-
struction. Inspired by these findings, our objective centers
on enhancing view-combination generalizability by provid-
ing cross-view correlation features as robust prior for the
image combination, boosting the quality of reconstructions
under arbitrary and unfavorable sets of images.
4. Methods
In this section, we first introduce the general formulations of
volume rendering-based generalizable surface reconstruc-
tion (Sec. 4.1). Then, we introduce the overall struc-
ture of our proposed UFORecon (Figure 3) which consists
of cross-view matching feature extraction (Sec. 4.2), cas-
caded correlation volume generation strategy (Sec. 4.3) that
encodes global geometry across input views, explicit 2D
geometry-aware matching priors (Sec. 4.4) that provides ro-
bust view-pair guidance, and view aggregation transformer

self-attention transformers. Finally, we introduce our train-
ing schemes (Sec. 4.6).
4.1. Preliminaries
The goal of generalizable neural surface reconstruction is to
reconstruct the underlying geometry of an arbitrary scene
with the posed images {Ii, Pi}N
i=1where Ii∈RH×W×3
is the i-th view’s image and Pi∈R3×4is the correspond-
ing camera parameters. A general framework extracts fea-
tures from 2D images and builds a global feature volume
[23, 25, 32, 43]. Then the NeRF-like MLP decoder lever-
ages these features with interpolation to guide 3D represen-
tations ( e.g., radiance, SDF). To generalize through scenes
and to enable sparse-view inference, a limited number of
source images ( e.g.,N= 3) are utilized to synthesize a tar-
get image during training. Along a ray emitted from a given
pixel coordinate in the target image, M3D points are sam-
pled as {pm=r(tm) =o+tmv, m= 1, ..., M }, where o
andvdenote the ray origin and direction respectively. To es-
timate the color and SDF value of 3D point pm, we acquire
the corresponding image features and volume features. We
project pmonto the source image Iiasπi(pm)and obtain
the corresponding image feature fimg
iwith bilinear interpola-
tion. In addition, the volume features fvolare obtained with
trilinear interpolation at the normalized position. The color
of the 3D position cmis determined as a weighted sum of
image pixel colors Ii(pm), where the weights are estimated

where tm≤tm+1. The derivation of ρ(t)commonly fol-
lows the original definition in NeuS [38] or V olSDF [46].
4.2. Cross-View Matching Transformer
When input views become sparse, where the 3D space is
under-constrained, it is important to identify correlations
between the input views [35]. Furthermore, as we assume
that a view combination can be different, uncovering the re-
lationships between input images and using them as recon-
struction priors becomes more crucial for view-combination
generalizability. While most existing neural surface recon-
struction methods extract image features independently, re-
cent works [8, 42] have shown significant results by explic-
itly extracting cross-view correlation features of an input
pair of images using transformer-based feature matching.
We initially extract multi-scale features ϕl
iindepen-
dently for each image Iiusing a Feature Pyramid Network
(FPN) [24]. For each level l, the hierarchical features are
then processed through a cross-view matching transformer

purposes: 1) to construct correlation frustums that learn
global implicit correlations among multi-view source im-
ages (Sec. 4.3), and 2) to extract explicit feature similar-
ity scores (Sec. 4.4) for all source image pairs. Since both
branches learn the correlation between source images, the
framework seamlessly integrates the two parts with interde-
pendent objectives, effectively serving as a global matching
encoder.
4.3. Cascaded Cross-View Correlation Frustum
Motivated by recent MVS methods that have shown the
effectiveness of cost volume integration in generalizing
sparse-view inference from arbitrary unseen scenes, we
build a cascaded global volume with correlation features [8]
to provide cross-view information. Our model constructs
perspective frustums instead of regular Euclidean volumes
for each source view by setting each view as a reference fol-
lowing C2F2NeUS [43]. For each reference image Ii, we
align rest of the source images using differentiable warp-
ing to obtain total Npairwise correlation frustums Cl
i∈
R1×d×h×wfor all levels Las follows:

view matching transformer, and d,h, and wdenote the res-
olution of the volume. We deliver the detailed aggregation
of correlation volumes in the Appendix. Multi-level cor-
relation frustums are processed with 3D CNNs and out-
put intermediate volumes Vl
i∈Rc×d×h×wand depths
Dl
i∈R1×h×w. The intermediate volumes Vl
i, initially
tailored for depth estimation, are transformed with addi-
tional 3D CNNs to generate V′l
i. We output our global
feature volumes by adding V′l
ifrom all source views as
V′l=PN
i=1V′l
i, serving as a global correlation. Our cor-
relation frustum is different from C2F2NeUS [43] in that
we additionally utilize cross-view matching features from
transformers and single-channel correlation frustums with
much lower memory cost. Furthermore, we believe that
correlation volumes guide our model to leverage the inher-
ent geometrical relationships between different views ex-
tensively.
4.4. Geometry-aware Similarity Encoding
Recently, correspondence matching information on 2D has
shown to be useful for 3D understanding [5, 41]. To fur-
ther guide our network for view-combination generalizabil-
ity, we explicitly encode cosine similarity for all possible
source pairs. We use the extracted cross-view features for
all N
2
pairs from the cross-view matching transformer. We
only use the coarsest feature for similarity encoding.To obtain the 2D cross-view features for the sampled 3D
points pm, we project the 3D points onto the 2D cross-view
matching features F0
iandF0
jand acquire the corresponding
features fi=F0
i(πi(pm))andfj=F0
j(πj(pm)). After
that, we calculate the cosine similarity of the two vectors
ˆs= cos( fi,fj)in a group-wise manner [12]. We average
the cosine similarities for all pairs and obtain encoded sim-
ilarity vector fs, allowing the dimension invariant to input
source images. Given an arbitrary view combination for
inference, the explicit similarity scores provide a robust ge-
ometry prior, regularizing the feature space for matching.
4.5. Reconstruction Transformers
View-aggregation Transformer. We combine global cor-
relation from our correlation frustums, cross-view matching
features, and similarity scores using our view-aggregation
transformer TA. We acquire 2D cross-view matching fea-
tures and similarity scores for all sampled points in the 3D
space by projecting the points onto each image view and ap-
plying bilinear interpolation. Additionally, we employ tri-
linear interpolation on the points to feature volumes V′lto
obtain global correlation features. Finally, we add a learn-
able token feature f0to capture global consistent rendering
features as in [23, 32]. All features above are aggregated
via linear self-attention transformers [17, 37]:
fp,{f′
i}N
i=1=TA(f0,{fi}N
i=1,fv,fs), (7)
where fpis a projection vector and {f′
i}N
i=1are aggregated
features further used for rendering and fvdenotes the con-
catenated volume features sampled from V′lfor all levels.
Geometry-aware Ray Transformer. To estimate implicit
geometry representation ( e.g.,SDF) along the rays, we first
apply positional encoding to the points along the ray. This is
achieved by calculating the difference between the camera
coordinates of sampled points and the intermediate depth
obtained from the cascaded correlation frustum as in [44].
We then apply positional encoding [17] γ(·)to embed the
order of the ray and to extract geometry-aware features f′
i
with the self-attention linear transformer TRas follows:
{f′
i}M
i=1=TR(fp,cat(γ(zi−zd))M
i=1). (8)
where zidenotes depth values of a i-th sampled point in the
camera coordinate and zddenotes the intermediate depth
value of the ray. We utilize color blending to obtain color
value for each point following [32] and aggregate all points
along the ray with volume rendering as in Eq. 4. We adopt
the method of NeuS [38] to volume render SDF.
4.6. Training of UFORecon
Random Set Training. First, we follow the common proto-
col of training with a pre-determined best view combination
5098
based on the view-selection score [44] and expect gener-
alization to arbitrary or unfavorable camera configurations
not seen during training. Beyond the existing training strat-
egy, we suggest a random set training, which randomly se-
lects Nsource views in the training phase, expecting the
network to handle arbitrary view combinations. A detailed
explanation and evidence are presented in the Appendix.
Loss function. Our loss function is defined as a weighted
sum of two loss functions as:
L=Lcolor +αLdepth, (9)
where Lcolor is formulated to minimize the ground truth
colors and rendered color. Similarly, Ldepth is formulated
to minimize the ground truth depths and rendered depth,
following V olRecon [32].
5. Experiments
In this section, we first explain our experimental settings,
including datasets, baseline, and implementation details
(Sec. 5.1). Second, we qualitatively and quantitatively
evaluate our method on generalizable surface reconstruc-
tion mainly focusing on view-combination generalizability
(Sec. 5.2). Last, we analyze the effectiveness of our indi-
vidual elements (Sec. 5.3).
5.1. Experimental Settings
Datasets. We report our results on the DTU datasets [1], for
the challenging scenario of 3 input views in unseen scenes
following [23, 25, 32, 43]. The DTU dataset comprises
scenes captured from 49 distinct frontal viewpoints, each
accompanied by its respective camera matrix. We use 3
source views from each test scene to build a combination
and evaluate the generalization ability of our method. For
all possible view combinations, we calculate the VC scores
and rank them based on the scores in descending order. Sub-
sequently, we evenly divide these combinations into three
groups: favorable ,normal , and unfavorable .
Baseline. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
we mainly compare it with (1) SparseNeus [25], V olRecon
[32], ReTR [23], and C2F2NeuS [43] the state-of-the-art
generalizable neural implicit reconstruction method. For
evaluating scene and viewpoints generalizability, we addi-
tionally compare with (2) Generalizable neural rendering
methods [4, 39, 47], and (3) Neural implicit reconstruction
[38, 46] which require per-scene training. Additionally, we
include (4) traditional MVS methods [8, 34].
Implementation Details. In training, we take N= 4
source images and one target image with the resolution of
640×512. We train the network in an end-to-end man-
ner with Adam optimizer [18] on a single RTX 4090 GPU.
The learning rate is set to 1e-4. We use a hierarchical sam-
pling strategy in both training and testing with 64 points forboth coarse and fine sampling. For global feature volume,
we use L= 3 for cascaded strategy and follow the resolu-
tion of TransMVSNet [8] and set the number of depth hy-
potheses for each level to 48, 32, and 8 respectively. More
implementation details can be found in the Appendix.
5.2. Evaluation on Surface Reconstruction
Chamfer Distance (CD) is used as an evaluation metric in
all experiments. Note that for fair comparisons, our train-
ing adheres to the pre-determined best view combinations,
aligning with the existing protocols [23, 25, 32, 43] unless
otherwise specified.
Reconstruction on Favorable Sets. Following the existing
best-selected test protocol [23, 25, 32, 43], we evaluate with
the fixed favorable views for all test scenes. As shown in Ta-
ble 1, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models
even in the conventional setting. It implies that the superi-
ority of our model is also consistent in all VCscore levels.
Reconstruction on Unfavorable Sets. To analyze the pro-
posed view-combination generalizability, we test with un-
favorable sets. To this end, we sample a view set consist-
ing of 3 images from the unfavorable view group and use
the same set for all 15 test scenes. As shown in Table 2,
our method consistently achieves significantly better per-
formance in all scenes. Our method achieves better view-
combination generalizability by capturing robust prior for
image combination. In addition, we qualitatively compare
our method in various VCscore levels. As shown in Figure
4, ours shows much better reconstruction quality compared
to existing works, particularly showing huge advantages in
unfavorable sets. We further tested with unfavorable sets of
BlendedMVS dataset without fine-tuning as shown in Fig-
ure 5. It shows that our method is generalizable to unfavor-
able view-combinations of other datasets.
5.3. Analysis on UFORecon
Ablation Study. We first perform ablation experiments to
assess the impact of each component within our approach.
Table 3 shows the performance in an unfavorable scenario
as specific components are removed from the framework.
Each component contributes to the overall performance.
Each level of correlation frustum contributes to better per-
formance. Encoding similarity further improves the perfor-
mance even with a full level of correlation frustums. Also,
note that depth supervision plays an important role in our
framework similar to [23, 32].
Analysis on Correlation Frustums. A higher level of frus-
tum encodes relatively finer and local details while a lower
level encodes global geometry features. As shown in Ta-
ble 3, the performance degradation is more severe when ex-
cluding lower levels.
Analysis on Explicit Similarity Encoding. We conduct
a focused analysis on the impact of similarity encoding by

contrasting our approach with a hybrid model. Specifically,
we integrate MatchNeRF [5], known for its utilization of
explicit similarity scores for generalizable rendering, with
V olRecon [32]. This combined model is then tested on both
favorable and unfavorable datasets. As indicated in Table
4, incorporating explicit feature similarity notably enhances
the quality of generalizable surface reconstructions espe-cially in unfavorable conditions. This reflects that explicitly
feature similarity provides robust view-combination prior.
Nevertheless, our proposed approach outperforms in both
favorable and unfavorable conditions, effectively capturing
correlation features with much fewer parameters.
Analysis on Random Set Training. We analyze the ef-
fect of the random set training. We expect the network to
generalize better to various combinations without losing ac-
curacy. As shown in Figure 2, it consistently improves the
reconstruction quality at all VCscore levels. In unfavorable
sets, random set training shows 17% of improvements as
shown in Table 2. Qualitatively, random set training consis-
tently achieves more complete reconstructions as shown in
Figure 6. However, we find that directly applying random
set training on the previous method [32] destabilizes train-
ing dynamics and leads to a suboptimal result. We conjec-
ture that utilizing cross-view correlation features guides the
network to stably improve the reconstruction performance.
6. Conclusion
In this paper, we have introduced a novel concept of view-
combination generalizability in the field of generalizable
implicit surface reconstruction. Our analysis showed that
existing methods tend to overfit to specific learned view
combinations, resulting in suboptimal performance with un-
favorable combinations. To address this challenge, we have
proposed a novel framework, UFORecon, that leverages
cross-view matching features to learn correlation among in-
