Abstract
This paper endeavors to advance the precision of snap-
shot compressive imaging (SCI) reconstruction for multi-spectral image (MSI). To achieve this, we integrate the ad-
vantageous attributes of established SCI techniques and an
image generative model, propose a novel structured zero-
shot diffusion model, dubbed DiffSCI. DiffSCI leverages the
structural insights from the deep prior and optimization-based methodologies, complemented by the generative ca-pabilities offered by the contemporary denoising diffusion
model. Speciﬁcally, ﬁrstly, we employ a pre-trained diffusion
model, which has been trained on a substantial corpus of
RGB images, as the generative denoiser within the Plug-and-
Play framework for the ﬁrst time. This integration allows
for the successful completion of SCI reconstruction, espe-cially in the case that current methods struggle to addresseffectively. Secondly, we systematically account for spec-
tral band correlations and introduce a robust methodology
to mitigate wavelength mismatch, thus enabling seamless
adaptation of the RGB diffusion model to MSIs. Thirdly, an
accelerated algorithm is implemented to expedite the reso-lution of the data subproblem. This augmentation not only
accelerates the convergence rate but also elevates the quality
of the reconstruction process. We present extensive testingto show that DiffSCI exhibits discernible performance en-hancements over prevailing self-supervised and zero-shot
approaches, surpassing even supervised transformer coun-
terparts across both simulated and real datasets. Code is at

1. Introduction
Contrary to conventional RGB images, multispectral images
(MSIs) incorporate an expanded array of spectral bands, en-
abling the retention of more comprehensive and detailed
information. Therefore, MSIs are widely applied in remote
sensing [ 4,21,34,57], medical imaging [ 2,30,36], en-
vironmental monitoring [ 47], etc. Owing to the advance-
ment of snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems [ 9,18,

tion. The RGB image from the same scene serves as the reference.
DiffSCI can reconstruct some unsampled and compressed scene
contents by rethinking SCI through the generative diffusion model.
29,33,50,51,54], it has become feasible to acquire two-
dimensional measurements of MSIs. The decoding stage of
the SCI system aims to reconstruct the three-dimensional
MSIs from its degraded two-dimensional measurement.
Given the ill-posed nature of SCI reconstruction as an
inverse problem, existing methods still face several key chal-
lenges in accurately reconstructing certain aspects. For in-
stance, inadequately illuminated regions or areas with sharp
edges remain problematic as shown in Fig. 1. The underly-
ing reason may be that insufﬁcient sampling occurred in the
above areas, then the reconstruction algorithm may not be
able to accurately recover the detail information. Moreover,
contemporary end-to-end (E2E) models [ 23,35,36,39],
while processing both two-dimensional measurements and
three-dimensional MSIs maps, may inadvertently lose cru-
cial high-dimensional information due to necessary dimen-
sionality reduction. And current unsupervised methods also
fail to achieve satisfactory results. Furthermore, the perfor-
mance of the reconstruction on real-world datasets frequently
deviates from the ideal, primarily attributable to discrep-
ancies between the training dataset and the novel, unseen
testing images, as evidenced in Fig. 1.
Diffusion model [ 12,16,27,42] has demonstrated no-
table proﬁciency in generating content from RGB im-ages [

challenging-to-reconstruct segments holds promise for en-
hancing MSIs SCI results [ 1,12,13,22,44]. Nonetheless,
two signiﬁcant challenges must be confronted: (i)MSIs lack
extensive training data compared to RGB images due to
their broad band spectrum, amplifying temporal and GPUresource requirements for training. Consequently, directly
training a diffusion model on MSIs is a formidable task. (ii)
Utilizing pre-trained diffusion models, primarily trained on
large RGB datasets with three channels, poses challenges
for MSI reconstruction due to their extensive band spectrum.
The task involves decoding a spatial-spectral MSI from a
single measurement, presenting signiﬁcant differences in in-
put and output dimensions. Consequently, directly applying
diffusion models to MSI reconstruction is non-trivial.
Plug-and-Play (PnP) [ 10,37,43,55,56,58] framework
incorporates pre-trained denoising networks into traditional
model-based methods, due to its interpretability of the prin-
ciples underlying SCI and its ﬂexibility across different SCI
systems, has emerged as one of the most predominant recon-
struction techniques in the current scenario. Also because
the noise type in the iterative steps is additive Gaussian noise
with variance σ2
n[49], we thought of using PnP framework to
apply the pre-trained diffusion model based on massive RGB
images as denoiser to the reconstruction of MSIs. However,
there are four key challenges to embedding the diffusion
model into MSIs at present. (i)It is impossible to input MSIs
involving dozens of spectral bands directly into existing dif-
fusion models pre-trained on RGB images. (ii)There exists
a spectral connection among the bands of MSIs, and many
existing denoisers trained on RGB do not have a good grasp
of this connection. (iii) The wavelength range of RGB im-
ages is much smaller than that of MSIs, making wavelength
mismatch issues inevitable. This discrepancy could signiﬁ-
cantly impact the performance of the diffusion model. (iv)
The sampling time required by the diffusion model in RGB
images is already substantial. For our MSIs problem, the
time required will be even greater. In order to address these
challenges, this paper makes the following contributions:
•Initially, the proposed DiffSCI leverages a diffusion model
trained on a substantial corpus of RGB images for multi-
spectral SCI reconstruction through the PnP framework,
harnessing its generative potential to enhance SCI restora-
tion outcomes. This is the ﬁrst attempt to ﬁll the research
gap to fuse the diffusion model into the PnP framework
for multispectral SCI.
•Acknowledging the inherent spectral band correlations in
MSIs that are not present in RGB images, we embark on a
comprehensive modeling of spectral correlation.
•We introduce a method to address the inevitable issue of
wavelength mismatch, given the broader spectral range of
MSIs compared to RGB images.
•We implement an accelerated strategy to get the analytic
solution of the data subproblem within DiffSCI, whichimproves the convergence rate and reconstruction quality.
We validate DiffSCI through experiments on simulated
and real datasets. Comparative assessments with state-of-the-
art methods conﬁrm DiffSCI’s superior efﬁciency in restor-
ing MSIs, as demonstrated by visual examples in Fig. 1.
2. Background
2.1. Degradation Model of CASSI
In Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Compressive Imag-
ing (CASSI) systems [ 19,35,50], two-dimensional mea-
surements Y∈RH×(W+d×(B−1))can be modulated from
three-dimensional MSI X∈RH×W×Bas shown in Fig. 2,
whereH,W,d andBdenote the MSI’s height, width, shift-
ing step and total number of wavelengths. As [ 8,32], we
denote the vectorized measurement y∈Rnwithn=
H(W+d(B−1)). Then, given vectorized shifted MSI
x∈RnBand mask Φ∈Rn×nB, the degradation model can
be formulated as:
y=Φx+n, (1)
wheren∈Rnrepresents the noise on measurement. SCI
reconstruction is to obtain xfrom the captured yand the
pre-setΦusing a reconstruction algorithm [ 17,26,48].
2.2. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
Diffusion model includes two processes: forward process and
reverse process. The forward process is to continuously add
Gaussian noise to the clean image ( x0) and eventually turn
the initial image into pure Gaussian noise. Thus sampling xt
at any given timestep tcan be formulated as [ 22]:
xt=√¯αtx0+√
1−¯αt/epsilon1, (2)
whereαt=1−βt,¯αt=/producttextt
k=1αk,/epsilon1∼N(0,I)andβt
is a gradually increasing arithmetic sequence. The reverse
process is to gradually restore a clean image from Gaussian
noise. One reverse step of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic
Models (DDPM) is [ 22]:
xt−1=1√αt(xt−βt√1−¯αt/epsilon1θ(xt,t))+/radicalbig
βt/epsilon1t, (3)
where/epsilon1θ(xt,t)is the noise predicted by the network at tth
step and/epsilon1tis standard Gaussian noise. Brieﬂy, DDPM can be
interpreted as a process of gradually subtracting the predicted
noise from xtto restore a clean image x0.
2.3. Score-based Diffusion Model
Compared to DDPM, the score-based model can use methods
like Langevin dynamics for more efﬁcient sampling [ 46],
and at the same time learn the data distribution (i.e., score
function) under various noise levels, thus acquiring more
training signals. This could help to improve the performance

of the model. The forward process can also be described in
the form of a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE):
dx=f(x,t)dt+g(t)dw, (4)
wheredwis inﬁnitesimal white noise, f(·,t)is a vector func-
tion called the drift coefﬁcient, and g(·,t)is a real-valued
function called the diffusion coefﬁcient. The reverse process
can be written as:
dx=[f(x,t)−g2(t)∇xlogpt(x)]dt+g(t)dw, (5)
wherept(x)is terminal distribution density [ 1], and the only
unknown part ∇xlogpt(x)can be predicted through a score-
based model sθ(x,t)[25,45].
2.4. Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
In order to accelerate the reverse diffusion process, Denois-
ing Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) generates new sam-
ples with a non-Markovian process. At each step, the model
computes a denoised version of the image and then mixes
this denoised version with some noise to generate the im-
age for the next step. This process allows for more efﬁcient
estimation and sampling of multiple future states within
the same time step, thus improving sampling efﬁciency and
saving time. Therefore, Eq. ( 3) can be rewritten as:
xt−1=√¯αt−1/parenleftbiggxt−√1−¯αt/epsilon1θ(xt,t)√¯αt/parenrightbigg
+/radicalBig
1−¯αt−1−σ2ηt·/epsilon1θ(xt,t)+σηt/epsilon1t,(6)
the term inside the ﬁrst bracket can be treated as denoised
image˜xtpredicted via current xt,σηtcontrols randomness.
2.5. Conditional Diffusion Model
In the context of conditional generation tasks, we are pre-
sented with a condition y, and our objective is to optimize
the probability of p(x|y). Applying Bayes’ theorem, we canrewrite Eq. ( 6)a s[ 46]:
dx=[f(x,t)−g2(t)∇x(logpt(x)+logpt(y|x))]dt+g(t)dw,
(7)
where the unconditionally pre-trained diffusion model
achieves conditional generation by adding a classiﬁer. So
that, given Eq. (7), one step of reverse sampling under condi-
tional circumstances can be accomplished by ﬁrst taking one
reverse sampling step in the unconditional diffusion model,
and then merging it with the conditional constraint.
3. Proposed Method
3.1. Problem Deﬁnition and Solution
Diffusion-based methods could theoretically recover the de-
tails of dark areas better through their powerful generative
ability [ 41,52]. Unfortunately, the existing diffusion-based
methods are mostly designed for RGB images in which the
input and output are with three channels, while the task of
SCI reconstruction involves decoding a complete multi-band
MSI from a single-band measurement. Meanwhile, limited
by the inadequate datasets of MSI and high dimension of the
data, resource consumption required for retraining diffusion
model on MSIs is high. To leverage the generative power
of diffusion models and thus compensate for the shortcom-
ings of current methods, our idea is to insert the pre-trained
diffusion model on RGB images as a denoiser into the PnP
framework to accomplish SCI reconstruction.
There are now four key problems: (i)How can diffusion
models, trained on RGB images, be effectively applied to
MSIs? (ii) How does one capture spectral correlation in
MSIs that do not exist in RGB images? (iii) What strategies
mitigate wavelength mismatching arising from inconsisten-
cies between MSI and RGB wavelengths? (iv) How can fast
and efﬁcient sampling be achieved for MSIs with numerous
bands? To address the above issues, we proposed the DiffSCI
method with three modules: Denoising Diffusion PnP-SCI
Model, Diffusion Adaptation for MSI, and Acceleration Al-
gorithm. See Fig. 2for an overall view.

3.2. Denoising Diffusion PnP-SCI Model
The inversion problem of SCI can be modeled as:
ˆx=a r gm i n
x1
2/bardbly−Φx/bardbl2+λP(x), (8)
whereP(x)denotes diffusion MSI prior, λis a trade-off pa-
rameter. By adopting the half-quadratic splitting (HQS) [ 20]
algorithm and introducing an auxiliary variable z, Eq. (8)can
be solved by iteratively solving following two subproblems:
xk+1=a r gm i n
x/bardbly−Φx/bardbl2+μ/bardblx−zk/bardbl2, (9)
zk+1=a r gm i n
zμ
2/bardblz−xk+1/bardbl2+λP(z). (10)
Closed-form Solution to Data Subproblem. In CASSI
system,ΦTΦis a diagonal matrix [ 8,58], so that by using
matrix inversion theorem (Woodbury matrix identities), the
closed-form solution of Eq. (9)can be easily found with fast
operation guarantee [ 14]:
xk+1=zk+ΦT[y−Φzk]/circledivide[Diag(ΦΦT)+μ],(11)
whereDiag(·)extracts the diagonal elements of the ensured
matrix,/circledivideis the element-wise division of Hadamard division.
Diffusion Models as Generative Denoiser Prior. Unlike
conventional denoisers, diffusion models possess powerful
generative capabilities [ 15]. To utilize this generative capa-
bility, our DiffSCI model explores diffusion as the generative
denoiser prior as shown in Fig. 2to address hard-to-recover
parts of SCI reconstruction, such as low-light and sharp
edges. We ﬁrstly establish the correlation between Eq. (10)
and diffusion model. Let x(b)
kbe a three-channel image cor-
responding to bthband of MSI xk, from Eq. (10)we have:
z(b)
k+1=a r gm i n
z(b)1
2(/radicalbig
λ/μ)2/bardblz(b)−x(b)
k+1/bardbl2+P(z(b)),
(12)
wherez(b)
k+1can be treated as clean image from noisy image
x(b)
k+1with noise level ¯σt=/radicalBig
1−¯αt
¯αt. Letting ¯σt=/radicalbig
λ/μ ,
with∇xP(x)=−∇ xlogp(x)=−sθ(x)[59], Eq. (12)
can be rewritten as:
z(b)
k+1≈x(b)
k+1+1−¯αt
¯αtsθ(x(b)
k+1,t). (13)
Hence, we can perceive z(b)
k+1as the clean three-channel
image˜x(b)
k+1reversed from x(b)
k+1.
3.3. Diffusion Adaptation for MSI
Applying an RGB pre-trained denoising diffusion model di-
rectly to MSI would cause issues such as band number mis-
matching, insufﬁcient spectral correlation, and wavelength
mismatching. This section will investigate these problems.

pendently selecting non-overlapping bands method, (b) spectral cor-
relation modeling, and (c) wavelength matching method of Scene
1 of 3 (out of 28) spectral channels.
Spectral Correlation Modeling. MSIs exhibit spec-
tral correlation between neighboring bands, denoted as
[Bi−1,Bi,Bi+1]. One approach to address this correlation
is to partition the MSIs into distinct, non-overlapping bands,
Ck=[Bi−1,Bi,Bi+1],Ck+1=[Bi+2,Bi+3,Bi+4],(14)
but it just models the part spectral correlation which may
cause pixel jump between Bi+1andBi+2. Here, to model
the spectral correlation, for each band reconstruction, we
extract adjacent bands for combination,
Ck=[Bi−1,Bi,Bi+1],Ck+1=[Bi,Bi+1,Bi+2],(15)
the combined representation serves as the input for the diffu-
sion model. Subsequently, the corresponding band from the
output is selected as the recovered band Rifor the MSIs,
Ri=D(C). (16)
Quality Comparison: The quality ( Q) of the reconstructed
MSIs obtained through the spectral correlation modelingmethod is signiﬁcantly superior compared to individually
selecting non-overlapping bands as shown in Fig. 3, i.e.,
Q(D(C))>Q(D([Bi−1,Bi,Bi+1])). (17)
Wavelength Matching. Based on previous experiments illus-
trated in Fig. 3, it was observed that the reconstruction perfor-
mance of forward bands was signiﬁcantly inferior compared
to later bands. Analyzing the Spectral Bands and Range
within the simulated dataset revealed the division of MSIs
into 28 spectral bands spanning from 450nm to 720nm,
Bands={Bi}28
i=1,λ(Bi)∈[450,720]. (18)
While the spectral bands of the RGB image are only a subset
of these, i.e.,
λ(RGB)={660,520,450}⊂[453,720],RGB⊂MSIs.(19)
Hence, establishing wavelength matching (WM) between
MSIs and RGB images is imperative. In the context of re-
covering bands with wavelengths signiﬁcantly distant from

Enhanced Metrics: Experimental ﬁndings demonstrate sig-
niﬁcant improvement in both PSNR and SSIM when em-
ploying this approach in conjunction with previous spectral
correlation modeling methods, as illustrated in Fig. 3.
3.4. Acceleration Algorithm
Motivated by the fact that the sampling process of diffusion
model is time-consuming and unconditional, we employ an
acceleration algorithm to achieve faster and more efﬁcient
sampling. As mentioned in Eq. (11), current methods usually
calculate residuals by ( y−Φzk), which only uses informa-
tion about the current zkfor iterative updates. As a result,
this approach leads to slow convergence speed and fails to
effectively address the issue of data proximity.
On this basis, we introduce a variable y1, which can
be deﬁned as y1=y1+(y−Φzk), can be treated as
the accumulation of residuals and calculate residuals bycalculating (
y1−Φzk) iteratively. On the one hand, y1
can be used to incorporate more residual information for
updatingz, thereby improving reconstruction quality. On the
other hand, a form similar to Nesterov acceleration [ 40]i s
employed to expedite the convergence speed.
Accumulation of Residuals. Sincey1is updated at each
iteration, it contains all the residual information from pre-
vious iterations. This means that when we update zusing
y1, we are effectively utilizing information from all previous
iterations, not just the most recent one.
Methods Pertaining to Nesterov-Type Acceleration. The
closed-form solution Eq. ( 11) can be rewritten as:
xk+1=zk+ΦT[y1−Φzk]/circledivide[Diag(ΦΦT)+μ](21)
=zk+ΦT[k/summationdisplay
i=1(y−Φzi)−Φzk]/circledivide[Diag(ΦΦT)+μ].
Thus, we can approximate that xk+1 is derived from/summationtextk

as evidenced by experimental comparisons in Fig. 4.

tive step size as the data subproblem and test the effect of

distribution is p(x|y), and estimated clean image can be
used to calculate the noise with condition y, which is ˆ/epsilon1=
1√1−¯αt(xt−√¯αtˆx0(t)). Then, the diffusion expression like
Eq. ( 6) is:
xt−1=√¯αt−1ˆx(t)
0+/radicalBig
1−¯αt−1−σ2ηtˆ/epsilon1+σηt/epsilon1t.(27)
Based on previous experience [ 59], the noise term σηtcould
be set to 0, and hyperparameter ζcan be used to introduce
noise to balance /epsilon1tandˆ/epsilon1, and Eq. ( 27) can be rewritten as:
xt−1=√¯αt−1ˆx(t)
0+/radicalbig
1−¯αt−1(/radicalbig
1−ζˆ/epsilon1+/radicalbig
ζ/epsilon1t),(28)
whereζcontrols the variance of the noise added at each step,
whenζ=0 , our method becomes a deterministic process.
Finally, we summarize the algorithm for DiffSCI-based
MSI reconstruction in Algorithm 1. Further details regarding
the model are presented in the supplementary materials.
4. Experiments
4.1. Experiment Setup
Similar to most existing methods [ 8,23,24,35], we select
10 scenes with spatial size 256 ×256 and 28 bands from
KAIST [ 11] as simulation dataset. Meanwhile, we select 5
MSIs with spatial size 660 ×660 and 28 bands, captured by
the CASSI system for real dataset [ 35], then we crop datablocks of size 256 ×256 for testing. The pre-trained diffusion
model uses a model trained by [ 59].
Parameter Setting. Through all our experiments, we use
the same linear noise schedule {βt}, and DDIM sampling.
The shift step is set to 2. And in the wavelength matching
method, we choose 21thand28thbands to form a three-
channel image. Meanwhile, we set the reverse initial time
step to 600 and set the sampling steps to 20, 100, 200, 300
and 500 respectively for testing. After experiments, we ﬁnd
settingλ=1 5 ,η=1 ,ζ=1 in DDIM process and sc=1
in data proximal subproblem can achieve the best results.
Comparisons with SOTA Methods. We test the perfor-
mance of our proposed DiffSCI method on the simulation
dataset. We compare the results of our DiffSCI method with
15 SOTA methods set up strictly according to the paper code
including three model-based methods (TwIST [ 3], GAP-
TV [ 53], DESCI [ 28]), six E2E methods ( λ-Net [ 39], TSA-
NET [ 35], HDNET [ 23], MST-L [ 5], MST++ [ 7], CST-L-
PLUS [ 6]), three deep unfolding methods (DGSMP [ 24],
GAP-NET [ 38], ADMM-NET [ 32]), two PnP methods (PnP-
CASSI [ 58], DIP-MSI [ 37]) and one tensor network method
(HLRTF [ 31]) on 10 simulation scenes. From Table 1,i tc a n
be observed that our unsupervised method has a signiﬁcant
improvement compared to other unsupervised methods. The
gap between its performance on PSNR and current super-

vised SOTA methods such as MST-L [ 5] and MST++ [ 7]
is also narrowing. Moreover, we do not need to retrain a
model on MSIs. Therefore, the proposed DiffSCI achieves a
balance between ﬂexibility and performance.
4.2. Qualitative Experiments
Results on Simulation Dataset. Fig. 5shows the display
effects of MSI reconstruction between our DiffSCI method
and other SOTA methods on the 8thband ofScene 1 (top)
and21thband ofScene 2 (bottom). From the enlarged part
of theScene 1 image, we can see that our DiffSCI provides
superior visual effects of detailed contents, cleaner textures,
and fewer artifacts compared to other SOTA methods. Fur-
thermore, to demonstrate the powerful generative capabilities
of the diffusion model, we can observe the magniﬁed sec-
tion ofScene 2. Our method makes the edges of the blocks
sharper, the shapes and patterns closer to the GT, whereas
previous methods either generate over-smoothed results thus
losing the complexity of ﬁne-grained structures or introduce
artifacts. This suggests that the generative capabilities of
diffusion can be effectively applied to reconstruct darkerregions, thereby ﬁlling in the gaps in the current method.Fig. 6presents the density-wavelength spectral curves. The
spectral curves from DiffSCI achieve the highest correlation
with the reference curves, even exceeding the performance
of the current leading method, DAUHST-9 [ 8]. This demon-
strates the superiority of our proposed DiffSCI in terms of
spectral-dimension consistency.
Results on Real Dataset. We also test the reconstruction
capability of DiffSCI on real dataset. Fig. 7and Fig. 11show
the visual comparison between DiffSCI and other SOTA
methods. It is evident that our reconstruction results are more
detailed and have fewer artifacts. Compared to the blurred
results reconstructed by other methods, our method Diff-
SCI demonstrates that the generative ability of the diffusion
model can provide good robustness against noise, leading to
enhanced results in MSI reconstruction. More experimental
results are shown in the supplementary materials.
5. Ablation Study
Effects of Acceleration Algorithm. We propose a resid-
ual accumulation method aimed at achieving acceleration.
Through experimentation, employing this accelerated al-
gorithm showcases enhancements not only in convergence
speed but also in performance, maintaining consistent param-
eters. Figure 4demonstrates the impact of the acceleration
algorithm on both PSNR and time, utilizing an identical num-
ber of sampling steps. Evidently, the accelerated algorithm
yields an improvement of 5-6dB in average performance
while expediting convergence.
Effects of tstart .Our DiffSCI can perform the reverse pro-
cess from partially noisy images instead of starting the recov-
ery from pure Gaussian noise. To demonstrate the impact of
tstart on performance brieﬂy, we show how PSNR changes

ments and ﬁnd that our method achieves the best results in
terms of PSNR and SSIM at tstart= 600 .
Effects of Sampling Steps. To study the impact of the num-
ber of sampling steps on the reconstruction quality assess-
ment parameters PSNR and SSIM, and thus balance the
sampling speed with the recovery quality, we conduct experi-
ments with different numbers of sampling steps. As shown in
Fig. 4, we set sampling steps T∈[20,100,200,300,500] .
Effects of λ,ζandsc.DiffSCI has three hyperparameters
λ,ζandsc, which manage the strength of the condition
guidance, the level of noise added at each timestep and the
update step size in data proximity subproblems. As shown

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we are the ﬁrst to integrate diffusion model with
Plug-and-Play algorithm, applying the generative capabili-
ties of the diffusion model to MSI reconstruction, which com-
pensated for the shortcomings of current methods. Specif-
ically, by utilizing the wavelength matching method andHQS method, we successfully applied the HQS-based dif-fusion model, which was pre-trained on RGB images, asa denoising prior in MSI reconstruction. Meanwhile, weintroduced acceleration algorithms when solving the data
subproblem. Experimental results on both simulated and realdatasets highlighted the superior adaptability, efﬁciency, and
applicability of DiffSCI compared to SOTA methods.
