Figure 1. Lodge can parallelly generate extremely long dance. The sections highlighted in green represent the characteristic dance
primitives. These are expressive 8-frame movements that not only support parallel generation but also contains choreographic patterns.
They guide the diffusion network to generate long, expressive dances in parallel while adhering to choreographic rules.
Abstract
We propose Lodge, a network capable of generating ex-
tremely long dance sequences conditioned on given music.
We design Lodge as a two-stage coarse to fine diffusion ar-
chitecture, and propose the characteristic dance primitives
that possess significant expressiveness as intermediate rep-
resentations between two diffusion models. The first stage
is global diffusion, which focuses on comprehending the
coarse-level music-dance correlation and production char-
acteristic dance primitives. In contrast, the second-stage is
the local diffusion, which parallelly generates detailed mo-
tion sequences under the guidance of the dance primitives
and choreographic rules. In addition, we propose a Foot
Refine Block to optimize the contact between the feet and
the ground, enhancing the physical realism of the motion.
Our approach can parallelly generate dance sequences of
extremely long length, striking a balance between global

1. Introduction
Given a piece of long-term music, we aim at generating
high-fidelity and diverse 3D dance motions in an automatic
and efficient manner. An effective solution is desired not
only in many applications e.g. movie and game production,
but also of high potential to inspire dance designers with
novel movements, and improve their productivity.
With rapid advances in generative AI in recent years, ex-
isting methods [19, 23, 33, 39, 40] demonstrated the ability
to generate dance for seconds. However, dance in real ap-
plications often lasts for minutes. Dance performances and
social dance usually last 3 to 5 minutes. Dance theater can
last for more than 15 minutes or even an hour. Therefore,
the extremely long dance generation is becoming increas-

ingly important as the demand for engaging dance content
continues to grow.
However, generating long dance sequences poses a no-
table challenge due to the substantial computational re-
sources needed for training. Therefore, many methods are
based on autoregressive models [14, 22, 39], and continu-
ously generate dance movements based on a relatively small
sliding window. This autoregressive nature accumulates the
model prediction errors as time progresses, and prevents the
model from learning global choreographic patterns. As a re-
sult, motion freezing often occurs after several seconds [52].
There are also some methods [39, 56, 60] maintain a latent
space to represent motion, and combine a autoregressive
based sequence model to learn music-dance paired relation-
ship. However, the compressed latent space with limited
representational capacity also makes these methods prone
to overfitting, resulting in poor generalization and diversity.
Recently, EDGE [46] proposed a diffusion-based dance
generation model. During the denoising process, EDGE
parallelly generate multiple dance segments with overlap
while maintaining consistency between these overlapping
parts using diffusion inpainting [26], and finally splices
these segments into a long dance by linear interpolation.
However, their dances lack an overall choreographic struc-
ture and shows incoherence at the splices points.
In summary, these existing methods regarding dance
generation solely as a sequence-to-sequence problem. They
struggle to enhance the dance quality of fine-grained local
details while neglect the coarse-level global choreography
patterns between music and dance. Referring to [1, 4, 5, 43],
dance is normally choreographed in a coarse-to-fine man-
ner. Provided the entire music, dance designers first ana-
lyze the music attributes such as rhythm, genre and emo-
tional tone, and create “dance phrases”, i.e. some short-
term expressive movements, which possess powerful ex-
pressiveness and richer semantic information. During this
stage, dance designers can concentrate on design character-
istic dance phrases, such as “inversions’ and “moonwalks”.
Arrange these characteristic dance phrases follow the struc-
tured information of the music, the overall dance structure
is laid down. Subsequently, the entire dance is created by
connecting dance phrases with transition movements.
Following the above insights, we think that the “dance
phrases” contains abundant distinctive movements and can
convey global choreographic patterns. Therefore, similar to
dance phrases, we propose characteristic dance primitives
suitable for network learning. These dance primitives are
expressive 8-frame key motions with high kinematic energy,
with the following main advantages: (1) They are sparse,
which reduce the computational demand. (2) They have rich
semantically information, and can transfer choreographic
patterns. (3) They possess expressive motion characteris-
tics, which can guide motion diffusion model to generatemore dynamic movements and avoiding monotony.
Next, we design a coarse-to-fine dance generation frame-
work with two motion diffusion models and employ the
characteristic dance primitives as their intermediate repre-
sentation. The first stage is coarse-grained global diffusion,
which takes as input long music and produces characteris-
tic dance primitives. According to the fundamental chore-
ographic rules, details in Sec. 3, these dance primitives are
further augmented to align with the beats and structural in-
formation of the music. Subsequently, we employ parallel
local diffusion to independently generate short dance seg-
ments. Based on some auto-selected dance primitives, we
utilize diffusion guidance to strictly constrain consistency
between the beginnings and ends of these segments. There-
fore, these dance segments can be concatenated into a con-
tinuous long dance. Simultaneously, under the guidance of
the other dance primitives, the quality, expressiveness, and
diversity of each dance segment are enhanced.
In addition, to improve the motion realism and eliminate
foot-skating artifacts, we introduce a foot refine block in-
spired by [57]. We find it is difficult to simply use foot-
related losses [54] to optimize the SMPL [25] format mo-
tion rotation data, especially in complex dance movements.
This is because the optimization objective exists in the lin-
ear joint position space while the SMPL format rotation data
is mainly in nonlinear rotation space, and there is a domain
gap hindering loss convergence. Therefore, we compute
foot contact information and utilize the foot refine block to
generate modification values addressing foot skating.
In summary, our main contributions are as follows:
• We introduce a coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that
can produce long dances in a parallel manner. Our
method is capable of learning the overall choreographic
patterns while ensuring the quality of local movements.
• We propose the characteristic dance primitives that pos-
sess significant expressiveness as intermediate represen-
tations between two diffusion models.
• We propose a foot refine block and employ a foot-ground
contact loss to eliminate artifacts such as skating, floating,
and ground inter-penetration.

2.1. Human Motion Synthesis
Human motion generation is an important task in the
fields of computer vision and computer graphics. Re-
searchers make significant contributions in this direction.
For instance, MDM [45] successfully applies diffusion to
the Text2Motion task, yielding high-quality motion re-
sults; GestureDiffuCLIP Ao et al. [2] achieves coordi-
nated motion generation with speech and integrates style
control through text and video guidance; SAGA[48] and
Grasping[17] focuses on natural grasping motion genera-
1525
tion; [16, 55, 58] can produce human motions that inter-
act with 3D scenes while avoiding collisions. CALM [44]
and ASE [35] introduce reinforcement learning and physi-
cal simulation environments to enhance the physical realism
of generated movements. Despite substantial progress in as-
pects like motion quality, diversity, controllability, interac-
tivity, and physical realism, etc, generating dance motions
remains a challenging problem due to the inherent complex-
ity and long-duration nature of dance movements.
2.2. Music Driven Dance Generation
Numerous studies aim to generate high-quality dance that
synchronizes with the input music. These approaches en-
compass various categories, including motion-graph meth-
ods [6], sequence model based methods [19, 22, 39], VQ-
V AE based methods [39, 60], GAN-base methods [19], and
diffusion based methods [23, 46].
The traditional motion-graph based methods [3, 30, 33]
address this task as a similarity-based retrieval problem,
which limits the diversity and creativity of generations. In
recent years, deep learning models have gained significant
prominence, yielding aesthetically appealing outcomes. In
sequence-based methods, LSTM [13] and Transformer [47]
networks are commonly employed. These networks typi-
cally take as input music and the preceding dance sequence,
predicting the subsequent dance in an autoregressive man-
ner. Li et al. propose FACT[22], which inputs music and
seed motions into a Transformer network, generating new
dance frame by frame in an autoregressive manner, but chal-
lenges such as error accumulation and motion freezing [62]
phenomena persist. Based on VQ-V AE, Bailando incorpo-
rates a reinforcement learning-based action evaluator to op-
timize rhythm, while TM2D encodes the text-paired motion
and music-paired dance into a shared codebook to achieve
semantically controllable dance generation. The advantages
of VQ-V AE lie in its ability to maintain a pre-trained code-
book, ensuring the motion quality of decoded dance se-
quences. But the codebook also limits dance diversity and
hinders the network’s generalization. The Generative Ad-
versarial Network (GAN) consists of a generator and a dis-
criminator, engaged in adversarial training to produce real-
istic data. MNET [19] proposes a transformer-based dance
generator and a multi-genre dance discriminator network
to generate realistic dance clips and achieve genre control.
However, these GAN-based methods suffer from mode col-
lapse and training instability.
In recent years, with the rapid development of neural net-
works [7, 24, 37, 51, 56], Diffusion-based methods make
significant strides in tasks such as image, video, and mo-
tion generation [8, 9, 12, 27–29, 42, 50]. FineDance[23]
and EDGE[46] introduce Diffusion to generate diverse and
high-quality dance clips of seconds, but they only focus
on local motion quality of detailed dance clips and cannotquickly generate long-term dance movements that conform
to the overall choreography rules.
3. Method
3.1. Preliminaries
Music and Dance Representation. Given a music clip, we
follow [22] and employ Librosa [31] to extract the music 2D
feature map m∈RL×35, in which Lis the frame number
and35is the music feature channels with 1-dim envelope,
20-dim MFCC, 12-dim chroma, 1-dim one-hot peaks, and
1-dim one-hot beats. In addition, we follow EDGE [46] and
represent dance as d∈RL×139. This motion representation
obeys the SMPL[25] format (without fingers) and consists
of the following components: (1) 4-dim foot-ground contact
binary label, corresponding to left toe, left heel, right toe,
right heel, where 1 means contact with ground and 0 means
no contact; (2) 3-dim root translation; (3) 132-dim rotation
information in 6-dim rotation repersentation [59], the first
6-dim is global rotation and the remaining 126 dimensions
correspond to the relative rotations of 21 sub-joints propa-
gated along the kinematic chain.
The Diffusion Model. We follow DDPM [11] and
EDGE [46] to build our dance generation model. The dif-
fusion model consists of two main processes: a diffusion
process and a denoising process. The diffusion process per-
turbs the ground truth dance data d0intodtovertsteps, we
follow [11] to simplify this multi-step diffusion process into
one step, which can be formulated as:
q(dt|d0) =N(√¯αtd0,(1−¯αt)I), (1)
where ¯αtis within the range of (0,1)and follows a mono-
tonically decreasing schedule. ¯αtconverges to 0astgoes
to infinity, making dtconverging to a sample from the stan-
dard normal distribution. The denoising process employs a
Transformer base-network fθto gradually recover the mo-
tion, generating ˆd0conditioned on given music m. Instead
of predicting the noise [53], we directly predict the ˆd0like
[46]. Therefore, the training process can be formulated as:
Lrecon= E d0,t[∥d0−fθ(dt, t,m)∥2
2]. (2)
Choreography Rules. Based on suggestions from profes-
sional choreographers and existing literature[1, 4, 5, 43],
we want to generate long-duration dances that obeyed these
three basic choreographic rules: (1) The overall genre of the
music and the dance should be consistent, conveying similar
moods and tones. (2) The beat of the music and the dance
should be the same as far as possible. (3) The arrangement
of dance should align with the structure of the accompany-
ing music. For instance, identical meters in a musical phrase
often correspond to symmetrical movements.

3.2. Two-stage Dance Generation
Given a extremely long music feature m∈RL×35, L=
kN, we first split minto segments of length Nwithout
overlaps, i.e.
mi
g∈RN×35	k
i=1. Our goal is to learn a
neural network Loge, di
g=Lodge (mi
g),dg∈RN×139,
d=concatenate (⌈mi
g⌉, dim = 0) , which means Lodge
can parallelly generate extremely long dance sequences d∈
RkN×139with a single inference.
Method Overview. In order to simultaneously consider
both the global choreographic rules and the local dance
details, we design a coarse to fine diffusion network with
two stages as shown in Figure 2. The first stage is the
global diffusion, which uses the global music feature mg
to learn the choreography patterns and produce character-
istic dance primitives. The dance primitives are expressive
key motions mk∈R8×139with a higher motion kinematic
energy, where 8 is the frame number. Then, we perform
choreographic augment operations on these dance primi-
tives by the following three steps: (1) We categorize them
into hard-cue key motions dhthat support parallel gener-
ation and soft-cue key motions dsthat enhance the dance
performance. (2) Based on the second choreographic rule,
we mirror these soft-cue key motions. (3) Based on the third
choreographic rule, we align soft-cue key motions to the
timing of the musical beats.
The second stage is the Local Diffusion (LD), which
focuses on the quality of short-duration nframes dance
generation, corresponding to several seconds. We furthersplit each mginton
mj
l∈Rn×35o⌈N/n⌉
j=1. As shown in
Figure 2, we use the characteristic dance primitives as an
intermediate-level representation of our two-stage diffusion
network. During the inference process, we replace the
movements at the beginning and end of dt, as well as those
at the timing of musical beats, with these dance primitives.
This way, we transfer globally learned choreographic pat-
terns and expressive dance primitives obtained by global
diffusion to local diffusion in a diffusion guidance man-
ner. Specifically, the hard-cue key motion uses the diffu-
sion inpainting technique [26, 46] to control the start and
end movements of the local diffusion. Meanwhile, during
the diffusion denoising process, soft-cue key motions only
serve as guidance in the initial 1000×ssteps, where 1000 is
the diffusion denoising steps. By adjusting the hyperparam-
eter ‘s’, we can control the extent to which local diffusion is
influenced by these soft-cue key motions. Notably, thanks
to the hard cue motions, we can parallelly generate dance
sequences dmuch longer than N with a single inference.
3.3. Global Diffusion
Previous works overlook the global dependencies between
music and dance, focusing only on the music-dance rela-
tionship within a small window. To address this issue, we
only task global diffusion to generate sparse dance primi-
tives. Subsequently, multiple local diffusions work in par-
allel to generate complete long dances.

Librosa[31]. We feed mginto a Transformer downsample
network, which comprises a Linear layer and a Transformer
Encoder Layer. Next, the compressed global music feature
is sent to global diffusion. We adopte the EDGE framework
as the foundation for global diffusion, making a single mod-
ification by adjusting the training objective to output sparse
dance primitives. These primitives are key motions with
only 8 frames, categorized as dhandds.
There are key motions and transition motions in dance,
where key motions are those with velocity curves near lo-
cal minima, displaying greater expressiveness and richer se-
mantic information, while transition motions are relatively
monotonic. To ensure that global diffusion concentrates
solely on generating expressive key motions. We separated
the expressive key movements and monotonous transitional
movements in the dataset and trained global diffusion with
only the expressive key motions. Since the global diffu-
sion learns key motions on a global scale, it already im-
plicitly captures some choreographic patterns. To further
enhance the overall dance coherence, we do choreography
augment operation on ds, guiding the local diffusion to pro-
duce dance that more closely adheres to choreography rules.
3.4. Local Diffusion
Training Process. Thanks to our coarse to fine diffusion
architecture, the local diffusion only needs to train the net-
work on nframes, which greatly accelerates the training
speed and allows local diffusion to focus on the details
of the dance movements for a few seconds. The training
process of local diffusion can be seen in Figure 3. We
follow EDGE to build the Sequence Transformer Block,
which consists of self-attention layer[47], cross-attention
layer[38], multi-layer perception layer and the feature-wise
linear modulation (FilM)[36].In addition to the reconstruction loss, we introduce sev-
eral other losses to enhance training stability and physical
realism like previous works [45, 46]. We compute the po-
sitional coordinates d(i)
jointof the human body joints using
forward kinematics, and then get the joint velocity d(i)
j-vel
and joint acceleration d(i)
j-acc. We then add the following loss
functions: joint position Eq. (4), velocity Eq. (5), and ac-
celeration Eq. (6):

To optimize the contact between feet and the ground, we

Foot Refine Block. The motion is expressed in the SMPL
format, facilitating driven various human models and ren-
dering. However, representing motion in the SMPL for-
mat involves a sequence of relative rotations and motion
tree propagation. Small rotations near the root nodes, such
as the legs and knees, result in significant rotations at the
feet. Especially in dance movements, which involve a vari-
ety of foot actions, these challenges make it difficult for us
to straightforwardly resolve foot skating issues by simply
using foot-related loss functions. We argue the main issue
lies in the domain gap between the optimization objective
and the data representation. The contact status between the
feet and the ground is measured in a linear space based on
joint positions, while the motion in the SMPL format exists
in a nonlinear rotation space. To tackle this, we introduce
the Foot Refine Block inspired by [57]. This module first
computes the positions of foot keypoints foot pthrough
forward kinematics, as well as foot velocity foot v. Then
we calculate the foot-ground contact score foot cfollow
[57]. Building upon this, the Cross Attention mechanism is
employed to further optimize foot movements.
Multi Genre Discriminator. Local diffusion can produce
high-quality, diverse dance segments. As shown in the Fig-
ure 3, to ensure consistency with the overall musical style,
we also concatenate the genre embedding gwith the music
features, resulting in mg
las the condition for local diffu-
sion. We then use a multi-genre discriminator (MGD) to
control the dance genre following MNET[19]. The training
process of MGD can be formulated as:
Lgenre=Eˆdlh

Parallel Inference. Given the input mj
l, gand correspond-
ingdh, ds, the local diffusion outputs dj
l. By concatenat-
ingn
mj
loN/n
j=1along the time dimension, we obtain dg. For
simplicity in description, we omit ‘ j’ in subsequent writing.
To achieve parallel generation of long dance sequences, we
divide dhinto the first four frames and the last four frames.
The first four frames serve as the tail four frames of the pre-
vious dl, and the last four frames of dsserve as the lead-
ing four frames for the next dl. This approach requires
the local diffusion to generate the intervening dance mo-
tions coherently. However, directly using Diffusion inpaint-
ing techniques to control the first and last frames of each
segment results in incoherent motions. To address this is-
sue, we use a joint acceleration loss Lj-accand incorporate
a fine-tuning stage. In this stage, we mixture dtof Local

2]. (10)4. Experiment
4.1. Experimental Setup
Datasets. We validate our method using the public music-
dance paired dataset FineDance[23] and AIST++[22].
FineDance employs professional dancers to perform the
dances and capture the data with an optical motion capture
system. The currently available dance data of FineDance
contains 7.7 hours, totaling 831,600 frames, with a frame
rate of 30 fps, and includes 16 different dance genres. The
average dance length of FineDance is 152.3 seconds com-
pared to 13.3 seconds for the AIST++ dataset, so we use the
FineDance dataset to train and test the long-term dance gen-
eration algorithm. We test the 20 pieces of music in the test
set of the FineDance dataset and generate dance sequences
with a length of 1024 frames (34.13 seconds).
AIST++ is also a widely used dance dataset, containing
5.2 hours of dance data, with a frame rate of 60 fps, and
includes 10 dance genres.
Implementation details. In the experiments on the
FineDance dataset, the global music feature length Nis
1024, corresponding to 34.13 seconds; the local music fea-
ture length nis 256, corresponding to 8.53 seconds. The
global diffusion output 13 characteristic dance primitives,
where 5 are dhand 8 are ds. After the choreography aug-
ments operation, dsis mirrored to produce 16 instances, and
it is aligned with the music’s beat. The optimizer of global
diffusion and local diffusion are Adan[49], we use the Ex-
ponential Moving Average(EMA) [20] strategy to make the
loss convergence process more stable. The learning rate
is1e−4. In the inference phase, we have two diffusion
sampling strategies DDPM [11] and DDIM [41] that can be
used to generate dance. On the AIST++ dataset, we down-
sampled the dance to 30 fps for training. Then we gener-
ated dances with 30 fps. Finally, we interpolated the output
dances to 60 fps and followed the experimental setup of Bai-
lando [39] for testing. The music-dance data from AIST++
has been segmented into numerous short clips. Therefore,
we change the global music feature length Nto be 256 and
the global music feature length nto be 128.
4.2. Comparisons on the FineDance dataset
As shown in Table 1, we compare our method with the ad-
vanced existing works. FACT [22] and MNET [19] are
auto-gressive dance generation methods. Bailando [39] is
an outstanding music-driven dance generation algorithm. It
employs VQ-V AE to transform dance movements into to-
kens. Subsequently, a GPT model forecasts this token se-
quence, which is then decoded to render the final dance.
To the best of our knowledge, EDGE [46] is a diffusion-
based dance generation algorithm, achieving the strongest
qualitative performance in short-duration dance generation.
During the diffusion denoising process, they assign the lat-
1529
ter half of the previous dance segment to the first half of the
subsequent segment, and utilize interpolation to maintain
consistency, thereby achieving long-term dance generation.
Motion Quality. To evaluate the motion quality of gener-
ated dance sequences, we follow the previous methods[22,
39] to calculate the Frechet Inception Distance ( FID)[10]
distance between motion features of the generated dance
and the ground truth dance sequences. The previous meth-
ods such as [39] calculate kinetic[34] and geometric[32]
motion features using the global coordinates of all the
SMPL[25] joints, which is suitable for measuring the qual-
ity of movements lasting only a few seconds. However, for
longer motion sequences, where trajectories become more
complex, this measurement approach focuses too heavily on
root positions, neglecting local movements and resulting in
data that lacks comparability. Therefore, we use the global
coordinates of the root joint and the relative distances of
other child joints to compute kinetic and geometric features.
The kinematic feature (subscript ‘k’), indicates the speed
and acceleration of the movement and reflects the physi-
cal characteristics of the dance. Therefore the FID distance
between kinematic features FIDkmeasures the physical re-
ality of the motion. The geometric feature (subscript ‘g’),
is calculated based on multiple predefined movement tem-
plates, thus the FID distance between geometric features
FIDgreflects the quality of the overall dance choreogra-
phy. In addition, we follow [18] to report the Foot Skating
Ratio (FSR) , which measures the proportion of frames in
which either foot skids more than a certain distance while
maintaining contact with the ground (foot height <5 cm).
Motion Diversity. To evaluate the motion diversity of gen-
erated dance sequences, we calculate the mean Euclidean
distance within the motion feature space, as outlined in the
works of Bailando[39]. DIV krepresents the motion diver-
sity in the kinematic feature space, while DIV gdenotes the
diversity in the geometric feature space. Table 1 reveals
that our Lodge approach achieved the highest DIV gscore,
which can be credited to our adoption of global diffusion
and characteristic dance primitives for mastering diverse
choreography patterns.
Beat Alignment Score (BAS). To evaluate the beat consis-
tency between the generated dance and the given music, we
follow [22] and use the BAS to evaluate our methods, our
approach demonstrated the highest Beat Alignment Score
of 0.2397.
Production efficiency. In our inference process, we eval-
uated the average Run time taken for model generation.
To ensure fairness in testing, we excluded data prepro-
cessing time from our calculations. All experiments were
conducted on the same computer equipped with an Nvidia
A100 GPU and 256GB of memory.
Run Time in Table 1 presents the average Run Time re-
quired to generate 1024 frames of dance movements. Bai-lando achieved a outstanding performance, but its runtime
increases linearly with the length of the sequence generated.
EDGE, using the ddim accelerated sampling strategy and
linear interpolation, also achieved a fast level for generat-
ing long dance sequences. Our method uses DDPM sam-
pling with a denoising step of 1000, taking 30.93 seconds.
Using DDIM with 100 denoising steps takes only 4.57 sec-
onds. Meanwhile, our parallel architecture ensures runtime
remains stable even with longer sequences.
User study. We conducted a user study where 20 partic-
ipants viewed 17 video pairs. Each pair consists of two
dance sequences: one created by Lodge (DDPM) and the
other by different methods or ground truth.
4.3. Comparisons on the AIST++ dataset
As Table 2 shows, we train Lodge on AIST++ and compare
it with SOTAs. Due to the lack of long-duration dance in
the AIST++ dataset, Lodge’s performance does not reach
the best metrics. However, compared to our baseline model
EDGE, Lodge shows improvement in multiple metrics.
4.4. Ablation Studies
In this section, we use DDPM sampling strategy and per-
form ablation experiments on the FineDance dataset to eval-
uate the different parts: (1) the characteristic dance primi-
tives, (2)the soft cue guidance, (3) the foot refine block.
Effect of the characteristic dance primitives. We con-
ducted a series of ablation experiments to validate the effect
of the characteristic dance primitives. In Table 3, ‘C’ in-
dicates we use characteristic dance primitives to guide the
local diffusion, ‘M’ represents we mirror the characteristic
dance primitives. ‘B’ denotes beat alignment, we align the
characterized dance primitives with the music’s beats, guid-
ing the Local diffusion to generate more expressive move-
ments at these beat points. If beat alignment is not applied,
then the characterized dance primitives are uniformly dis-
tributed across various timelines to guide the local diffusion.
The first row in Table 3 shows the results when not using
characteristic dance primitives, relying solely on some dh
for parallel long action generation but not using dswithin a
Local diffusion. This scenario leads to lower quality of mo-
tion (FID), diversity, and music rhythm alignment metrics.
In contrast, rows two and three, which incorporate guid-
ance from characteristic dance primitives, display signifi-
cant improvements in Div and BAS. This improvement is
because characteristic dance primitives are expressive key
motions; their inclusion helps prevent the neural network
from generating average, monotonous movements. The last
row, achieving the optimal results, demonstrates the effec-
tiveness of our strategy.
Effect of the Soft-cue Guidance. Our soft cue guidance
weight can be adjusted using the hyperparameter ‘s’, where
a larger ‘s’ value signifies a stronger effect. Table 4 demon-

5. Conclusion and Limitation
In this work, we introduce Lodge, a two-stage coarse-to-fine
diffusion network, and propose characteristic dance primi-
tives as intermediate-level representations for the two diffu-
sion models. Lodge has been extensively evaluated through
user studies and standard metrics. Our generated samples
demonstrate that Lodge can parallelly generate dances that
conform to choreographic rules while preserving local de-
tails and physical realism. However, our method currently
cannot generate dance movements with hand gestures or fa-
cial expressions, which are also crucial for performances.
This limitation opens avenues for future research.
