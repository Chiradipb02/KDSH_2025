Abstract
While super-resolution (SR) methods based on diffusion
models exhibit promising results, their practical application
is hindered by the substantial number of required inference
steps. Recent methods utilize the degraded images in the
initial state, thereby shortening the Markov chain. Never-
theless, these solutions either rely on a precise formulation
of the degradation process or still necessitate a relatively
lengthy generation path (e.g., 15 iterations). To enhance in-
ference speed, we propose a simple yet effective method for
achieving single-step SR generation, named SinSR . Specifi-
cally, we first derive a deterministic sampling process from
the most recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for acceler-
ating diffusion-based SR. This allows the mapping between
the input random noise and the generated high-resolution
image to be obtained in a reduced and acceptable number
of inference steps during training. We show that this de-
terministic mapping can be distilled into a student model
that performs SR within only one inference step. Addition-
ally, we propose a novel consistency-preserving loss to si-
multaneously leverage the ground-truth image during the
distillation process, ensuring that the performance of the
student model is not solely bound by the feature manifold of
the teacher model, resulting in further performance improve-
ment. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve comparable or even superior performance com-
pared to both previous SOTA methods and the teacher model,
in just one sampling step, resulting in a remarkable up to
√ó10speedup for inference. Our code will be released at

1. Introduction
Image super-resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct a high-
resolution image from a given low-resolution (LR) coun-
terpart [ 45]. Recently, diffusion models, known for their
effectiveness in modeling complex distributions, have gained

widespread adoption and demonstrated remarkable perfor-
mance in SR tasks, particularly in terms of perceptual quality.
Specifically, current strategies for employing diffusion
models can be broadly categorized into two streams: con-
catenating the LR image to the input of the denoiser in the
diffusion models [ 32,33], and adjusting the inverse process
of a pre-trained diffusion model [ 4,5,14]. Despite achieving
promising results, both strategies encounter computational
efficiency issues. Notably, the initial state of these condi-
tional diffusion models is a pure Gaussian noise without us-
ing the prior knowledge from the LR image. Consequently, a
substantial number of inference steps are required to achieve
satisfactory performance, significantly hindering the practi-
cal applications of diffusion-based SR techniques.
Efforts have been made to enhance the sampling effi-
ciency of diffusion models, leading to various techniques
proposed [ 22,28,37]. However, in the realm of low-level
vision where maintaining high fidelity is critical, these tech-
niques often fall short as they achieve acceleration at the
cost of performance. More recently, innovative techniques
have emerged to reformulate the diffusion process in image
restoration tasks, focusing on improving the signal-to-noise
ratio of the initial diffusion state and thereby shorten the

Markov chain. For instance, [ 43] initiates the denoising dif-
fusion process with the input noisy image, while in the SR
task, [ 46] models the initial step as a combination of the
LR image and random noise. Nonetheless, even in these
most recent works [ 43,46], limitations persist. For instance,
while [ 43] shows promising results within just three infer-
ence steps, it requires a clear formulation of the image degra-
dation process. Besides, [ 46] still necessitates 15inference
steps and exhibits degraded performance with noticeable
artifacts if the number of inference steps is further reduced.
To address these challenges, we introduce a novel ap-
proach that can generate high-resolution (HR) images in
only one sampling step, without compromising the diversity
and perceptual quality of the diffusion model, as shown in
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Specifically, we propose to directly learn
a well-paired bi-directional deterministic mapping between
the input random noise and the generated HR image from a
teacher diffusion model. To accelerate the generation of well-
matched training data, we first derive a deterministic sam-
pling strategy from the most recent state-of-the-art work [ 46],
designed for accelerating diffusion-based SR, from its origi-
nal stochastic formulation. Additionally, we propose a novel
consistency-preserving loss to leverage ground-truth images,
further enhancing the perceptual quality of the generated HR
images by minimizing the error between ground-truth (GT)
images and those generated from the predicted initial state.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
comparable or even better performance compared to SOTA
methods and the teacher diffusion model [ 46], while greatly
reducing the number of inference steps from 15to1, result-
ing in up to a √ó10speedup in inference.
Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
‚Ä¢We accelerate the diffusion-based SR model to a single
inference step with comparable or even superior perfor-
mance for the first time. Instead of shortening the Markov
chain of the generation process, we propose a simple yeteffective approach that directly distills a deterministic gen-
eration function into a student network.
‚Ä¢To further fasten training, we derive a deterministic sam-
pling strategy from the recent SOTA method [ 46] on ac-
celerating the SR task, enabling efficient generation of
well-matched training pairs.
‚Ä¢We propose a novel consistency-preserving loss that can
utilize the ground-truth images during training, preventing
the student model from only focusing on fitting the deter-
ministic mapping of the teacher diffusion model, therefore
leading to better performance.
‚Ä¢Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our proposed method can achieve com-
parable or even superior performance compared to SOTA
methods and the teacher diffusion model, while greatly
reducing the number of inference steps from 15to1.
2. Related Work
2.1. Image Super-Resolution
With the rise of deep learning, deep learning-based tech-
niques gradually become the mainstream of the SR task [ 8,
45]. One prevalent approach of early works is to train a
regression model using paired training data [ 1,2,16,44].
While the expectation of the posterior distribution can be
well modeled, they inevitably suffer from the over-smooth
problem [ 17,27,34]. To improve the perceptual quality
of the generated HR images, generative-based SR mod-
els attract increasing attention, e.g., autoregressive-based
models [ 6,26,29,30]. While significant improvements are
achieved, the computational cost of autoregressive models is
usually large. Subsequently, normalizing flows [ 23,42] are
demonstrated to have good perceptual quality under an effi-
cient inference process, while its network design is restricted
by the requirements of the invertibility and ease of calcula-
tion. Besides, GAN-based methods also achieve great suc-
cess in terms of perceptual quality [ 9,13,17,27,34]. How-
ever, the training of GAN-based methods is usually unstable.
Recently, diffusion-based models have been widely investi-
gated in SR [ 4,5,14,32,33]. The diffusion-based SR meth-
ods can be roughly summarized into two categories, concate-
nating the LR image to the input of the denoiser [ 32,33], and
modifying the backward process of a pre-trained diffusion
model [ 4,5,10,14]. While promising results are achieved,
they rely on a large number of inference steps, which greatly
hinders the application of diffusion-based models.
2.2. Acceleration of Diffusion Models
Recently, the acceleration of diffusion models has attracted
more and more attention. Several algorithms are proposed
for general diffusion models [ 22,28,37,38] and proved
quite effective for image generations. One intuitive strat-
egy among them is to distill the diffusion models to a stu-
dent model. However, the huge training overhead to solve

Figure 3. A comparison between the vanilla diffusion-based SR
method [ 33], a most recent method for acceleration of the diffusion-
based SR [ 46], and the proposed one-step SR. Different from recent
works that shorten the Markov chain to speed up the inference pro-
cess [ 43,46], the proposed method directly learns the deterministic
generation process and the details can be found in Fig. 4.
the ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the inference
process makes this scheme less attractive on a large-scale
dataset [ 24]. To alleviate the training overhead, progressive
distillation strategies are usually adopted [ 25,35]. Mean-
while, instead of simply simulating the behavior of a teacher
diffusion model through distillation, better inference paths
are explored in an iterative manner [ 20,21]. While progres-
sive distillation effectively decreases the training overhead,
the error accumulates at the same time, leading to an ob-
vious performance loss in SR. Most recently, targeting the
image restoration task, some works reformulate the diffusion
process by either using the knowledge of degradation pro-
cess [ 43] or a pre-defined distribution of the initial state [ 46],
yielding a shortened Markov chain of the generation process
and better performance than directly applying DDIM [ 37]
in low-level tasks. However, they either require a clear for-
mulation of the degradation or still require a relatively large
number of inference steps.
3. Motivation
Preliminary. Given an LR image yand its correspond-
ing HR image x0, existing diffusion-based SR methods
aim to model the conditional distribution q(x0|y)through
a Markov chain where a forward process is usually definedasq(xt|xt‚àí1) =N(xt;‚àö1‚àíŒ≤txt‚àí1, Œ≤tI)with an initial
statexT‚àº N(0, I). The role of the diffusion model can be
regarded as transferring the input domain (standard Gaussian
noise) to the HR image domain conditioned on the LR im-
age. Since the matching relationship between xTandx0is
unknown, usually a diffusion model [ 11,21,33] through an
iterative manner is required to learn/infer from an unknown
mapping between xTandx0. Our method is grounded in
the idea that having an SR model that effectively captures
the conditional distribution q(x0|y)and establishes a deter-
ministic mapping between xTandÀÜx0given an LR image
y, we can streamline the inference process to a single step
by employing another network, denoted as fÀÜŒ∏, to learn the
correspondence between ÀÜx0andxT, as illustrated in Fig. 3.
Distillation for diffusion SR models: less is more. While
the concept of distilling the mapping between xTandÀÜx0
to a student network has been previously explored [ 21], its
application to SR introduces several challenges:
‚Ä¢The training overhead becomes substantial for one-step
distillation due to a large number of inference steps of
previous models, e.g., LDM [ 32] still need 100steps after
using DDIM [ 37] for inference to generate high-quality
pairs (ÀÜx0, xT, y)as the training data of the student model.
‚Ä¢The performance degradation is attributed to the introduc-
tion of a more intricate distillation strategy involving itera-
tion. For example, to reduce the training overhead, an iter-
ative distillation strategy [ 35] is adopted which gradually
decreases the number of inference steps during training.
However, despite achieving satisfactory results in genera-
tion tasks, the cumulative error significantly impacts the
fidelity of the SR results, as SR tasks are relatively more
sensitive to image quality.
To address the aforementioned two challenges, we pro-
pose to distill the diffusion SR process into a single step in a
simple but effective way based on the following observations.
More details of the observations can be seen in Sec. 5.3
‚Ä¢We demonstrate that the most recent SOTA method for
accelerating the diffusion-based SR [ 46], which achieves
comparable performance in 15steps as LDM [ 32] in100
DDIM steps, has a deterministic mapping between xTand
x0. Besides, the greatly reduced number of inference steps
and the existence of the deterministic mapping make the
training of a single-step distillation possible as shown in
Fig. 6 and Table 4.
‚Ä¢Learning the mapping between xTandÀÜx0is found to be
easier than denoising xtunder different noise levels as
shown in Table 5. Therefore, it is feasible to directly learn
the mapping between xTandÀÜx0so that the accumulated
error by the iterative distillation can be avoided.
‚Ä¢Due to the accumulated error, a more sophisticated distil-
lation strategy (iterative-based) does not contribute to the
improvement in our setting as shown in Table 6.

Figure 4. The overall framework of the proposed method. By minimizing Ldistill andLinverse , the student network fÀÜŒ∏learns the
deterministic bi-directional mapping between xTandÀÜx0obtained from a pre-trained teacher diffusion model in one step. Meanwhile,
the proposed consistency preserving loss Lgtis optimized during training to utilize the information from the GT images to pursue better
perceptual quality instead of simply fitting the deterministic mappings from the teacher model. Specifically, the GT image is first converted
to its latent code ÀÜxT=fÀÜŒ∏(x0, y,0), and then converted back to calculate its reconstruction loss LMSE(fÀÜŒ∏(ÀÜxT, y, T), x0).
we first demonstrate that ResShift [ 46], in which the infer-
ence process is originally stochastic, can be converted to a
deterministic model without retraining in Sec 4.1, and then
the proposed consistency preserving distillation in Sec 4.2.
4. Methodology
4.1. Deterministic Sampling
A core difference between ResShift [ 46] and LDM [ 32]
is the formulation of the initial state xT. Specifically, in
ResShift [ 46], the information from the LR image yis inte-
grated into the diffusion step xtas follows
q(xt|x0, y) =N(xt;x0+Œ∑t(y‚àíx0), Œ∫2Œ∑tI),(1)
where Œ∑tis a serial of hyper-parameters that monotonically
increases with the timestep tand obeys Œ∑T‚Üí1andŒ∑0‚Üí0.
As such, the inverse of the diffusion process starts from an
initial state with rich information from the LR image yas
follows xT=y+Œ∫‚àöŒ∑Tœµwhere œµ‚àº N(0,I). To generate
a HR image xfrom a given image y, the original inverse
process of [46] is as follows
pŒ∏(xt‚àí1|xt, y) =N(xt‚àí1|¬µŒ∏(xt, y, t), Œ∫2Œ∑t‚àí1
Œ∑tŒ±tI),(2)
where ¬µŒ∏(xt, y, t)is reparameterized by a deep network. As
shown in Eq. 2, given an initial state xT=y+Œ∫‚àöŒ∑Tœµ,
the generated image is stochastic due to the existence of
the random noise during the sampling from pŒ∏(xt‚àí1|xt, y).
Inspired by DDIM sampling [ 37], we find that a non-
Markovian reverse process q(xt‚àí1|xt, x0, y)exists which
keeps the marginal distribution q(xt|x0, y)unchanged so
For ease of presentation, the LR image is yis pre-upsampled to the same
spatial resolution with the HR image x. Besides, similar to [ 32,46], the
diffusion is conducted in the latent space.that it can be directly adopted to a pre-trained model. The
reformulated deterministic reverse process is as follows
q(xt‚àí1|xt, x0, y) =Œ¥(ktx0+mtxt+jty), (3)
where Œ¥is the unit impulse, and kt, mt, jtare as follows

kt= 1‚àíŒ∑t‚àí1+‚àöŒ∑t‚àí1Œ∑t‚àíq
Œ∑t‚àí1
Œ∑t.(4)
The details of the derivation can be found in the supplemen-
tary material. As a consequence, for inference, the reverse
process conditioned on yis reformulated as follows
xt‚àí1=ktÀÜx0+mtxt+jty
=ktfŒ∏(xt, y, t) +mtxt+jty,(5)
where fŒ∏(xt, y, t)is the predicted HR image from a pre-
trained ResShift [ 46] model. By sampling from the reformu-
lated process in Eq. 5, a deterministic mapping between xT
(orœµ) and ÀÜx0can be obtained and is denoted as FŒ∏(xT, y).
4.2. Consistency Preserving Distillation
Vanilla distillation. We propose utilizing a student network
fÀÜŒ∏to learn the deterministic mapping FŒ∏between the random
initialized state xTand its deterministic output FŒ∏(xT, y)
from a teacher diffusion model. The vanilla distillation loss
is defined as follows
Ldistill =LMSE(fÀÜŒ∏(xT, y, T ), FŒ∏(xT, y)), (6)
where fÀÜŒ∏(xT, y, T )is the student network that directly pre-
dicts the HR image in only one step, and FŒ∏represents the
proposed deterministic inference process of ResShift [ 46]
in Sec. 4.1 through an iterative manner using a pre-trained
25799
network parameterized by Œ∏. We observe that the student
model trained solely with the distillation loss in Eq. 6 al-
ready achieves promising results in just one inference step,
as indicated by ‚Äú(distill only)‚Äù in the result tables.
Regularization by the ground-truth image. A limitation
of the aforementioned vanilla distillation strategy is that the
GT image is not utilized during training, thereby restricting
the upper performance bound of the student model. To
further enhance the student‚Äôs performance, we propose a
novel strategy that incorporates a learned inversion of the HR
image to provide additional regularization from the ground-
truth images. In addition to the vanilla distillation loss, the
student network concurrently learns the inverse mapping
during training by minimizing the following loss,
Linverse =LMSE(fÀÜŒ∏(FŒ∏(xT, y), y,0), xT), (7)
where the last parameter of fÀÜŒ∏is set from Tin Eq. 6 to 0,
indicating that the model is predicting the inversion instead
of the ÀÜx0. Then the GT image x0can be employed to regu-
larize the output SR image given its predicted inversion ÀÜxT
as follows
ÀÜxT=detach (fÀÜŒ∏(x0, y,0))
Lgt=LMSE(fÀÜŒ∏(ÀÜxT, y, T ), x0),(8)
where Lgtis the proposed consistency preserving loss. By
reusing fÀÜŒ∏to learn both fÀÜŒ∏(¬∑,¬∑, T)andfÀÜŒ∏(¬∑,¬∑,0)simultane-
ously, we can initialize the parameter ÀÜŒ∏of the student model
from the teacher one Œ∏to speed up the training.
The overall training objective. The student network is
trained to minimize the aforementioned three losses at the
same time as follows
ÀÜŒ∏= arg min
ÀÜŒ∏Ey,x0,xT[Ldistill +Lreverse +Lgt],(9)
where the losses are defined in Eq. 6, 7, and 8 respectively.
We assign equal weight to each loss term, and ablation stud-
ies are in the supplementary material. The overall of the
proposed method is summarized in Algorithm 1 and Fig. 4.

5.1. Experimental setup
Training Details. For a fair comparison, we follow the
same experimental setup and backbone design as that in [ 46].
Specifically, the main difference is that we finetuned the
model for 30K iterations instead of training from scratch for
500K in [ 46]. We find that the student model can converge
quickly so that even if for each iteration we need extra time
to solve the ODE to get paired training data, the overall
training time is still much shorter than retraining a model
from scratch following [ 46]. We train the models on the
training set of ImageNet [ 7] following the same pipelineAlgorithm 1 Training

Compared methods. We compare our method with sev-
eral representative SR models, including RealSR-JPEG [ 12],
ESRGAN [ 40], BSRGAN [ 47], SwinIR [ 18], RealESR-
GAN [ 41], DASR [ 19], LDM [ 32], and ResShift [ 46].
For a comprehensive comparison, we further evaluate the
performance of diffusion-based models LDM [ 32] and
ResShift [ 46] with a reduced number of sampling steps.
Besides, we compare the proposed method with Rectified-
Flow [ 21], a SOTA method that can compress the generation
process into a single step, in Table 6.
Metrics. For the evaluation of the proposed method on the
synthetic testing dataset with reference images, we utilize
PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS [ 48] to measure the fidelity per-
formance. Besides, two recent SOTA non-reference metrics
are used to justify the realism of all the images, i.e., CLIP-
IQA [ 39] which leverages a CLIP model [ 31] pre-trained on
a large-scale dataset (Laion400M [36]) and MUSIQ [15].

Evaluation on real-world datasets. RealSR [ 3] and Re-

of the model on unseen real-world data. Specifically, in Re-
alSR [ 3], there are 100 real images captured by two different
cameras in different scenarios. Besides, RealSet65 [ 46] in-
cludes 65 LR images in total, collected from widely used
datasets and the internet. The results on these two datasets

3000 high-resolution images are first randomly selected from
the validation set of ImageNet [ 7]. The corresponding LR
images are obtained by using the provided script in [ 46]. As
shown in Table 2, while reducing the inference step from
15to only 1slightly decreases PSNR and SSIM, the pro-
posed method achieves the best perceptual quality measured
by LPIPS, a more recent full-reference image quality as-
sessment (IQA) metric than SSIM. Besides, the proposed
method also achieves the best performance among all the
methods measured on the most recent SOTA metric CLIP-
IQA [ 39], demonstrating that the proposed 1-step model is
on par with or even slightly better than the teacher model
with 15 inference steps in terms of perceptual qualities.
Evaluation of the efficiency. We assess the computational
efficiency of the proposed method in comparison to SOTA ap-
proaches. As shown in Table 3, the proposed method demon-
strates superior performance with only one inference step,
outperforming ResShift [ 46]‚Äîthe adopted teacher model,
which had already significantly reduced the inference time
compared to LDM [ 32]. It is worth noting that all methods
presented in Table 3 run in latent space, and the computa-
tional cost of VQ-V AE is counted.
5.3. Analysis
How important is the deterministic sampling? We eval-
uate the performance of the model trained on generated
paired samples from the proposed deterministic sampling
and the default stochastic sampling strategy (xT,ÀÜFŒ∏(xT, y))
in [46]. Due to the randomness of the generated samples
x‚àºÀÜFŒ∏(xT, y), given a random noise œµ, the prediction is an
expectation of its conditional distribution. The comparison
in Fig. 6 further verifies that the results trained w/o determin-Methods CLIPIQA ‚ÜëMUSIQ ‚Üë

istic teacher model exhibit blurred details. Besides, as shown
in Table 4, there is a significant performance degradation
when we replace the proposed deterministic sampling with
the default one in [ 46], demonstrating the effectiveness and
necessity of involving the proposed deterministic sampling.
Why does a single-step distillation work? Previous studies
suggest that directly learning the mapping between xTand
x0is typically challenging due to the non-causal properties
of the generation process [ 20]. However, our empirical find-

deterministic mapping is relatively easier to learn.

ings indicate that the matching between xTandx0in the
SR task is relatively easier to learn than denoising under dif-
ferent noise levels, as diffusion models do. Specifically, the
capacity of the student network fÀÜŒ∏is sufficient to effectively
capture the ODE process FŒ∏using only one step. To ver-
ify our assumption, we evaluate the performance of smaller
models trained under different strategies. Specifically, one
model is trained following the experimental settings of [ 46]
while the number of parameters decreases from 118.6M
to24.3M. Another model uses the same backbone as the
aforementioned small model while directly learning the map-
ping relationship between xTandÀÜx0from the standard-size
teacher diffusion model. A comparison between these two
small models is reported in Table 5. As demonstrated by the
results, the model trained for denoising under different noise
levels suffers from a serious performance drop compared
with the model that directly learns the deterministic mapping
between. This strongly supports our assumption that directly
learning the deterministic mapping is relatively easier.
Is a more sophisticated distillation strategy necessary?
To explore the necessity of more advanced techniques that
learn the mapping between xTandx0, we evaluate the per-
formance of Rectified Flow [ 21], a recent method that learns
the mapping to a single step through an iterative manner.
Specifically, Reflow operations are conducted to avoid cross-
ing the generation paths, and then followed by distilling the
rectified generation process into a single step. However, as
shown in Table 6, the involved iterative distillation degrades
the performance of the final model due to the accumulated
error as discussed by the author [ 21]. Besides, as verified by
the previous section that the deterministic mapping between
xTandx0is easy to learn in the SR task, the benefit of a
more sophisticated distillation strategy is not obvious.
Learned inversion. As the core of the consistency pre-
serving loss, a comparison with the DDIM inversion [ 37] is

shown in Fig. 7, where the proposed method achieves better
fidelity performance. It indicates that the proposed method
can obtain a more accurate estimation of xT. Besides, more
analyses regarding the consistency preserving loss are in the
supplementary material.
Training overhead. While the proposed method involves
solving ODEs during training, benefiting from a shortened
inference process and initializing the student model from
the pre-trained teacher model, the training cost of finetuning
using the proposed training paradigm is still lower than that
of retraining the diffusion model from scratch. Specifically,
the training cost is shown in Table 7.

6. Conclusion
In this work, we propose a novel strategy to accelerate
the diffusion-based SR models into a single inference step.
Specifically, a one-step bi-directional distillation is proposed
to learn the deterministic mapping between the input noise
and the generated high-resolution image and versa vice from
a teacher diffusion model with our derived deterministic
sampling. Meanwhile, a novel consistency preserving loss
is optimized at the same time during the distillation so that
the student model not only uses the information from the
pre-trained teacher diffusion model but also directly learns
from ground-truth images. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method can achieve on-par or even better
performance than the teacher model in only one step.
