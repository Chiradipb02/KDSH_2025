Abstract
The Equity, Diversity & Inclusion event is a special day organized
in conjunction with KDD ‚Äô24, the 30ùë°‚ÑéACM SIGKDD Conference
on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, which will take place
from Sunday, August 25 to Thursday, August 29, 2024 at the Center
de Convencions Internacional de Barcelona in Barcelona, Spain.
This special day, scheduled for August 28, 2024, promotes equity,
diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in data science, artificial intelligence,
and beyond. It will bring together academics, researchers, practi-
tioners, and human resources professionals (i) to present algorithms,
techniques, methodologies, and projects in data science that enable
responsible data processing and modeling; (ii) to discuss policies,
best practices, and guidelines to promote an inclusive work envi-
ronment and effective collaboration; (iii) to share personal stories
to encourage young researchers, including those from groups un-
represented in the research community, to develop strong careers
in data science; and (iv) to collaboratively develop and discuss an
EDI Manifesto to promote an inclusive workplace environment and
guiding principles in the development of research activities.

1 Overview
The organizers of KDD 2024 are committed to the principles of
equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) and ensuring that the commu-
nity is open to the diverse needs of its members. Everyone deserves

ual characteristics. These basic principles must be ensured in the
working environment and as driving guidelines in the design and
development of research activities. As academics, researchers, and
practitioners in knowledge discovery and data mining, we must
adhere to the principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion in the
complete pipeline of the knowledge discovery process. Specifically,
we must ensure data representativeness, prevent misuse of pro-
tected data, carry out responsible data processing, and support
unbiased decision-making to avoid discrimination. In addition, our
society is constantly changing. Research efforts should be directed
toward designing and developing new, more equitable approaches
to mitigate the problem of underrepresentation and, in some cases,
the complete absence of certain groups in data collection, which can
lead to various forms of discrimination and bias in the deployment
phase of data-driven approaches.
The EDI event will focus on research, innovation, and policies
to promote EDI principles in the rapidly evolving fields of data sci-
ence, artificial intelligence, and beyond. This special day, scheduled
for August 28, 2024, will bring together researchers, practitioners,
and human resource professionals to share and discuss how EDI
principles can be explored as optimized approaches and drivers in
our daily work to promote a cultural shift for a more inclusive work
environment and unbiased data-driven practices. This initiative
is also relevant to government, the private and public sectors, ac-
tivism, and the media. Key goals include eliminating discrimination
and prejudice, eliminating stereotypes, and promoting well-being.
These goals serve as research challenges and workplace policies to
build a more reflective and inclusive society.
The event features four sessions:
Session I - "Keynote Speakers" presents a range of selected individ-
uals from the KDD research community and beyond who discuss
research projects using an intersectional approach to examine the
inequalities that arise at the intersection of different social factors
under particular systems and structures of power. Understanding
the inequalities hidden in data science and artificial intelligence
methods facilitates the development of new methods that promote
inclusive and responsible data science practices. The latter methods
enable fair data processing and modeling, ensure data representa-
tiveness, and incorporate privacy-preserving techniques. Partici-
pants will learn how to integrate fair and unbiased data strategies
into their research activities and will discover how EDI principles
can be easily integrated into data science and machine learning
projects.

Session II - "EDI policies and best practices". A human resource pro-
fessional, an expert in EDI policies and strategies, will help discuss
policies, best practices, and guidelines to promote an inclusive work
environment and effective collaboration. Participants will learn EDI
strategies they can explore daily and discover the corresponding
benefits.
Section III - "Empowering individuals to do their best". This ses-
sion provides a space for sharing personal stories of successful
individuals who represent the different nuances of our society.
These narratives are particularly valuable in encouraging young
researchers, including those from underrepresented groups in the
research community, to pursue and develop strong careers in data
science. First-hand experiences can inspire and motivate young
researchers to show that success is achievable for everyone.
Section IV - "Collaborative design of an EDI Manifesto". Partici-
pants will engage in dialogues and working groups to define an
EDI manifesto collaboratively. It will include a set of principles and
guidelines that will serve as a roadmap for inclusive research activ-
ities and workplace cultures. The EDI Manifesto will help establish
and reinforce standards and principles to guarantee that equity,
diversity, and inclusion are mainstreaming in developing research
activity and the professional environment.

foster the development of more equitable and inclusive research
in data science and more open, reflective, and inclusive research
communities.
