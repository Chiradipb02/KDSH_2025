ABSTRACT
With the expansion and growth of cities, profiling urban areas with
the advent of multi-modal urban datasets (e.g., points-of-interest
and street view imagery) has become increasingly important in ur-
ban planing and management. Particularly, street view images have
gained popularity for understanding the characteristics of urban ar-
eas due to its abundant visual information and inherent correlations
with human activities. In this study, we define a street segment rep-
resented by multiple street view images as the minimum spatial unit
for analysis and predict its functional and socioeconomic indicators,
which presents several challenges in modeling spatial distributions
of images on a street and the spatial topology (adjacency) of streets.
Meanwhile, Large Language Models are capable of understanding
imagery data based on its extraordinary knowledge base and unveil
a remarkable opportunity for profiling streets with images. In view
of the challenges and opportunity, we present a semi-supervised
Urban Street Profiling Model (USPM) based on street view imagery
and spatial adjacency of urban streets. Specifically, given a street
with multiple images, we first employ a newly designed spatial
context-based contrastive learning method to generate feature vec-
tors of images and then apply the LSTM-based fusion method to
encode multiple images on a street to yield the street visual repre-
sentation; we then create the descriptions of street scenes for street
view images based on the SPHINX (a large language model) and
produce the street textual representation; finally, we build an urban
street graph based on spatial topology (adjacency) and employ a
semi-supervised graph learning algorithm to further encode the

1 INTRODUCTION
Profiling urban areas is crucial for urban planning and manage-
ment, such as in the analysis of economic development, population
dynamics, and air quality [ 2,12,31,42]. Among the various spatial
elements in our cities, urban streets are the veins connecting a
variety of locations, and a major carrier of socioeconomic activities.
They not only provide spatial and functional convenience but also
serve as the proper spatial units for the high-resolution analysis of
urban socioeconomic indicators [ 21]. Traditionally, urban profiling
is managed by authorities through extracting information from
multiple urban datasets, as well as conducting field or airborne
surveys. Such traditional methods are largely labor-intensive and
time-consuming, and may even be financially unfeasible for some
local authorities.
Thanks to physical and social sensing networks, a wealth of
urban datasets (e.g., POI data, human mobility data, and street view
imagery) are generated, leading to significant changes in the study
of urban profiling [ 14,23,24,35,36,39]. Among these urban data,
319

street view images, which offer high-resolution views of urban areas
from a human perspective, have gained popularity due to their detail
and frequency of updates. Using street view images to profile urban
streets offers three main advantages. Firstly, street view images
can support comprehensive measurements as they cover almost
the entire area of a city. Secondly, street view image data is widely
available on both commercial and crowd-sourced platforms (e.g.
Google Maps, Tencent Maps, and Mapillary), enabling accurate and
timely reflection of urban changes. Lastly, street view images can
provide socioeconomic information, furthering our understanding
of human-space interactions due to their inherent connections to
human perception and the socioeconomic aspects of cities.
In this study, we choose the street with multiple street view
images as the minimum spatial unit and aim to predict its functional
and socioeconomic indicators (i.e., urban street profiling), which
presents the following challenges.
•There are numerous street view images on a street, showing
diverse spatial distributions. Existing methods primarily con-
centrate on learning the visual representation of an image by
creating contrastive samples based on augmented images or
additional information (e.g., POIs) [ 21,33,34], overlooking
the spatial correlation between a street and the images on
the street. Consequently, modeling the spatial distribution
of street view images on a street to produce the street visual
representation continues to be a challenge.
•According to the First Law of Geography [ 30], nearby streets
typically share similar functional and socioeconomic indica-
tors. Moreover, only a small number of streets are labeled
due to the time and effort required for labeling. Therefore,
addressing the urban street profiling task for label scarcity
and modeling the spatial adjacency of streets present another
challenge.
Meanwhile, the recent prosperity of Large Language Models
(LLMs) unveils a remarkable opportunity for profiling streets with
images – LLMs have been trained with Internet-scale of multi-modal
data, including enormous amount of images and corresponding tex-
tual descriptions. In this way, LLMs have acquired an extraordinary
knowledge base that makes them highly capable of understand-
ing imagery data, and transforming images to textual descriptions
through prompting. This sheds light on our application, i.e., we
can leverage LLMs to generate highly relevant text descriptions
tailored to our applications like function inference, as embodiment
of the LLM’s knowledge base, to enrich the information that can
be utilized for representing urban streets.
In view of the aforementioned challenges and opportunity, we
propose a semi-supervised Urban Street Profiling Model (USPM)
based on street view imagery and spatial topology (adjacency) of
urban streets. USPM mainly consists of two components: street rep-
resentation learning and urban street profiling. Given a street with
multiple street view images, we propose a spatial context-based
contrastive learning method to generate feature embeddings for
each image. Subsequently, we use an LSTM-based fusion method
to encode these images, producing a comprehensive visual repre-
sentation for the street. Further, we create the descriptions of street
scenes via image captioning based on the SPHINX-V2 [ 25] and
utilize a pre-trained Bert [ 4] to produce the textual representationfor the street. Finally, we combine the visual and textual represen-
tations of a street using an attention method to generate the street
representation. In the component of urban street profiling, we first
construct an urban street network based on the spatial adjacency
of streets, with streets serving as nodes and street representations
serving as node features. Then we employ a semi-supervised graph
learning algorithm to capture the spatial relationships of streets for
prediction.
To summarize, our contributions are as follows:
•We present a semi-supervised Urban Street Profiling Method
that mainly models the street view images and spatial adja-
cency of streets, using limited labels of streets. Powered by
LLMs, we create scene captions for street view images and
incorporate textual knowledge into street representations.
We show that the textual modality is a valuable supplement
for understanding urban streets, enabling the city to be not
only watched but also read.
•We propose a spatial context-based contrastive learning
method to yield the visual representations of street view
images, which considers the spatial relationships between
streets and images to generate contrastive samples. Addi-
tionally, we model the spatial distribution of street view
images on a street using a LSTM network to yield the street
representation.
•We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed
USPM with real-world datasets. Experimental results show
that the significant performance improvements are achieved
compared to various baseline methods. Data and source
codes are available at: https://github.com/lizc-sdu/USPM.
2 PROBLEM FORMULATION
We formulate the urban street profiling problem with the following
definitions.
Definition 1 (Urban Street). We adopt the OpenStreetMap
data to extract the urban streets, represented as S={𝑠1,𝑠2,···,𝑠𝑛},
where𝑠𝑖denotes the𝑖th street segment within the study city and 𝑛is
the total number of streets.
Definition 2 (Street View Image). Street view images are cap-
tured alongside the road network in urban areas, providing a high-
resolution of urban city from a human perspective.
These images are typically captured by specialized vehicles at
specific sampling points from four different directions, in order to
obtain a comprehensive coverage. In our research, we associate
each street inSwith a set of street view images, captured from
various sampling points along the street. For a given street 𝑠𝑖∈S,
its corresponding images are denoted as SV𝑖={𝑆𝑉𝑖,1,𝑆𝑉𝑖,2,···}.
It is important to note that the number of images for each street
(|SV| ) is different.
Definition 3 (Street Indicators). Based on surveys and ur-
ban datasets from multiple sources, certain streets are labeled with
functional and socioeconomic indicators (e.g., urban function labels,
population, and resident consumption).

area, utilizing limited pre-labeled streets.
3 METHOD
3.1 Overview
We present an overview of our proposed framework in Figure 1,
which is comprised of two primary steps: the street representation
learning process and the urban street profiling process.
Step 1: Given a street containing multiple street view images, we
first employ a newly designed spatial context-based image encoder
to produce the feature embedding for each image and utilize the
LSTM-based fusion method to generate the visual representation
for the street. Further, we construct the street scene descriptions via
street view image captioning and employ a pre-trained text encoder
to generate the textual representation for the street. We finally fuse
the visual and textual representations through an attention method
to yield the street representation.
Step 2: We initially construct a network based on the spatial
adjacency of urban streets, with each street serving as a node. The
adjacent relationship between streets is established using K-nearest
neighbors. The street representation serves as the node feature and
the limited number of streets with labels serve as the labeled nodes.
We then employ the graph learning method to predict urban street
indicators. During the training stage, we optimize the model using
cross-entropy loss with the limited labeled streets, and during the
testing stage, we predict the indicators for the unlabeled streets.
3.2 Street Visual Representation Learning
3.2.1 Spatial Context-based Contrastive Learning. To capture the
spatial correlation among street view images, we propose the spatial
context-based contrastive learning method to learn the representa-
tions of street view images (cf. Figure 2). Different from traditional
methods that minimize the feature distance between two urban
images that are geographically adjacent, we directly maximize the
similarity between a street view image and its spatial context, i.e.,
the street it belongs to. This particular choice is motivated by the

expectation that street view images sampled at the same street
exhibit stronger correlations.
Our proposed method allows various choices of network archi-
tectures for visual encoder design. For simplicity, we adopt the
commonly used ResNet [ 13] to obtain initial visual representations
of street view images. Formally, for street 𝑠𝑖∈Swith street view
imagesSV𝑖={𝑆𝑉𝑖,1,𝑆𝑉𝑖,2,···} , the visual representation for 𝑆𝑉𝑖,𝑗
can be calculated as follows,
h𝑖,𝑗=Resnet(𝑆𝑉𝑖,𝑗). (1)
Its spatial context (i.e., the representation of a street) is calculated
as the average of all the images on the street,
c𝑖=1
|SV𝑖||SV 𝑖|∑︁
𝑗=1h𝑖,𝑗, (2)
where|SV𝑖|represents the number of images on street 𝑠𝑖.
For an anchor image, we take its spatial context as the positive
sample and the representations of streets in the mini-batch as neg-
ative samples. We employ the InfoNCE [ 28] loss to optimize the

Here, we minimize L𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒to train the spatial context-based image
encoder for generating image feature representations.
3.2.2 LSTM-based Fusion. Using the spatial context-based image
encoder, each image is represented as a feature vector. As the num-
ber of street view images on a street is different, a naive method
to generate the street representation is simply averaging the fea-
ture vectors of images belonging to the street. However, such an
approach ignores the location information of these images and pre-
vents capturing the spatial relationships between images. To better
capture the physical environment observed from the perspective
of pedestrians, we sequence street view images in a specific order
and model them through the LSTM method to generate the visual
representation e𝑣𝑖𝑠𝑢𝑎𝑙
𝑖of street𝑠𝑖,
e𝑣𝑖𝑠𝑢𝑎𝑙
𝑖=LSTM({h𝑖,1,h𝑖,2,···,h𝑖,|SV 𝑖|}). (4)
Here, the LSTM model allows the fusion of varying numbers of
street view images, leveraging their spatial connection.
3.3 Street Textual Representation Learning
3.3.1 Street View Captioning. In order to enhance the prediction of
street indicators based on street view images, we propose to extract
compressed and useful semantic descriptions from these images.
Such descriptions are designed to highlight key features that are
indicative of urban street functions, rather than other less relevant
visual details.
Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), we
employ the SPHINX-V2, an image-to-text foundation model, to
generate the descriptions for street view images. This model takes
street view images and our elaborately designed instruction as input
and generates a concise yet detailed description for each image, as
illustrated in Figure 1. Our prompt is: Analyze the street view image
and provide a concise description focusing on observable elements
indicative of the street’s functions. Using our designed instruction,
we aim to guide the LLM focusing on crucial spatial information
within the images, such as buildings and infrastructure, thereby
enriching the functional analysis of urban streets.
3.3.2 Street Textual Representation. Based on the generated im-
age descriptions, we treat the street as a “document” containing
multiple “sentences” (image captions). We encode the “document”
using the pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) model to generate the textual representation

𝑖=BERT(𝐷𝑖,1,𝐷𝑖,2,···,𝐷𝑖,|SV 𝑖|), (5)
where𝐷𝑖,𝑗denotes the textual descriptions of the 𝑗th image on
street𝑠𝑖.3.4 Attention-based Fusion
We propose merging the visual and textual representations of a
street to create a more informative final representation. The two
types of representations come from different modalities: the vi-
sual representation captures the raw visual features in street view
images, while the textual representation emphasizes semantic in-
formation related to urban functions. We specifically utilize the
soft-attention mechanism to combine the two representations and
automatically determine the weight for each type of representation.

3.5 Urban Street Profiling
Following the First Law of Geography, the functional and socioe-
conomic indicators of streets have certain co-location patterns or
spatial dependencies. To this end, we construct a street network
based on spatial topology and adopt the graph neural network
(GNN) to capture the spatial relationships of streets for prediction.
3.5.1 Graph Construction Based on Spatial Topology. Using spatial
adjacency of streets, we construct an 𝑛×𝑛matrix Ato represent the
neighboring connections between streets, where 𝑛represents the
total number of streets. For each street, we identify its K-nearest
streets and designate them as neighboring connections, as outlined
in [40]. In general, we establish a graph G(V ;A), whereV=
{𝑠𝑖}𝑛
𝑖=1represents the set of 𝑛streets serving as nodes and A∈R𝑛∗𝑛
signifies the neighboring relationships among each node. If there
exists a neighboring connection between streets 𝑠𝑖and𝑠𝑗, then A𝑖,𝑗
will be set to 1; otherwise, A𝑖,𝑗will be set to 0.
3.5.2 Semi-supervised Graph Learning. Based on the constructed
graph, we take street representations as node features and urban
street profiling as our task. As labeling streets is time-consuming
and labor-intensive, only limited labels are obtained, and our street
profiling task is a typical label-scarcity task. Fortunately, GNNs are
able to learn features of the nodes based on their local neighborhood,
which allows it to work with only a small subset of the labeled nodes,
or even with completely unlabeled graphs. In this context, we use
the graph attention network (GAT) [ 32] to make semi-supervised
graph learning for prediction. We would like to point out that other
GNNs, such as graph convolutional network [ 18] and GraphSAGE
[10], can also be used here.

4 EXPERIMENT
In this session, we evaluate our model on two urban prediction
tasks with real-world datasets and compare the performance with
various baselines. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to
verify the effectiveness of each component within the proposed
USPM. At last, we assess the robustness of USPM on different sizes
of training data.
4.1 Experimental Settings
4.1.1 Datasets. Our study focuses on the area within the third ring
of Wuhan, China. The urban street network in our study consists of
5,458 streets, collected from OpenStreetMap, as shown in Figure 3.
We collect 57,396 street view images from Tencent Maps in 2018,
covering over 10,000 sampling points distributed across the area,
with images taken from four different directions at each location.
These streets are labeled with one of ten functional labels (including
residential, business office, commercial service, industrial, trans-
portation stations, administrative, educational, medical, sport and
cultural, and park and greenspace) based on the EULUC-China
dataset produced by [ 8], following the process in [ 40]. The train-
ing set consists of 295 labeled streets, with an overall annotation
rate of 5.4%. For the test set (all other streets), labels are set as the
nearest region’s true label following [ 40]. Except street functional
labels, we also collect the POI data (containing 336,454 POIs in total)
from AMap in 2018, and take the number of POIs on a street as the
street-level socioeconomic indicator following [21].

4.1.2 Model Parameters. In the module of street visual representa-
tion learning, we use the ResNet18 pre-trained on the Places 365
database [ 43] (a database designed for scene recognition) as the
backbone model, and set its output dimension as 768. For the LSTM
model that fuses image representations on a street, we adopt one-
layer LSTM and set the output dimension at 256. In the module
of street textual representation learning, we initialize the weight
and tokenizers of our text encoder from BERT1, and set the output
dimension at 768. In the module of graph construction, we set the
number of neighbors for each street (the parameter 𝐾) at 5 when
constructing graphs. In the module of semi-supervised graph learn-
ing, we adopt two-layers GAT with dropout rate being 0.6. When
training the spatial context-based image encoder, we utilize the
Adam optimizer and set the learning rate at 1𝑒−3. Then we set the
learning rate at 5𝑒−4in the attention-based fusion module and 4𝑒−3
in the semi-supervised graph learning module.
4.1.3 Baselines. We compare the performance of USPM with sev-
eral state-of-the-art methods.
•ResNet[ 13]: It is a well-established deep learning model
pre-trained on ImageNet to generate visual representations
of images.
•READ[ 11]: It is a semi-supervised model that leverages
limited labeled data and transfer learning methods on a
partially-labeled dataset to extract robust and lightweight
image representations, utilizing a teacher-student network
with pre-trained models.
•Urban2Vec[ 33]: It is an unsupervised model that utilizes
a triplet loss to learn the visual representations for street
view images, aiming to maximize the similarity of proximate
image pairs, while minimize the dissimilarity of distant pairs.
•GeoCLR[ 21]: It generates contrastive samples for augmented
images and for geographically neighboring images, and trains
a contrastive learning model to generate visual representa-
tions of street view images.

323KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Meng Chen, Zechen Li, Weiming Huang, Yongshun Gong, and Yilong Yin
•SceneParse[ 20]: It calculates the coverage ratio of every
object in the street view images to obtain the visual repre-
sentations and employs a graph-based approach to capture
the relationships between images.
•KT-BERT[ 40]: It first captures the key urban entities and
their spatial correlation in street view images and gener-
ates image descriptions based on the vision-language model.
Then it employs BERT to encode these descriptions to gen-
erate the image representations.
•UrbanCLIP[ 37]: It utilizes LLM to produce textual descrip-
tions for satellite images. Then it incorporates contrastive
learning alongside language modeling losses as supervis-
ing for learning the image encoder to generate the visual
representations of satellite images.
We use these models to encode street view images, generating
feature vectors and obtaining street representations by averaging
the features of images on a street. These street representations are
then input into our urban street profiling module.
4.2 Street Function Prediction
Street function prediction aims to predict the functional labels of
streets, which is a multi-class classification problem. We employ the
following metrics to assess the performance of various methods.
1)Accuracy (Acc): It computes the overall correctness of the
model’s prediction. We utilize 𝐴𝑐𝑐@𝐾metric, where 𝐾∈{1,3,5}.
A score of 1 is assigned if the top 𝐾predicted labels encompass the
ground truth, and 0 otherwise.
2)Weighted-F1: We also use the well-known metric Weighted-
F1 to evaluate model performance, considering the label imbalance
problem in our dataset.
3)Mean reciprocal rank (MRR): Additionally, using ˆy𝑖, we can
create a ranking list of predicted labels. Therefore, we also utilize
the metric MRR, which considers the position of real labels in the
ranking lists,
MRR =1
|S𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡||S𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡|∑︁
𝑖=11
𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖, (10)
where𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖is the rank of the real label in the predicted list for
street𝑠𝑖and|S𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡|is the number of test instances.
Table 1 reports the comparative results of different methods for
street function prediction in terms of ACC, Weighted-F1, and MRR,
where each method is run five times to obtain the average results.
From Table 1 we can make the following observations.
•ResNet, READ, and Urban2Vec obtain poor performance, as
they all directly utilize the image learning methods to ex-
tract the visual features from street view images, without
deeply considering the spatial relationship among images.
GeoCLR obtains better performance, as it maximizes the sim-
ilarity of geographically close pairs via contrastive learning,
achieving improvement over the backbone (ResNet) network.
SceneParse outperforms GeoCLR, as it recognizes the impor-
tant objects in the street view images and models the spatial
relationships among images.
•KT-BERT and UrbanCLIP obtain relatively better perfor-
mance than those methods merely capturing visual features
from images, as they generate the descriptions of street viewimages via image captioning and successfully capture the
key entities in street view images. This result suggests that
textual features learned from images can better express se-
mantic knowledge for identifying street functions than visual
features.
•The proposed USPM exhibits the best performance, because
we model the spatial relationships between images and streets
and take the textual modality as a supplement for understand-
ing street functions. For instance, compared with the best
results among baseline methods, USPM achieves an improve-
ment of 5.67% in terms of MRR. Moreover, the results of the
superiority paired t-test confirm that USPM’s improvement
over these baselines is statistically significant, with a 𝑝-value
less than 0.01.
4.3 Socioeconomic Indicator Prediction
Street-level socioeconomic indicator prediction aims to predict the
street-level indicator (i.e., the number of POIs on a street in this
study) based on the street representations. Following [ 21], we split
the indicator into 4 classes evenly and use Accuracy, Macro-F1, and
MRR as the evaluation metrics for the classification problem. To
follow the semi-supervised setting, we randomly select 310 labeled
streets (with an annotation rate of 5.7%) to train our model.
We report the comparative results for socioeconomic indicator
prediction in terms of ACC, Macro-F1, and MRR in Table 1. Com-
pared with the methods (including ResNet, READ, Urban2Vec, Geo-
CLR, and SceneParse) that capture visual features from street view
images, KT-BERT and UrbanCLIP obtain better performance, which
further validates that textual knowledge extracted from image cap-
tions contributes more to predict the socioeconomic indicator. Our
proposed USPM considers not only the spatial adjacency among
streetscapes but also the textual data from images, and obtains
the best classification performance. Compared to KT-BERT, USPM
achieves improvements of 7.98%, 21.53%, and 3.98% in terms of ACC,
Macro-F1, and MRR, respectively.
4.4 Ablation Study
Next, we conduct ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness
of different modules in USPM, including the effectiveness of the
textual modality, the spatial context-based image encoder, the LLM-
based image captioning, the LSTM-based fusion method, and the
semi-supervised graph learning method.
4.4.1 Effectiveness of Textual Modality. USPM introduces the tex-
tual modality as a supplement to complement street view imagery.
Thus, it is natural to investigate the effectiveness of incorporating
textual information into street representations. To this end, we
compare USPM with a standard visual model, named USPM-Visual,
which directly feeds the street visual representations into the street
profiling module. We also design a variant named USPM-Textual,
which directly feeds the street textual representations into the street
profiling module.
The performance comparison of USPM-Visual, USPM-Textual,
and USPM is depicted in Figure 4. It is evident that USPM-Visual
underperforms USPM, indicating that the lack of supplementary
textual information leads to a decline in performance. This under-
scores the importance of incorporating textual modality to achieve a

comprehensive street representation. When compared with USPM-
Visual, USPM-Textual yields superior results, further affirming that
textual features from LLM-generated image descriptions encompass
more semantic knowledge than visual features. USPM demonstrates
the best performance, validating the importance of integrating vi-
sual and textual features to generate street representations. Fur-
thermore, it is noteworthy that our model variant USPM-Visual still
surpasses the best results in baselines.
4.4.2 Effectiveness of Spatial Context-based Image Encoder. We
propose a new spatial context-based image encoder to capture the
spatial relationships between street view images and streets for
generating the visual representations of images. To validate theefficacy of modeling the spatial context of images, we design a
variant named USPM w/o SC which directly uses the ResNet to
encode the street view images. Figure 4 shows the performance
comparison between USPM and USPM w/o SC. The substantial
performance gaps observed between these two models suggest that
modeling the spatial context information of street view images
can promote the visual representation learning for street function
(socioeconomic indicator) prediction.
4.4.3 Effectiveness of LLM-based Image Captioning. In the pro-
posed USPM, we employ SPHINX-V2 with our designed prompt to
generate detailed textual descriptions for street view images. To val-
idate the quality of the text generated by LLM, we design a variant
325KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Meng Chen, Zechen Li, Weiming Huang, Yongshun Gong, and Yilong Yin
named USPM w/o LLM which uses a vision-language model [ 40]
trained through the Bottom-Up and Top-Down Attention to obtain
image captions for comparison. Figure 4 clearly shows that USPM
consistently outperforms this variant across all indicators. Such
results validate the ability of LLM to extract the textual semantics
of street view images.
4.4.4 Effectiveness of LSTM-based Fusion for Generating Street Rep-
resentations. To validate the effectiveness of USPM in fusing visual
representations of images on a street via a LSTM architecture to
generate street representations, we design the variant USPM w/o
LSTM, which utilizes average pooling to obtain the overall rep-
resentation of the street. As shown in Figure 4, USPM performs
better than USPM w/o LSTM obviously, suggesting that LSTM can
capture inherent spatial correlations among images on a street and
generate a more effective street visual representation.
4.4.5 Effectiveness of Semi-Supervised Graph Learning. In the pro-
posed USPM, we build an urban street network based on the spatial
adjacency among streets and employ the semi-supervised graph
learning method for prediction. To validate the effectiveness of
the semi-supervised graph learning, we design a variant named
USPM w/o Graph which directly feeds the street representations
into a fully-connected layer to make prediction. Figure 4 shows
that USPM performs better than USPM w/o Graph on both tasks,
validating the effectiveness of our proposed method.
4.5 Robustness Testing
We explore the robustness of our proposed USPM with different
training data sizes. We progressively reduce the number of training
instances from 300 to 100 with a step of 50 to explore how the
prediction performance of our method changes on both tasks. It
is important to note that we should ensure that all labels (i.e., 10
classes or 4 classes) are present in the labelled streets in the street
function (socioeconomic indicator) prediction tasks. The prediction
results with regard to different training data sizes are shown in
Figure 5. We can observe that our method shows very little decline
in predicting the socioeconomic indicator across different training
data sizes, indicating model insensitivity to the size of training
data. While for the street function prediction task, the performance
decreases when the data size is smaller than 200, which may be due
to the fact that street function identification is more challenging
and requires more comprehensive training instances.

5.1 Street View Imagery Mining
Street view images are obtained by map service providers along
the urban road network, offering additional clues about human
activities. These images usually cover most city areas, serving as a
valuable data source for analyzing urban physical environments.
Rcent studies have utilized street view images to identify the scene
elements in physical urban spaces. For example, Doersch et al.
[5] utilize visual features like windows and balconies in street
view images to automatically distinguish Paris from other cities. Li
and Carlo [ 22] collect street view images from worldwide cities to
extract the vegetation percentage and compare the greenery across
urban areas. Furthermore, street view images can be utilized for

the estimation of a building’s height and number of floors, enabling
the generation of its 3D model [19].
In addition to offering visible physical details of urban spaces,
street view imagery can also be employed in analyzing regional so-
cioeconomic characteristics. For example, Kang et al. [ 16] combine
street-level imagery, house photos and surrounding environmental
conditions to predict housing prices. Li et al. [ 21] integrate satellite
and street view imagery with city structural data, to predict socioe-
conomic indicators at street and neighborhood levels. Noorian et
al. [27] utilize street images to identify the types of POIs (stores)
located in buildings. They extract the text storefronts to categorize
the POIs into multiple types, such as bookstores and pharmacies.
Moreover, due to the development of multiple urban data collec-
tion and data mining techniques, more researchers now adopt deep
learning approaches to identify urban functions based on street
view imagery. For example, Srivastava et al. [ 29] conduct a multi-
label function classification at the building level using street view
images acquired at multiple zoom levels and corresponding govern-
ment census data. Ye et al. [ 38] work to identify urban function and
spatial quality from social media data, and use street view imagery
to enhance the performance. Zhang et al. [ 40] present to solely
rely on imagery data without other data to predict the functions of
streets. They utilize image captioning tools to generate the descrip-
tions of street images, and employ pretrained language encoder to
obtain the street semantic representations. Yan et al. [ 37] leverage
the power of Large Language Models and the knowledge of textual
modality to train an unsupervised image encoder for generating the
visual representations of satellite images. However, most current
studies solely focus on capturing the visual features of individ-
ual images, instead of integrating the visual and textual features
generated from street view imagery to yield street representations.
5.2 Large Language Model
Over the past years, LLMs have gained significant attention, show-
ing remarkable potential across various fields [ 6,7]. These models
are characterized by their extensive pre-training on large-scale
datasets, which imbues them with unparalleled emergent abili-
ties, including contextual reasoning, complex problem solving, and
zero-shot adaptability across diverse tasks [ 3,17]. Recent studies
suggest that LLMs have encoded a wealth of urban factual and
spatio-temporal knowledge from their training data. For instance,
326Profiling Urban Streets: A Semi-Supervised Prediction Model Based on Street View Imagery and Spatial Topology KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain.
Gurnee [ 9] demonstrates that LLMs learn representations of space
and time, which are resilient to changes of prompts and coherent
across different urban areas. Ji et al. [ 15] conduct various experi-
ments to indicate that LLMs can represent the geometric proper-
ties and relationships of spatial objects. Furthermore, Prabin et al.
[1] explore various LLMs’ geospatial skills, including geospatial
knowledge, awareness, and reasoning. By leveraging appropriate
prompts, LLMs can utilize the encoded geospatial knowledge to
produce the desired outcomes. To this end, several studies have
applied LLMs to a range of urban perception tasks. Manvi et al. [ 26]
extract geospatial knowledge from LLMs by using prompts aug-
mented with auxiliary map data, achieving superior performance in
real-world geospatial tasks. Zheng et al. [ 41] employ LLMs in traffic
safety applications through prompt information, including accident
reports automation, traffic data augmentation, and multisensory
data analysis. In this study, we utilize our pre-defined prompt to
steer LLMs to generate the descriptions of street view imagery,
which inherently contain the geospatial knowledge.
6 CONCLUSION
Profiling urban streets in terms of functional and socioeconomic
labels is crucial for urban planning. In this paper, we present a semi-
supervised Urban Street Profiling Model (USPM) that learns street
representations from street view imagery by integrating visual and
textual modality and predicts the functional and socioeconomic
labels of streets using a semi-supervised graph learning framework.
We first model multiple street view images on a street to learn
the street visual representation based on the spatial context-based
contrastive learning method. Powered by LLMs, we then create
the descriptions of street scenes and produce the street textual
representation. We finally combine the visual and textual repre-
sentations of a street and feed it into the semi-supervised graph
learning framework for urban street profiling. The experimental re-
sults with real-world datasets demonstrate that USPM outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline methods on two urban prediction tasks.
