Abstract
The rise of social media has intensified fake news risks, prompting
a growing focus on leveraging graph learning methods such as
graph neural networks (GNNs) to understand post-spread patterns
of news. However, existing methods often produce less robust and
interpretable results as they assume that all information within
the propagation graph is relevant to the news item, without ade-
quately eliminating noise from engaged users. Furthermore, they
inadequately capture intricate patterns inherent in long-sequence
dependencies of news propagation due to their use of shallow GNNs
aimed at avoiding the over-smoothing issue, consequently dimin-
ishing their overall accuracy. In this paper, we address these issues
by proposing the Propagation Structure-aware Graph Transformer
(PSGT). Specifically, to filter out noise from users within propa-
gation graphs, PSGT first designs a noise-reduction self-attention
mechanism based on the information bottleneck principle, aiming
to minimize or completely remove the noise attention links among
task-irrelevant users. Moreover, to capture multi-scale propagation
structures while considering long-sequence features, we present a
novel relational propagation graph as a position encoding for the
graph Transformer, enabling the model to capture both propagation

1 Introduction
In the current digital age, the rapid growth of the Internet has
provided unprecedented opportunities for the production, dissemi-
nation, and consumption of fake news [ 56]. Such deceptive news
disrupts public opinion [ 46] and social harmony [ 47], but also under-
mines trust in institutions [ 13]. Hence, effective fake news detection
methods are crucial for public access to reliable information.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [ 68,69] have recently demon-
strated their efficacy in identifying user propagation patterns, offer-
ing vital insights for fake news detection [ 4,11,11,49,51]. While
these methods have improved detection accuracy, they have not
mitigated crucial public concerns regarding the fairness and trans-
parency of such automated systems. This public skepticism has

Figure 1: (a) Illustrates noise patterns in news propagation
graphs. (b) Empirically observes noise information in two
news propagation graphs and the average observation across
all graphs in the Politifact dataset [ 45]. Using k-means [ 14],
users are divided into two groups (A and B) based on their
features. Gaussian noise, defined by a Gaussian distribution
ùúÄ‚àºùëÅ(0,1), is then injected to observe its effects. After 50 runs,
successful classifications are counted. Some groups show
minimal effects, possibly due to task-irrelevant participants
like bots or malicious users.
led many organizations to continue relying on human interven-
tion to address fake news, as it provides a clear explanation for
classifying news as either true or false. Thus, enhancing the ro-
bustness, transparency, and interpretability of fake news detection
models is essential for their final application in real-world scenar-
ios. Nonetheless, enhancing model interpretability to improve user
trust remains challenging by two critical issues. Firstly , real-world
scenarios often involve noise, such as malicious content from users
or AI, misleading models to make false predictions and explana-
tions [ 51]. Ensuring that models can eliminate this noise to provide
clear, transparent explanations without sacrificing accuracy is essen-
tial for their wider acceptance and practical application. Secondly ,
existing GNN-based detection models, including those designed
for interpretability, often struggle to balance capturing news long-
sequence propagation structures with avoiding over-smoothing,
inherent in their design to learn local patterns [ 27,60,71]. An over-
reliance on local propagation structures fails to capture key shifts in
news propagation, which can compromise detection accuracy, even
if some models provide explanations, contradicting the objectives
of practitioners.
Regarding the noisy information in propagation graphs, as il-
lustrated in Figure 1 (a), malicious users are frequently engaged
in introducing noise to news comments. Such interactions from
adversarial entities often introduce task-irrelevant noise such as
disruptive comments, negatively impacting or at best not aiding
the model interpretability and prediction [ 24,50]. Figure 1 (b) em-
pirically validates this through a case study on news propagation
graphs in Political dataset [ 45]. Intriguingly, specific user groups
within propagation graphs, such as group A, display resilience tonoise injection, possibly due to the involvement of irrelevant partic-
ipants such as bots. This resilience implies that group A is primarily
composed of noise information, as the presence of substantial task-
relevant content would have resulted in a marked decrease in model
accuracy following noise injection. In contrast, others, like group B,
show pronounced susceptibility, likely because these users featured
useful task-relevant information. Such empirical insights provide
guidelines for us to enhance both the reliability and accuracy of
fake news detection, particularly by mitigating noise impact in
news propagation graphs. Despite methods like UPFD [ 11] use
self-attention to focus on key features, recent studies [ 34,40,61]
question the efficacy of attention mechanisms in prioritizing im-
pactful features, challenging their utility in enhancing the reliable
interpretability in fake news detection.
As for tracking the long-sequence propagation dependencies in
news propagation graphs, they remain a critical yet under-explored
aspect. These dependencies capture subtle and vital shifts in user
engagements, such as comment topic changes and community evo-
lution, during information dissemination. As news diffuses, its cas-
cade depth increases, as evidenced in Appendix D.2 (Figure 6), indi-
cating a substantial propagation distance between some engaged
users and the source news. This could explain why existing fake
news detection methods [ 4,11,51] based on shallow GNNs often
merge features from the original news source into subsequent user
nodes. However, such a strategy dilutes a certain task-irrelevant
noise signal of users by mixing it with task-relevant information of
source news, thereby undermining the capability of models for effec-
tive noise filtration, as we demonstrated in Appendix D.2 (Figure 7).
While the adoption of vanilla Transformers [ 54] could intuitively
address long-sequence dependencies, recent insights [ 34,40,61]
have found that their attention mechanisms do not inherently pri-
oritize features that most significantly impact the output and fail
to adequately model the structural relationships within propaga-
tion graphs. Although some recent graph-based Transformers have
shown being promising in domains like protein prediction [ 37,67],
their architecture is not well-suited to the information diffusion-
based structure characteristic of news propagation graphs, as il-
lustrated in Appendix D.2, restricting their direct applicability in
robust and interpretable fake news detection.
In this work, we aim to address the above issues by proposing
thePropagation Structure-aware Graph Transformer (PSGT), a
novel propagation structure-aware graph Transformer designed
with innate interpretability and robustness for fake news detection.
Building on the information bottleneck (IB) principle [ 2,52], PSGT
integrates a noise-reduction mechanism within the Transformer
architecture, aiming to selectively guide task-relevant information
flow across the propagation graph while systematically eliminating
extraneous noise. This mechanism initially treats user relationships
as a fully connected attention graph, subsequently removing atten-
tion links between task-irrelevant graph components to prevent
noise transmission. The graph components, such as nodes with
abundant connected attention links in the learned noise-reduction
attention graph, are eventually identified as task-relevant, and their
propagation structure provides interpretability. The model is also
expected to be more robust due to its adept noise-filtering capa-
bilities. Furthermore, to model the long-sequence dependencies
and the distinctive structural characteristics of news propagation

graphs, we introduce a new positional encoding strategy for the
graph Transformer. This strategy models the depth and relational
distances among users in the propagation graph, enabling the Trans-
former architecture to be aware of the propagation structure.
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
‚Ä¢We design a novel noise-reduction mechanism for the graph
Transformer based on the IB principle. This mechanism ef-
fectively removes task-irrelevant attention links within the
self-attention module, yielding interpretable and robust re-
sults. To the best of our knowledge, PSGT is the first to
propose a unified graph-based IB method for interpretable
fake news detection.
‚Ä¢We present a new positional encoding approach rooted in the
propagation structure, enabling the model to capture both
the propagation structure and long-sequence dependencies,
further enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of fake
news detection.
2 Related Work
2.1 Fake News Detection
Fake news detection is generally framed as a binary classification
problem, aiming to determine the verity or falsity of a specific
news article. There are two category methods highly related to our
work: Content-based andpropagation-network-based methods.
Content-based methods have employed an array of advanced deep
learning models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [ 36]
and pre-trained language models to extract semantic signatures
from the news articles [ 26,64]. In addition to news content, vari-
ous complementary features have also been explored to enhance
prediction accuracy. These supplementary inputs encompass in-
formation drawn from knowledge graphs [ 8,12,17], corroborative
evidence from external repositories [ 7,43], visual cues from associ-
ated images [ 6,41], and environmental metadata surrounding the
news ecosystem [ 42]. Acknowledging that the spread of fake news
is inherently a social phenomenon, propagation-network-based
methods incorporate various social attributes into their frame-
works [ 4,28,44,48,51,57,60,70]. These social indicators include,
but are not limited to, user interaction metrics [ 62], social net-
work connectivity patterns [ 15,32,72], historical posting activity
of users [ 11] and provenance of the news source. Although existing
methods have proven being effective in modeling social information,
they have overlooked the critical aspect of long-sequence depen-
dencies inherent in news propagation structures. Moreover, these
approaches often suffer from low interpretability and increased sus-
ceptibility to noise within the propagation graphs, primarily due to
their inadequacy in effectively filtering out malicious information.
2.2 Graph Transformer
The Transformer architecture [ 54], a category of neural networks,
has influenced a wide array of tasks, from text to visual data process-
ing [ 53]. However, pure Transformers lack intrinsic relationships
between tokens, thus requiring additional positional encodings for
structural understanding. To address this shortcoming, recent stud-
ies have explored specialized Transformer adaptations for graph-
structured tasks [ 29,31]. These adaptations fall into two categoriesrelevant to our study: the first utilizes absolute positional en-
codings (APE) through techniques like Laplacian vectors [ 23] or
random walks [ 25] to convey nodal structure; the second employs
relative positional encodings (RPE) to enrich the attention mech-
anism with structural information derived from graph distances or
features generated by GNNs [ 67]. Additionally, some frameworks
incorporate Transformers as modular components in more com-
plex architectures [ 38]. Despite the progress, these approaches are
primarily configured for generic graph-related tasks or specific
applications such as recommendation systems [ 33]. Designing a
specialized graph Transformer to tackle fake news detection, par-
ticularly by utilizing distinct structural characteristics inherent to
news propagation graphs, remains an unsolved challenge.
3 Preliminaries
As preliminaries, we define the problem formulation and concepts.
3.1 Problem Formulation
Fake news detection can be defined as a task of binary classification.
The main objective is to train a classifier utilizing a dataset of
labeled news and subsequently employ this classifier to determine
the veracity of a given test news article.
To provide clarity in our formulation, let us denote our dataset
of news articles as C={ùëê1,ùëê2,...ùëêùëö}, whereùëêùëñdenotes the ùëñ-th
news article and ùëörepresents the total count of articles in the
dataset. Each news article ùëêùëñcan be described as a tuple ( ùë¶,G).
Here,ùë¶indicates the ground truth label belonging to either ùêπorùëÖ,
symbolizing whether the news is Fake or Real respectively. Mean-
while,G=(V,E)represents the propagation structure associated
with the news article ùëêùëñ. Specifically,V={ùë£0,ùë£1,...ùë£ùëÅ}, where
ùë£0represents the source news, and ùë£ùëñdenotes an engaged user of
the news. The set of edges Eis defined asE=
ùëíùëñùëó|ùê¥ùëñùëó‚â†0, for
ùëñ,ùëó=0,...,ùëÅ}, whereùê¥ùëñùëóis an element of the adjacency matrix
Athat indicates a direct reply or comment relationship from user
ùë£ùëñto userùë£ùëó. In this work, we follow prior work [ 11] to generate
the initial features ùë•ùëñof each node by using pre-trained BERT [ 10]
embeddings to encode the news content and users who comment
on the news.
To encapsulate the described framework: Given a news collection
Cand a set of training labels ùëåùë°ùëüùëéùëñùëõ , our goal is to train a classifier
ùëìùúô. This function, when presented with unseen test news, should
proficiently assign the corresponding veracity labels ùëåùë°ùëíùë†ùë°.
3.2 Transformers on Graphs
3.2.1 Original Transformers. The Transformer architecture is com-
posed of several Transformer layers. Each layer comprises two pri-
mary modules: a multi-head self-attention mechanism (MSA) and
a feed-forward network (FFN). The head self-attention mechanism
is crucial for identifying and comprehending the intrinsic semantic
relationships among input tokens. Given an input X‚ààRùëõ√óùëëfor
theùêªhead self-attention mechanism, where ùëõis the number of
tokens andùëëdenotes the hidden dimension, the mechanism maps
Xinto three separate spaces: Q‚Ñé,K‚Ñé, and V‚Ñé. More formally, the
projections can be described as Q‚Ñé=XW‚Ñé
Q,K‚Ñé=XW‚Ñé
K, and
V‚Ñé=XW‚Ñé
Vrespectively. For each head ‚Ñé, the self-attention can

the self-attention mechanism is combined with a skip-connection,
followed by a feed-forward network. Together, these components
constitute a Transformer layer, as illustrated below:

3.2.2 Graph Transformers. Owing to the inherent equivariance of
self-attention to input node permutations, the Transformer consis-
tently produces identical node representations for nodes with the
same attributes, regardless of their positions or graph structures.
Addressing this, recent studies have introduced positional encoding
strategies, i.e., APE and RPE. Our work aligns more closely with
RPE, for which we subsequently provide a mathematical formula-
tion. For APE insights, readers are referred to [ 31]. RPE-based graph
Transformer emphasizes relative structural relationships between
node pairs. Building on this, most preceding research has adjusted
the attention computation described in Equation (1), as follows:

action between nodes ùë£ùëñandùë£ùëó. Different parameterizations of B
yield distinct model architectures. However, prevalent RPE-based
graph Transformer methods exhibit two limitations. Firstly, they in-
terpret the network as a fully connected graph within the attention
mechanism, lacking the precision to highlight task-relevant fea-
tures and exclude noise, our method solves these issues, as detailed
in Section 4.2. Secondly, these methods, such as GraphGPS [ 37],
are only generic structure-aware, in contrast to our specifically tai-
lored propagation structures-aware RPE strategy, detailed further
in Section 4.3.
3.3 Information Bottleneck
Various techniques, including feature selection-based [ 5] and motif-
based methods [ 65], have been explored to mitigate noise in graphs.
However, these methods often impose inherent biased constraints,
notably setting constraints on the size and connectivity of task-
relevant subgraphs. For instance, in the domain of protein graphs [ 18],
functionally similar group structures exhibit consistency in size. In
contrast, domains like news propagation graphs lack this unifor-
mity, with task-relevant substructures displaying variations in size
and connectivity.
Informed by the information bottleneck (IB) principle [ 63], we
exclude the task-irrelevant noise by compressing the propagationgraphGwithout imposing any structural constraints, i.e., solving
max
Gùë†ùêº(Gùë†;ùëå), s.t.ùêº(Gùë†;ùê∫)‚â§ùõæ,Gùë†‚ààGùë†ùë¢ùëè(G) (5)
whereùõæis a compression parameter and Gùë†ùë¢ùëè(G)represents the set
of subgraphs derived from G.ùêº(ùëù;ùëû)‚âú√ç
ùëù,ùëûP(ùëù,ùëû)logP(ùëù,ùëû)
P(ùëù)P(ùëû)
represents the mutual information (MI) between variables ùëùandùëû.
Specifically, when handling irregular graph data, the IB framework
applies the constraint ùêº(Gùë†;ùê∫)‚â§ùõæ. This guides the selection of
Gùë†to absorb only pivotal information from Gto predict the label
ùëå, thereby maximizing ùêº(Gùë†;ùëå). Consequently,Gùë†plays a crucial
role in the interpretability of the model.
Recent studies have also leveraged the IB principle for graph
learning [30, 69], primarily focusing on local structures via GNNs.
However, as we mentioned before, these methods are not well-
suited for fake news detection since news propagation graphs ex-
hibit long-sequence dependencies. To our knowledge, PSGT is the
first to utilize graph IB for fake news detection, effectively eliminat-
ing noise from propagation graphs while producing interpretable
subgraphs that capture both local and long-sequence dependencies.
4 PSGT: Propagation Structure-aware Graph
Transformer
In this section, we introduce a novel graph Transformer designed
for fake news detection. We begin by providing an overview of the
proposed graph Transformer and then present a formal definition
of a feasible information bottleneck intended for noise filtration.
Next, we detail a unique positional encoding strategy for modeling
propagation structures within the graph Transformer. Finally, we
discuss the optimization techniques applied to PSGT.
4.1 Overview of the Proposed Graph
Transformer
We propose an innovative graph Transformer specifically designed
for fake news detection. Notably, this model has the capability to
eliminate noise while capturing the long-sequence dependencies
characteristic inherent in propagation structures. The main differ-
ence between our proposed graph Transformer and the existing
graph Transformer architecture lies in the MSA. Within a standard
MSA layer, there are ùêªattention heads, each implicitly focusing
on different representational subspaces of various nodes. In con-
trast, our model employs a graph-masking mechanism, compelling
these heads to explicitly focus on different subspaces through graph
masks.
As illustrated in Figure 2, our approach begins with the integra-
tion of a feasible information bottleneck. This mechanism learns a
noise-filtered mask graph, Gùë†(as detailed in Section 4.2), rooted in
a fully connected attention graph. This guides the attention mech-
anism of graph Transformer to emphasize task-relevant features.
To further enhance the ability of the Transformer to capture news
propagation patterns, we introduce a new propagation structure
modeling strategy. This strategy is tailored for the explicit con-
struction of a structural positional encoding mask, Gùëù(as detailed
in Section 4.3), grounded in real-world news propagation princi-
ples. Based on this, we modify the self-attention score computation

Figure 2: The architecture of PSGT. From a given news propa-
gation graph, we first learn a noise-reduced subgraph Gùë†and
subsequently construct a more realistic propagation graph
Gùëù. TheGùë†primarily retains task-relevant attention links
between users for enhanced interpretability, while Gùëùcap-
tures both the propagation depth and distance relationships
among users. Then, using Gùë†andGùëùas graph masks, the
graph Transformer effectively captures propagation struc-
tures and long-sequence dependencies, while filtering out su-
perfluous noise. For label prediction, a binary cross-entropy
loss is applied, and a Kullback-Leibler (KL) loss is employed
for noise-reduced subgraph learning. Both losses are com-
bined for optimal model training.

where Aùëñbelongs to the set{Aùë†,Aùëù,Aùëì}. Here, Aùë†,AùëùandAùëì=
1|V|√ó|V| represent the adjacency matrices for Gùë†,Gùëù, and a fully-

defined as:
M(ùë•,ùúÜ)=ùë•+ùúÅùúÜ (7)
whereùúÅis a sufficiently large value. This approach, while simple,
effectively ensures the attention mechanism recognizes structuralcharacteristics and excludes noise information. Given the three
types of graph masks Gùë†,Gùëù, andGùëì, we divide heads into four
groups. The first two are masked using Aùë†andAùëù, whereas the
latter two utilize Aùëì. Note that within Aùëì, we avoid imposing any
structural bias, granting the model the most freedom to learn latent
node interrelations. Subsequently, the node representations in ùëô-th
Transformer layer, Zùëô={z1,z2,...,zùëõ}, are obtained by the FFN
described in Equation (2).

The inherent attention mechanism within the Transformer does
not selectively prioritize key features that predominantly influence
the output. Consequently, we develop a strategy to learn a noise-
filtered graph mask Gùë†for the self-attention mechanism in graph
Transformer. This aims to enhance the ability of the model to em-
phasize task-relevant features and simultaneously filter out noise
information.
4.2.1 A Feasible Graph IB Objective . LetA‚Ñédenote the self-attention
matrix derived from the first head in Transformer layer ùëôviaAttn‚Ñé(X).
This can be viewed as a fully-connected attention graph, G‚Ñé=
(V,Eùëìùë¢ùëôùëô,Zùëô‚àí1), where Zùëô‚àí1is the output of previous Transformer
layer and Z0=X. Building on this, PSGT first aims to train an
extractorùëíŒ¶with parameter Œ¶to construct task-relevant attention
subgraphGùë†‚ààGùë†ùë¢ùëè(G‚Ñé). By design, ùëíŒ¶encourages the attention
mechanism to eliminate task-irrelevant information by removing
the noise attention links in G‚Ñé, ensuring only task-relevant infor-
mation is retained in Gùë†. In essence, ùëíŒ¶(G‚Ñé)offers a distribution
overGùë†ùë¢ùëè(G‚Ñé), expressed as PŒ¶(Gùë†|G‚Ñé).
Integrating this into Equation (5), we formulate the optimization
criterion for ùëíŒ¶leveraging the IB principle:
min
Œ¶‚àíùêº(Gùë†;ùëå)+ùõΩùêº(Gùë†;G‚Ñé), ùë†.ùë°.Gùë†‚àºùëíŒ¶(G‚Ñé), ùõΩ>0 (8)
We then follow previous works [ 2,35,63] to derive a feasible varia-
tional upper bound for terms present in Equation (8). For the term
ùêº(Gùë†;ùëå), a parameterized variational approximation Pùúô(ùëå|Gùë†)
replaces P(ùëå|Gùë†), yielding the lower bound:
ùêº(Gùë†;ùëå)‚â•EGùë†,ùëå[logPùúô(ùëå|Gùë†)]+ùêª(ùëå) (9)
Considering ùêª(ùëå)is a constant, it is extraneous during optimization.
Notably, in our context, Pùúô(ùëå|Gùë†)functions as the predictor or
the binary classifier ùëìùúô, which predicts the label ùëåofGbased onGùë†.
For the other term ùêº(Gùë†;G‚Ñé), a variational approximation Q(Gùë†)is
introduced for the distribution P(Gùë†)=√ç
GPŒ¶(Gùë†|G‚Ñé)PG‚Ñé(G‚Ñé),
resulting in the upper bound:
ùêº(Gùë†;G‚Ñé)‚â§EG[KL(PŒ¶(Gùë†|G‚Ñé)‚à•Q(Gùë†))] (10)
Combining these bounds for Equation (8), PSGT objective becomes:
min
Œ¶,ùúô‚àíE
logPùúô(ùëå|Gùë†)
+ùõΩE[KL(PŒ¶(Gùë†|G‚Ñé)‚à•Q(Gùë†))](11)
In Equation (11), the first term Pùúôserves as a classifier ùëìùúô. Conse-
quently, only the terms PŒ¶andQneed further specification, which
we will describe in Section 4.2.2 and Section 4.2.3, respectively.

4.2.2 Noise-Reduction Self-Attention Mechanism via PŒ¶.The func-
tionPŒ¶(Gùë†|G‚Ñé)essentially serves as the extractor ùëíŒ¶, designed to
extract the task-relevant attention subgraph Gùë†fromG‚Ñé. Notably,
due to the densely connected nature of G‚Ñé, it contains superflu-
ous and noise attention connections that remain unaddressed by
standard self-attention mechanisms.
To address this, we model all attention links as a collection of
independent Bernoulli random variables, each parameterized by its
respective learned weight ùúÖ:
As=√ò
ùë¢,ùë£‚ààEùëìùë¢ùëôùëô
ùëéùë¢,ùë£‚àºBernoulli ùúÖùë¢,ùë£	
(12)
The probability ùúÖ, governing the sampling of attention links, is
optimized within the Transformer architecture. Specifically, the
graphG‚Ñéis first encoded by the Transformer, yielding a set of
node representations {zùë£|ùë£‚àà V} . Subsequently, for each node
pair(ùë¢,ùë£), an multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layer combined with
a sigmoid activation functions as the extractor ùëíŒ¶, transforming
the concatenated pair (zùë¢,zùë£)into a probability value ùúÖùë¢,ùë£‚àà[0,1].
Here, a lower ùúÖùë¢,ùë£indicates a more noise-prone relationship, thus
suggesting a reduced weight or exclusion of the attention link.
However, a challenge arises with Aùë†, given its non-differentiability
with respect to ùúÖdue to its Bernoulli nature. To solve this, we employ
the concrete relaxation technique [ 19] for the Bernoulli distribution:
Bernoulli ùúÖùë¢,ùë£‚âàsigmoid1
ùë°
logùúÖùë¢,ùë£
1‚àíùúÖùë¢,ùë£+logùúñ
1‚àíùúñ
(13)
whereùúñ‚àºBernoulli(0,1)andùë°acts as the temperature for this con-
crete distribution. Thus, the distribution of Gùë†givenG‚Ñé,PŒ¶(Gùë†|G‚Ñé),
can be defined as PŒ¶(Gùë†|G‚Ñé)=√é
ùë¢,ùë£‚ààEùëìùë¢ùëôùëôP ùëéùë¢,ùë£|ùúÖùë¢,ùë£.
4.2.3 Variational Approximation via Q.The bound presented in
Equation (10) holds universally for any Q(Gùë†). For optimization
efficiency, we also define it as another Bernoulli distribution. Given
a graphGsampled from PG, we can get the only G‚Ñéfrom the
first attention head in Transformer. For every node pair ( ùë¢,ùë£)
within the fully connected attention graph G‚Ñé, we sample Àúùëéùë¢ùë£from
Bernoulli(ùúå), whereùúåis a hyperparameter in [0, 1]. We subsequently
remove all existing attention links in G‚Ñéand adds links ( ùë¢,ùë£) when
Àúùëéùë¢ùë£=1. Suppose the obtained task-relevant attention subgraph is Gùë†,
we have Q(Gùë†)=√ç
GP(Àúùëé|G‚Ñé)PG(G‚Ñé). Thus, taking into account
two Bernoulli distributions, P(Gùë†|G‚Ñé)andQ(Gùë†), and omitting
constants, the second term of Equation (11) can be described as:
KL(PŒ¶(Gùë†|G‚Ñé)‚à•Q(Gùë†))=
‚àëÔ∏Å
(ùë¢,ùë£)‚ààEùëìùë¢ùëôùëôùúÖùë¢,ùë£logùúÖùë¢,ùë£
ùúå+ 1‚àíùúÖùë¢,ùë£log1‚àíùúÖùë¢,ùë£
1‚àíùúå(14)
After extracting subgraph Gùë†, the classifier ùëìùúôemploys the masked
Transformer, which shares the same parameters as before, to map
Gùë†into a graph representation using an averaging readout function.
This representation is then passed through an MLP layer followed
by a softmax function to model the distribution of ùëå, yielding the
distribution Pùúô(ùëå|Gùë†).
4.2.4 Guaranteed Noise Reduction in Attention Graph G‚Ñé.PSGT,
following the IB principle, enhances graph Transformer‚Äôs focus
on task-relevant features while effectively eliminating superfluous
attention links in the self-attention graph G‚Ñé. This strategy not onlyprovides model interpretability for the model but also reinforces the
robustness. LetGùúñbe a graph solely comprised of those superfluous
attention links inG‚Ñé. We then give the following theorem, which
suggests that minimizing the objective in Equation (8) inherently
minimizes the relevance between Gùë†andGùúñ:
Theorem 4.1. Letùëåbe determined solely by the optimal task-
relevant attention graph ÀúGùë†extracted by ùëíŒ¶, and withGùúñdefined as
the noise attention graph satisfying ÀúGùë†‚à™Gùúñ=G‚Ñé. When we select
Gùë†equivalent to ÀúGùë†, it essentially leads to maximizing the objective
ùêº(Gùë†;ùëå)‚àíùõΩùêº(Gùë†;G‚Ñé).
Proof of this theorem is detailed in the Appendix A. In essence,
Theorem 4.1 suggests that optimizing the objective in Equation (8)
forcesGùë†to become increasingly unrelated to extraneous attention
links inGùúñ.
4.3 Propagation Structure Modeling
Up to now, we do not explicitly leverage structural information
from observed propagation graphs, which is often recognized as
important for modeling propagation behavior. While many exist-
ing strategies [ 4,51] primarily use adjacency matrices, focusing
mainly the first-order propagation relationships among users, our
method offers a more realistic view by examining real-world news
propagation patterns.
We define the propagation relationship between users in terms of
both distance and depth. The distance aspect quantifies the shortest
path length between two nodes in the propagation graph, mim-
icking the fact [ 3] that if two users are distantly connected in the
propagation structure, they might engage in different topics even
under the same news, hence sharing less correlation. On the other
hand, the depth relationship measures the shortest path from a user
to the source news, effectively simulating the prevalent phenome-
non of information decay [ 9] during propagation. As discussions
around news deepen, users might veer into topics deviating from
the original news theme. These users who participate in such off-
topic discussions are less valuable for news classification. Therefore,
for any node pair ( ùë¢,ùë£) inG, our proposed propagation structure
modeling module explicitly captures these phenomena, as follows:
ùëùùë¢ùë£=ùëí1
ùëëùë¢ùë£¬∑ùëí‚àíùëëùë¢+ùëëùë£
2 (15)
In Equation (15), the first and second terms denote the distance
and depth relationships, respectively. Here, ùëëùë¢ùë£defines the shortest
path length between node ùë¢andùë£, whileùëëùë¢indicates the shortest
path length from node ùë¢to the source news. For computational
efficiency, we only calculate the shortest path for node pairs whose
shortest path is not longer 2, i.e., ùëëùë¢ùë£‚â§2. Moreover, by setting the
shortest path length to 2, this strategy more intuitively reflects the
local structural features of the propagation graph. When combined
with the Transformer‚Äôs ability to characterize long sequence de-
pendencies, indicative of global structure characteristics, the model
achieves a more comprehensive understanding of the propagation
structures at both local and global levels. This approach yields
the graphGùëù, with its adjacency matrix Aùëùconstructed by Equa-
tion (15). As we mentioned in Section 4.1, by incorporating Gùëùas a
graph mask within the graph Transformer, PSGT adeptly captures
both the propagation depth and distance relationships among users.

4.4 Optimization and News Classification
The overall optimization objective of PSGT comprises two loss
terms: the binary classification loss Lùëêùëôùë†defined in Equation (9) and
KL lossLùêæùêødefined in Equation (14). For the binary classification
lossLùëêùëôùë†, we utilize the standard cross-entropy loss. To specify this,
we first extract graph-level representations of the news using a
readout function:
s=Readout(A)=1
|V|‚àëÔ∏Å
ùë£ùëñ‚ààVzùëñ (16)
Subsequently, this representation is processed through an MLP
followed by a softmax function to predict the news label ÀÜùëåfor a
given snews itemùëêùëñ. Hence,Lùëêùëôùë†is expressed as:
Lùëêùëôùë†(ùëå,ÀÜùëå)=‚àí(ùëålogÀÜùëå+(1‚àíùëå)log(1‚àíÀÜùëå)) (17)
whereùëå‚àà{0,1}means the label for each piece of unverified news.
Finally, the total optimization objective is then L=Lùëêùëôùë†+Lùêæùêø.
4.5 Comparison with Existing Related Methods
Recent studies applying the IB principle to graph learning have
primarily focused on local structures through GNNs [ 30,69]. How-
ever, in PSGT, the application of IB fundamentally differs from
existing approaches, and we have adopted this powerful concept to
tackle the specific challenges of interpretable fake news detection.
Unlike existing graph IB methods that modify the original graph
structure, PSGT leverages the IB principle to filter noisy attention
connections within the self-attention layer of Transformers. This
is critical because, even if we remove the noise propagation edge
between nodes and in the original news propagation graph, the
self-attention mechanisms can still naturally and inadvertently rely
on toxic correlations between these nodes, giving a higher atten-
tion weight to them [ 40,61]. Furthermore, GNN-based methods
often fall short in capturing the extended sequence dependencies in
news propagation, limiting their effectiveness in practical scenarios.
PSGT stands out as the first method to employ graph IB for Trans-
former in fake news detection, successfully filtering noise while
generating interpretable subgraphs that comprehensively capture
local and long-sequence dependencies.
Additionally, while several graph Transformer methods [ 31], e.g.,
GraphGPS [ 37], have been proposed for applications like protein
design, they are not ideally suited for fake news detection, failing to
account for unique news propagation features, such as information
decay [ 9]. Our novel graph Transformer model addresses this gap
by considering propagation depth and user distance relationships,
enhancing both the accuracy and interpretability of fake news de-
tection. Notably, our model excels in using propagation graphs for
this purpose. However, the core principles of our model, particularly
the propagation structure-based positional encoding strategy, have
broader applicability. They can potentially be adapted to various
propagation-based graphs, including social, information, and infec-
tious disease networks [ 58]. We aim to explore these applications
in future work.5 Experiments
5.1 Experimental Setup
5.1.1 Datasets. Our study focuses on the impact of news propaga-
tion structure and user engagement in fake news detection, utilizing
the FakeNewsNet dataset, which includes PolitiFact and GossipCop
sub-datasets. Each entry comprises a news piece, related Twitter
posts, user interactions, and a "Real" or "Fake" label assigned by
experts. We preprocess the data following the methods in [ 11], us-
ing 75% of the articles for training and the remainder for testing.
Detailed dataset statistics are available in Appendix C.1.
5.1.2 Comparison Methods. To explore the impact of news prop-
agation structures, we benchmark our PSGT algorithm1against
various known methods, which span both content-based meth-
ods (M1) and propagation-structure-based methods (M2). In the
content-based category, we consider CSI[39], which employs an
LSTM network to learn sequential retweet features, as well as Bert-
MLP andSpacy-MLP, which classify news using MLPs based
on 768-dimensional and 300-dimensional features encoded by pre-
trained BERT [ 10] and spaCy [ 16] word2vec models, respectively.
We also consider UniPF [59], which develops a semantic-clustering
strategy for fake news detection. For propagation-network-based
methods, we include GCN [22], a well-known graph neural network
(GNN) that uses a message propagation mechanism to learn repre-
sentations for users and news items; GAT [55], which distinguishes
node importance through an attention mechanism; GraphGPS [37],
a graph Transformer approach incorporating positional encod-
ing;BiGCN [4], which employs two separate GCNs for model-
ing both the propagation-directed and dispersion-directed graphs;
UPFD [11], which integrates the social history of users and news
features into a GNN architecture; GACL [51], introducing an adver-
sarial contrastive learning strategy into rumor detection; EBGCN [60],
a probabilistic model that captures propagation uncertainty by en-
coding propagation trees with edge-enhanced Bayesian networks;
andGSAT [30], which employs a graph information bottleneck
technique for optimization purposes; DECOR [62], which refines
social graph structures by applying a degree-correction mecha-
nism to better align with real-world social dynamics; HGFND [20],
which uses hypergraph neural networks to capture complex rela-
tional data in news propagation networks, enhancing the detection
of fake news through higher-order relationship modeling; and Fin-
erFact [21], which employs a fine-grained reasoning framework
and dual-channel graph network for subtle evidence differentiation,
enhancing detection capabilities and explainability.
Detailed information on evaluation metrics, experimental set-
tings, and implementation is provided in Appendix C.
5.2 Overall Performance
Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate that PSGT consistently outperforms
competing baseline methods across both datasets. Several key ob-
servations can be informed from these results: (1) Advantage of
Propagation-Structure-Based Methods: Methods based on prop-
agation structure yield a marked improvement in performance over
those relying solely on content. This aligns well with expectations,

as the former captures both the propagation structure and the fea-
tures of news into unified node representations, thereby amplifying
accuracy. (2) Superiority of PSGT: Among the techniques that
leverage propagation structure, our proposed PSGT outshines all
competitors. This highlights the effectiveness of PSGT to extract
both structural patterns and feature information. (3) Comparison
with Other GNN-Based Methods: Specifically, PSGT outperforms
GNN-based methods like BiGCN, UPFD, GACL, and EBGCN, whichare developed with the aim of detecting fake news. Their underper-
formance can be attributed to their reliance on shallow GNN archi-
tectures that are not capable of capturing long-sequence features.
(4) Comparison with Graph Transformer and IB Methods:
Interestingly, even methods such as GraphGPS, which accounts
for long-sequence features, and GSAT, which employs an infor-
mation bottleneck, do not surpass PSGT. This likely stems from
their inability to simultaneously capture the unique graph struc-
ture inherent to news propagation while filtering out extraneous
noise. These insights collectively validate the effectiveness of PSGT,
which thoughtfully considers both propagation structure and noise
filtration, in detecting fake news on real-world social media.
5.3 Robustness
In real-world fake news tasks, robustness is essential, especially
since fake news propagation graphs often face noise disruptions. To
test the robustness of our model, we incorporated Gaussian noise,
characterized by a Gaussian distribution ùúÄ‚àºùëÅ(0,1), into node
features and removed 20% of the edges. When assessing accuracy
by introducing varying noise levels to node features, our results in
Figure 3 revealed that our PSGT consistently outperformed base-
lines, even when some, like GAST, employed strategies like IB for
key feature selection, or GACL used adversarial learning to elimi-
nate noise. Intriguingly, we found that a certain proportion of noise
could enhance performance. This finding aligns with previous re-
search [ 4] indicating a minimal influence from non-root nodes in
news propagation graphs, with optimal noise levels refocusing the
model on the root node, thereby improving its overall performance.

sistently surpasses baselines across various noise levels.
5.4 Interpretability
An interpretable result aids individuals in understanding which
parts of the data the model leverages, with minimal cognitive ef-
fort [ 66]. When the model exhibits high accuracy, its generated
explanations do not only clarify the model‚Äôs workings but also
shed light on the dataset. For instance, they can highlight which
users or propagation structures are pivotal for fake news detection.
We begin by visualizing a propagation graph from PolitiFact com-
prising 58 nodes. This graph size is optimal for visualization, and
4659Propagation Structure-Aware Graph Transformer for Robust and Interpretable Fake News Detection KDD ‚Äô24, August 25‚Äì29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain.
other graphs display similar patterns. As shown in Figure 4 (a), the
source news node ( ùëñùëë=0) and its immediate neighbors carry higher
attention weights, indicating the emphasis of the model on early
propagation. This aligns with prior research [ 32], highlighting that
initial engaged users often provide pertinent comments.
Building on the observation that the most interpretable aspects
often reside in the initial propagation structure, an intriguing ques-
tion arises: for a user with a limited cognitive resources, how ef-
fectively can they derive insights? To address this, we execute an
automatic quantitative experiment, wherein we extract small early
propagation subgraphs from PolitiFact at various cognitive loads.
Specifically, beginning with the root node, we employ a breadth-
first search algorithm to extract 5% to 35% of the nodes and their
associated edges. These subsets represent varying cognitive loads.
These subgraphs are then input into our models. Figure 4 (b) demon-
strates that PSGT surpasses the baselines across all cognitive loads
and performs exceptionally well, even at minimal cognitive de-
mands. Interestingly, the baselines also perform well at a mere 5%
cognitive load. This can be attributed to the limited noise in the
5%data subset, allowing these models to primarily depend on the
source news without disruptive interactions. However, in contrast
to the baselines, our PSGT approach incorporates a noise-filtering
mechanism. Hence, as cognitive load increases, the model can still
extract value without being overly affected by noise.

6 Conclusion
In this paper, we have introduced PSGT, a propagation structure-
aware graph Transformer, specifically designed for interpretable
fake news detection. By incorporating a graph Information Bottle-
neck strategy, PSGT inherently provides robust and interpretable
results. Guided by the IB principle, our proposed graph Transformer
effectively filters out task-irrelevant information through a noise-
reduction attention graph, enhancing the reliability in interpretabil-
ity. Additionally, we have presented a unique positional encoding
strategy tailored for the Transformer architecture, enabling PSGT
to capture both long-sequence dependencies and the propagation
structure effectively. Extensive evaluations comparing PSGT with
various known methods, including those based on GNNs, graphTransformers, and IB principles, demonstrate the effectiveness of
PSGT in providing robust and interpretable fake news detection
outcomes.

A Proof of Theorem 4.1
Proof. We adopt similar technicalities in [ 1] to prove Theo-
rem 4.1. Consider a fully connected attention graph, denoted as
G‚Ñé, which is determined by noise attention links Gùúñand the au-
thenticity label ùëåof the news ùëê. Let the optimal task-relevant at-
tention graph,Gùë†, depend onGùúñsolely viaG‚Ñé. This relationship
can be captured by the Markov Chain ‚ü®(ùëå,Gùúñ) ‚Üí G‚Ñé‚Üí Gùë†‚ü©.
Given thatGùúñrepresents noise attention links, and is therefore
unrelated and independent of ùëå, it follows that ùêª(ùëå|Gùúñ)=ùêª(ùëå)
andùêª(ùëå| Gùúñ;Gùë†) ‚â§ùêª(ùëå| Gùë†). Invoking the data processing
inequality, we deduce:
ùêº(Gùë†;G‚Ñé)‚â•ùêº(Gùë†;ùëå,Gùúñ)
=ùêº(Gùë†;Gùúñ)+ùêº(Gùë†;ùëå|Gùúñ)
=ùêº(Gùë†;Gùúñ)+ùêª(ùëå|Gùúñ)‚àíùêª(ùëå|Gùúñ;Gùë†)
‚â•ùêº(Gùë†;Gùúñ)+ùêª(ùëå)‚àíùêª(ùëå|Gùë†)
=ùêº(Gùë†;Gùúñ)+ùêº(Gùë†;ùëå)(18)
This concludes the proof. ‚ñ°
B Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of PSGT is primarily influenced by the con-
struction of the propagation graph and the design of the Trans-
former architecture. Specifically, we employ the Dijkstra algorithm
to determine the depth relationships between the source news and
all users. This has a time complexity of O(|V| log|V|+|E| log|V|) .
Retrieving second-order neighbors for all nodes incurs a cost of
O(|E||V|) . Given that our Transformer architecture involves a cal-
culation of attention similar to standard Transformer designs, its
complexity stands at O(|V|2). Regarding the IB principle, the first
term has a complexity of O(|V|) , while the second term has a com-
plexity ofO(ùëë|V|) . Consequently, for a training dataset comprising
ùëönews articles, the overall time complexity of PSGT amounts to
O(ùëöùëë|V|2).
C Implementation Details
C.1 Dataset and Graph Statistics
We present a detailed statistical analysis of the datasets utilized in
this study, as shown in Table 3. The dataset used has few nodes pergraph, so the average depth of news propagation graphs does not
exceed 4, though some reach higher depths, as Figure 6 illustrates.
C.2 Experimental Settings and Implementation
Following the prior work [ 11], we initialize word embeddings using
768-dimensional feature vectors that have been pre-trained via
BERT on extensive corpora. These settings are applied to both the
PolitiFact and GossipCop datasets. We stack two Transformer layers
with 128 hidden dimensions each. Training is conducted over 600
epochs, with model parameters updated using the Adam optimizer
at a learning rate of 0.001. ùõΩandùúÅare not tuned and are set to 1 and
103, respectively. Temperature parameter ùë°used in Equation (13)
is also not tuned, and we set it as 1 for all datasets. The number
of Transformer layers is set to 2 for all datasets. To ensure the
robustness of our findings, we average the experimental outcomes
across ten independent runs. Experiments are performed using the
PyTorch framework on a Linux server equipped with Nvidia V100
GPUs.
C.3 Evaluation Metrics
In line with previous works [ 11,51], we employ a quartet of com-
monly utilized evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of
various fake news detection techniques. These metrics include Ac-
curacy (Acc.), Precision (Prec.), Recall (Rec.), and F1 Score (F1).

D.1 Ablation Study
Our model comprises three essential modules: the News Propaga-
tion Structure, the Information Bottleneck (IB) Principle, and the
Transformer Architecture. These modules are responsible for sim-
ulating propagation behavior, eliminating irrelevant information,
and capturing long-range dependencies, respectively. To quantify
the contributions of each of these modules, we conducted an abla-
tion study. For this study, we created three model variants:
‚Ä¢"w/o N" removes the News Propagation Structure module.
‚Ä¢"w/o I" is a variant without the IB Principle

‚Ä¢"w/o T" replaces the Transformer Architecture with the
Graph Attention Networks (GAT) architecture, which is a
type of GNNs that also has a self-attention mechanism.
Results presented in Figure 5 clearly show that the omission of any
of these modules results in a decrease in model performance. This
leads us to several key observations: (1) Both news features and
propagation structures are essential for effective model learning. (2)
The IB Principle contributes to the model by effectively filtering out
noisy data, thereby enhancing accuracy. (3) The Transformer Archi-
tecture outperforms GAT, despite both having self-attention mech-
anisms, emphasizing the importance of long-sequence-dependent
features in news propagation graphs. For an extended compari-
son between GNNs and Transformer architectures, please refer to

In realistic information diffusion-based news propagation graphs,
the depth of the propagation cascade can be substantial, indicat-
ing a large propagation distance between some engaged users and
the source news. For instance, in a news propagation graph with
141 nodes as depicted in Figure 6, many nodes have a propagation
distance from the source news exceeding three orders. When em-

scenarios, the information from these nodes cannot be efficiently
passed to the source news, nor can it capture the source news infor-
mation adequately. This limitation explains why existing fake news
detection techniques relying on shallow GNNs often incorporate
features from the source news into subsequent user nodes.
However, this strategy has a disadvantage as it dilutes the noise
signal of user nodes by blending it with source news, thereby harm-
ing the ability of models for effective noise filtration. For example,
when concatenating the features of source news to a noisy user
node, the noise information gets diluted by the relevant features of
the source news, which negatively impacts model learning. Unlike
existing GNN-based fake news detection methods, our proposed
PSGT model has an inherent ability to capture long sequence depen-
dencies without the need for extra concatenation. This capability
allows non-noise but distant nodes to self-adapt and capture in-
formation from the source news efficiently, without the risk of
introducing noise to the source news. To empirically validate this,
we conducted an experiment comparing the performance between
our PSGT and GNN-based fake news detection methods, with and
without concatenation of source news features.
Figure 7 shows typical GNN-based methods improve perfor-
mance when concatenating source news features to user nodes,
whereas our PSGT exhibits the opposite behavior. This finding high-
lights the inefficacy of shallow GNNs in capturing long-sequence
features within the propagation graph effectively. As for the ob-
served decline in PSGT performance, a reasonable explanation
is that after injecting all nodes with root node information, the
noise node information is diluted by the features of task-relevant
news nodes, leading the model to misidentify these noise nodes as
non-noise nodes. Consequently, their original noise information is
transmitted to other nodes, deteriorating the quality of the learned
node representation and thereby reducing experimental accuracy.
