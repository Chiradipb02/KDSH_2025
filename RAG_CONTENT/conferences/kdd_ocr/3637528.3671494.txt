ABSTRACT  
Cybersecurity remains a grand societal challenge. Large and 
constantly changing  attack surfaces are non -trivial to protect 
against malicious actors. Entities like the  United States and the 
European Union have recently emphasized the value of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) for advancing cybersecurity . For example, the 
National Science Foundation has called for AI systems that can 
enhance cyber threat intelligence, detect new and evolving threats, 
and analyze massive troves of cybersecurity data. The 4th Workshop 
on Artificial Intelligence -enabled Cybersecurity Analytics ( co-
located with ACM KDD ) sought to make significant and novel 
contributions  within these relevant topic s. Submissions were 
reviewed by highly qualified  AI for cybersecurity researchers and 
practitioners spanning academia and private industry firms.

Society’s growing reliance on computing technology has  
solidified cybersecurity as a grand societal challenge .  Academics, 
government agencies, and industry professionals have increasingly 
turned to AI to bolster existing efforts for robustifying cyber 
defenses  [1, 2] . Recent advancements in modern AI such as Large 
Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI hold significant  
opportunities for  both attackers and  defenders to enhance their 
cybersecurity capabilities .  
Now i n its fourth year, this workshop invited  completed 
research papers, work in progress , and review articles that address 
important problems related to AI -enabled cybersecurity analytics. 
This workshop attracted a wide range of  submissions on diverse 
topics includ ing intrusion detection, security for LLMs, LLMs for 
cybersecurity risk management frameworks , and more.  
2 Topics of Interest for the Workshop  
This workshop sought to attain a diverse set of submissions 
about various topics related to AI -enabled cybersecurity analytics 
[3, 4] . Therefore, areas of interest for this workshop included, but 
were not limited to:  
• IP reputation services (e.g., blacklisting)  
• Anomaly and outlier detection  
• Phishing detection (e.g., email, website, etc.)  
• Dark Web analytics (e.g., multi -lingual threat detection, key 
threat actor identification)  
• Large -scale and smart vulnerability assessment  
• Real-time alert correlation for usable security  
• Weakly supervised and continual learning for intrusion 
detection  
• Adversarial attacks to automated cyber defense  
• Automated vulnerability remediation  
• Internet of Things (IoT) analysis  
• Misinformation and disinformation  
• Deep packet inspection  
• Static and/or dynamic malware analysis and evasion  
• Automated mapping of threats to cybersecurity risk 
management frameworks  Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or

summarize their data, algorithm details, performance metrics, 
statistical tests, and case studies in their submissions. Providing 
public releases of data and code was strongly encouraged to help 
facilitate scientific reproducibility.
