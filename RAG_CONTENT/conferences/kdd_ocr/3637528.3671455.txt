Abstract
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a grow-
ing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mech-
anistic models mathematically describe the transmission mecha-
nisms of infectious diseases. However, they often fall short when
confronted with the growing challenges of today. Consequently,
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively
popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to
furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and
highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective,
we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and
methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this
domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those
typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology,
we categorize existing work into Neural Models andHybrid Models.
Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examina-
tion of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their
technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of exist-
ing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose
future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature
gaps and promote the progression of this promising field. We hope
that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs
and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.

1 Introduction
Epidemiology has long been a critical field, with its origins tracing
back to ancient societies that observed patterns of disease spread [1,
2]. Although the conceptualization of epidemiology has evolved
over time, the terms health andcontrol have been predominantly
associated with it since 1978 [3]. Currently, the World Health Orga-
nization (WHO) describes epidemiology as the investigation into
the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events,
encompassing issues including disease transmission, vaccination
efforts [4, 5], cancer and diabetes treatment, etc. This definition un-
derscores the field’s emphasis on controlling health-related issues
and making informed decisions.
To address a range of health-related challenges, there is an indis-
pensable need for epidemic modeling, and researchers have devised
various mechanistic models [6, 7]. These models, grounded in math-
ematical formulations, simulate the dissemination of infectious
diseases by incorporating biological and behavioral underpinnings.
By considering factors such as population, they yield insights into
patterns of disease transmission and the efficacy of intervention
strategies, thereby shaping public health policies [8, 9]. However,
these knowledge-driven methods often depend on oversimplified
or fixed assumptions that can lead to biases in modeling. Conse-
quently, this compromises both the accuracy of predictions and
their ability to generalize across different contexts.
To overcome the limitations of mechanistic models, there is
an emerging trend to adopt data-driven approaches in epidemic
forecasting tasks, with a particular emphasis on machine learning
and deep learning models [10]. Specifically, Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have
demonstrated great success in various epidemiological predictive
tasks, including forecasting daily new case counts, estimating virus
reproduction and doubling times, and determining disease-related
factors [11, 12, 13]. Despite their effectiveness in these tasks, these
models often fall short in incorporating relational information from
critical epidemiological data sources such as human mobility, geo-
graphic connections, and contact tracing. This deficiency restricts
their utility in broader epidemiological applications.
Recently, the advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [14,
15, 16, 17] have set the stage for overcoming the aforementioned
challenges in epidemic modeling. Specifically, GNNs stand out for
6577

their ability to aggregate diverse information through a message-
passing mechanism, making them particularly suited for capturing
relational dynamics within graphs [18, 19]. Thus, by representing
interactions between entities as graphs, researchers can leverage
GNNs to harness relational data effectively and facilitate epidemi-
ology tasks [20, 21]. For instance, GNNs are often utilized to model
spatial interactions [22] and other complex interactions [23], en-
hancing the analysis of graph data and yielding more precise predic-
tions. In addition, GNNs bring a certain level of interpretability by
quantifying the influence of individual nodes (or entities) on final
prediction [24]. Moreover, the flexible design of GNNs facilitates
their integration with traditional mechanistic and probabilistic mod-
els to leverage expert knowledge and offer measures of uncertainty.
As a result, GNNs have found extensive applications in various
tasks within the field including infection prediction [25] , outbreak
source detection [26], intervention modeling [27], etc., facilitating
advancements in epidemiology research.
Contributions. Given the pivotal role of epidemic modeling and
the growing use of GNNs, a systematic review of these algorithms
is vital for advancing the field. This paper aims to bridge the gap
with an in-depth overview and categorization of GNN applications
in epidemiology. Our objective is not just to spotlight current re-
search but also to identify future research avenues, enriching the
GNN and epidemiology fields. By categorizing tasks, summariz-
ing methodologies, and suggesting future directions, we hope to
support researchers venturing into this interdisciplinary area.
Connection to Existing Surveys. Unlike earlier surveys focusing
on epidemiology and deep learning, which mainly predict COVID-
19 outcomes and seldom cover GNN-based methods [10, 28, 29, 12],
our paper provides an in-depth overview of GNNs in epidemic mod-
eling. Previous studies have incorporated GNNs but often in limited
contexts [30, 13], mostly virus transmission tasks. Our research,
uniquely focused on GNN approaches, spans a wider array of epi-
demic modeling tasks and presents the most current review of GNN
applications, delivering deeper insights than existing literature.
2 preliminaries and definitions
2.1 Learning on Graph Data
In this paper, we define the graph data as 𝐺=(𝑉,E), with𝑉
representing the node set comprising |𝑉|=𝑁nodes. The edge set
E⊆𝑉×𝑉represents the connections between nodes. The feature
matrix X={x1,x2,...,x𝑁}⊤∈R𝑁×𝐷includes feature vectors x𝑖
associated with node 𝑣𝑖, where𝐷denotes the feature dimension.
The adjacency matrix of 𝐺, denoted by A∈R𝑁×𝑁, sets A𝑖𝑗=1for
any existing edge 𝑒𝑖,𝑗∈EandA𝑖𝑗=0otherwise. The normalized
adjacency matrix is given by ˆA=D−1/2AD−1/2. The degree matrix
D, being a diagonal matrix, is characterized by D𝑖,𝑖=Í
𝑗A𝑖,𝑗.
In the domain of graph learning, the node-level task stands out
as a significant area of focus. The objective of this task is to forecast
the properties (i.e ., numerical value or probability) or class of the
individual nodes. This process entails training a neural network
model that utilizes a subset of nodes with known properties, de-
noted asV𝐿, to infer the properties of other unknown nodes. The
essence of this training is encapsulated by optimizing the function:
min𝜃L(𝑓𝜃(𝐺))=∑︁
𝑣𝑖∈V𝐿ℓ(𝑓𝜃(X,A)𝑖;𝑦𝑖), (1)where the function 𝑓𝜃(X,A)aims to forecast the property for each
node, with𝑦𝑖representing the actual state of node 𝑣𝑖. The discrep-
ancy between the predicted and true properties is quantified using
a loss function ℓ(·,·), such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
Over recent years, GNNs have garnered increasing interest and
have been deployed across diverse fields, including bioinformat-
ics, material science, chemistry, and neuroscience [31, 32, 33, 34].
Among them, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) [15] and Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) [16, 17], have advanced the frontier of
research on graph-structured data with their sophisticated and ef-
fective designs [14, 35, 36]. Typically, GNNs aim to learn graph
representations, including node embeddings h𝑖∈R𝑑, by utilizing
both the structural and feature information of a graph 𝐺. The pro-
cess within a GNN involves two key operations: message passing
and aggregation of neighborhood information. This involves each
node in the graph repeatedly collecting and integrating informa-
tion from its neighbors as well as its own attributes to enhance its
representation. An 𝐿layers GNN can be described as:
h(𝑙+1)
𝑖=𝜎(h(𝑙)
𝑖,AGG(h(𝑙)
𝑗;𝑗∈A𝑖)),∀𝑙∈[𝐿], (2)
where h(𝑙)
𝑖denotes node 𝑣𝑖representation at layer 𝑙, starting with
h(0)
𝑖=x𝑖as initial features. A𝑖is node𝑣𝑖’s neighbors, with AGG(·)
and𝜎as the aggregation and activation functions, respectively.
After𝐿layers,ℎ𝑖undergoes a projection for final prediction.
2.2 Mechanistic Models
Empirical models [37, 38] in epidemic forecasting utilize historical
data to discern patterns and forecast the future spread of diseases. In
contrast, mechanistic models [39, 40] provide a detailed framework
that explores the biological and social complexities underlying the
transmission of infectious diseases, thus exceeding the reliance
on historical data inherent to empirical models. Among mechanis-
tic approaches, classic compartmental models [41] (e.g ., SIR) are
particularly notable. These models adeptly simplify the intricate
dynamics of disease transmission into digestible components. This
simplification facilitates a clearer understanding of infection spread,
serving as a valuable tool for both researchers and policymakers.
SIR Compartmental Model . In the domain of epidemiology [42,
43], it is widely hypothesized that the rate at which networks evolve
is significantly slower compared to the propagation speed of dis-
eases. This fundamental assumption underpins the adoption of a
SIR model [41, 44], which is instrumental in accurately capturing
the dynamics of epidemic spread. The SIR model categorizes the
population into three distinct groups based on their disease status:
susceptible (S) to infection, currently infectious (I), and recovered
(R), with the latter group being immune to both contraction and
transmission of the disease. The SIR model, formulated using ordi-
nary differential equations (ODEs) [45], are as follows:
𝑑𝑆(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡=−𝛽𝑆(𝑡)𝐼(𝑡)
𝑁,𝑑𝐼(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡=𝛽𝑆(𝑡)𝐼(𝑡)
𝑁−𝛾𝐼(𝑡),
𝑑𝑅(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡=𝛾𝐼(𝑡).(3)
These equations distribute the total population 𝑁across the afore-
mentioned categories, with the transitions between states regulated
by two pivotal parameters: the transmission rate 𝛽(𝑆→𝐼) and

the recovery rate 𝛾(𝐼→𝑅). The model posits a quadratic relation-
ship for disease transmission via interactions between susceptible
and infectious individuals ( 𝛽𝑆(𝑡)𝐼(𝑡)), alongside a linear recovery
mechanism ( 𝛾𝐼(𝑡)). By fine-tuning the parameters of the SIR model,
it is possible to compute the basic reproduction number 𝑅0=𝛽/𝛾,
serving as a metric for the disease transmission potentials [46, 47].
SIR Variants. The SIR model’s simplicity overlooks factors like
incubation periods and non-permanent immunity, prompting the
development of more detailed SIR variants. These include: i)SEIR
[48]: Adds an ‘Exposed’ compartment for those exposed but not
yet infectious [41, 49], enriching the SIR model to better capture
disease progression stages: 𝑆→𝐸→𝐼→𝑅.ii)SIRD: Introduces a
’Dead’ compartment to account for disease mortality, altering the
progression to: 𝑆→𝐼→𝑅→𝐷. This modification accounts for
individuals who succumb to the disease [50, 51, 52].
The EpiLearn Library. To facilitate the development of mecha-
nistic models and promote their integration with neural models, a
Python library named EpiLearn [53] has recently been developed
for the benefit of both epidemiologists and data scientists. It pro-
vides a comprehensive set of tools for simulating data, training and
evaluating epidemic models, as well as visualizing epidemic data.
For more details, we recommend referring to the paper.
3 Taxonomies
3.1 Epidemiological Tasks
For epidemiological tasks, we provide a taxonomy from the perspec-
tive of epidemiologists and categorize the work into four categories
based on researchers’ goals: Detection, Surveillance, Prediction,
andProjection. A brief comparison of these tasks is shown in
Table 1; the detailed explanations are introduced as follows:
3.1.1 Detection. The goal of detection tasks is to identify health
states, disease spread, or other related incidents that happened at a
specific time . In this survey, we incorporate two different detection
tasks from the view of graph data: source detection andtransmission
detection. To formulate a mathematical definition, the temporal
network, which consists of sequenced graphs from different time
points, is represented as 𝐺={𝐺0,𝐺1,...,𝐺𝑇}. Within a graph
𝐺𝑡, the states of nodes and edges are represented by 𝑆𝑉
𝑡and𝑆E
𝑡
respectively. Then, the detection task can be expressed as predicting
𝑆𝑉
𝑡or𝑆E
𝑡given graph 𝐺𝑇and time point 𝑡.
For example, finding patient-zero [74, 54, 47], as a source de-
tection task, is important for identifying the source of disease out-
breaks and aims to find a set of nodes 𝑉on graph𝐺0. In this setting,
the problem can also be seen as identifying the state of each node
at the initial time point, which is 𝑆𝑉
0.
3.1.2 Surveillance. Surveillance tasks aim at providing timely and
accurate information to support decision-making and disease pre-
vention. Since a prompt response is needed, real-time processingability has been the most important requirement during model-
ing. Here, we provide a formal definition: given a temporal graph
𝐺={𝐺0,𝐺1,...,𝐺𝑇}, the goal is to identify a target statistic yon
graph𝐺𝑇at the present moment or in the short term.
To illustrate, tasks like detecting infected individuals promptly
[75] and estimating infection risks in different locations in real-
time [55, 56, 76, 46] can be seen as surveillance tasks, as they their
prediction targets lie in present or near future.
3.1.3 Prediction. Similar to surveillance tasks, prediction tasks
also aim to forecast epidemic events using historical data. How-
ever, unlike surveillance tasks, prediction tasks typically involve
longer time spans anddo not require real-time processing . There-
fore, prediction tasks are more interested in predicting the target
at the longer time ahead like 𝑇+1instead of at time 𝑇. Due to the
large amount of work, we further classify prediction tasks into two
categories based on the type of prediction target:
(1)Incidence Prediction. The target of incidence prediction is to pro-
vide quantitative results. In epidemic forecasting, incidences can
include the number of infections or deaths in the future [77, 78,
79, 80, 64, 65, 81, 82, 83], influenza activity level [84], Influenza-
Like Illness (ILI) rates [85], vaccine hesitancy [86], etc. The
prediction of these incidences is important to decision-making,
proactive public health planning, and the effective management
of infectious diseases and other health challenges.
(2)Trend Prediction. Different from incidence prediction tasks, the
target of trend prediction tasks is to identify epidemic spreading
patterns. For transmission among locations [59], prediction of
infection trend is formulated as an information retrieving prob-
lem and the goal is to predict the next region to be infected given
a historic spreading route. For transmission among individuals
or groups, the goal usually includes identifying transmission
dynamics in emerging high-risk groups [87].
3.1.4 Projection. Projection tasks are similar to prediction tasks,
but with an additional intention to understand epidemic outcomes .
These tasks usually require models with the ability to incorporate
changes during the evolution of epidemics. Most of the projec-
tion tasks we collected involve finding the optimal interventions
ormaximizing influence to achieve targets like curbing the spread
of diseases. Influence maximization [88] aims to identify a subset
of nodes so that the epidemic spreads most effectively across the
graph, e.g., node importance ranking [89, 90].
In this paper, we extend the traditional setting of influence
maximization and combine it with intervention strategy tasks to
form a more general definition as follows: Given a temporal graph
𝐺={𝑉(𝑡),E(𝑡)}, the states of nodes ∈𝑉and edges∈Eare influ-
enced by strategies defined as 𝑃𝑣(𝑡)and𝑃E(𝑡), which represents
strategies on nodes and edges respectively. The goal of the task is to
find optimal strategies so that the target is maximized or minimized.
For example, vaccine strategy tasks [57] aim to vaccinate the opti-
mal set of nodes to minimize epidemic damage. For interventions
throughout the period, strategies can include applying quarantine
level to nodes [58] and restricting mobility on edges [91, 27], which
denotes𝑃𝑣(𝑡)and𝑃E(𝑡).
3.1.5 Perspectives from Data Scientists. Besides the epidemiolo-
gists’ perspective, it is also feasible to categorize these works from

data scientists’ view. Here we provide a further taxonomy of the
computational pipeline in terms of model inputs andoutputs:
(1)For model inputs, they consist mainly of two elements: node fea-
tures and the graph structure. Based on the temporal characteris-
tics of nodes, we can further categorize these work into spatial-
only tasks, temporal-only [85], and spatial-temporal tasks.
In addition, based on the temporality and learnability of graph
structure, we can also use static ordynamic classifications to
distinguish these works.
(2)In terms of model outputs, we summarize these works as fol-
lows: scalar, graph, and action sequence. Scalar outputs are
usually used in prediction tasks which provide indicators of the
epidemic like infected cases. Some works focus on epidemic
graph construction and their outputs are graphs [92, 55]. Finally,
the projection tasks we collected adopt Reinforcement Learning
(RL), which outputs the actions taken at each time step, forming
a consecutive action sequence [57, 58, 91, 27].
3.2 Graph Construction
For graph construction, we provide a taxonomy based on the dy-
namicity of nodes and edges as follows.
Static Node Features. Static node features typically refer to char-
acteristics that do not change with time. The shape of static features
can be represented as R𝑁×ℎ, whereℎrefers to the number of fea-
tures. Besides tasks involving time series, most GNN tasks are using
static features. For example, in a contact graph in which individuals
are modeled as nodes and contact information represents edges,personal characteristics like gender and age can be used as static fea-
tures during training and prediction [75]. However, tasks involving
time series can also use static features as additional information.
Dynamic Node Features. Contrary to static features, dynamic
features represent characteristics that change through time. This
type of data is commonly seen in time-series forecasting tasks and
the models usually require inputs at each time point. Therefore,
the shape of the dynamic features can be represented as R𝑁×𝑇×ℎ,
where𝑇refers to the number of time points given. As an example,
the number of daily confirmed cases in a region can be seen as
dynamic features [73]. Although most models take in a single slice
of dynamic features at each time point, some models use the entire
dynamic features across time 𝑇in a single input [74].
Static Graph Structure. Static graph structures are generated
from existing data, which are consistent across training or different
times. For example, geographical adjacency 𝐴often links various
regions (nodes) in the graph 𝐺for multi-regional tasks, using re-
gion distance or other criteria for edge weights [93, 78]. Another
strategy explores human mobility or transitions, e.g., linking nodes
through nearest neighbors in the case of COVID-19 transmission.
This method takes into consideration the distribution of the pop-
ulation and individual movements between various locations [59,
55]. When nodes represent individuals, contact information may
be used as connections to identify disease-spreading risks [94, 95].
Dynamic Graph Structure. Determining the structure of a dy-
namic graph commonly involves one of two methodologies. One
approach is the modification of adjacency relations over time or
throughout the virus propagation process. For example, [91] utilize
E(𝑡)={𝑒𝑢𝑣(𝑡)}to represent the set of edges at time step 𝑡, which

connect individuals based on transmission probability. Another
strategy entails the learning of adaptive edges or edge weights
during the training phase. Given the dynamic nature of disease
transmission, which evolves at each time step, traditional geograph-
ical adjacency matrices fall short of accurately representing true
connectivity. Recent studies [51, 20, 23] have aimed for models
to learn an adaptive relationship between nodes. This typically
involves initially generating node features via a neural network,
followed by the computation of an attention matrix to depict dy-
namic connectivity, often expressed as A𝑡=𝑎𝑖,𝑗∈R𝑁×𝑁, where
𝑎𝑖,𝑗indicates the influence of node 𝑣𝑗on node𝑣𝑖.
3.3 Methodological Distinctions
The methodologies of the GNNs in epidemic modeling can be
broadly classified into two categories: Neural Models andHy-
brid Models. This classification illuminates the extent of methods
that combine computational techniques with epidemiological in-
sights. Both categories employ neural networks, yet they diverge
in their underlying principles. (a) Neural Models primarily focus
on a data-driven approach and leverage the power of deep learning
(i.e., GNNs in our paper) to uncover complex patterns in disease
dynamics without explicit encoding of the underlying epidemio-
logical processes. (b) On the other hand, Hybrid Models represent
a synergistic fusion of mechanistic epidemiological models with
neural networks. This integration allows for the structured, theory-
informed insights of mechanistic models to complement the flexible,
data-driven nature of GNNs, aiming to deliver predictions that are
interpretable, accurate, and grounded in theoretical knowledge.
4 Methodology
In this section, we provide a detailed illustration of the methods
in epidemic modeling, all of which utilize GNNs as the backbone
model as shown in Figure 1. We organize these approaches into two
main categories, as previously introduced in Section 3.3: Neural
Models andHybrid Models. This categorization hinges on whether
mechanistic models are integrated.
4.1 Neural Models
When utilizing GNNs for epidemic modeling, numerous studies
have exclusively employed GNNs without incorporating mechanis-
tic models into their tasks, which we term Neural Models. These
models excel at learning from raw data, identifying complex pat-
terns across varied inputs, and significantly boosting task perfor-
mance. In this subsection, we delve into the (GNN-based) NeuralModels in epidemic modeling, dissected through three perspec-
tives: (a) Spatial Dynamics Modeling, (b) Temporal Dynamics
Modeling, and (c) Intervention Modeling. This categorization
is designed to specifically tackle the challenges of modeling the
spatial spread, temporal evolution, and the impact of intervention
strategies through the advanced capabilities of GNNs.
4.1.1 Spatial Dynamics Modeling. One advantage of GNNs, e.g.,
GCN or GAT, is their ability to capture spatial relationships through
various aggregation processes, which can analyze and capture the
spatial dimensions of disease propagation. Numerous studies rep-
resent the inherent structure of geographical data as graph data,
denoted as A, where nodes depict regions (e.g., cities, neighbor-
hoods, or countries), and edges describe connections between these
regions (e.g., roads, flights, or potential vectors for disease trans-
mission). Subsequently, GNNs are applied to the graph data to un-
cover complex relationships and dependencies at the regional level,
facilitating predictions regarding disease spread across different
areas [96, 97, 63, 94, 98].
In the context of GNN modeling, the significance of edge weights
is paramount, as they encapsulate the intensity and nature of inter-
actions. Within epidemiological studies, these weights are often de-
rived from the mobility or social connectedness between regions [62,
99]. For instance, studies such as [27, 68] utilize Origin-Destination
(OD) flows to quantify inter-regional mobility, thereby dynamically
capturing the intensity of transmission. To further enhance the spa-
tial context of each node within the graph, some research advocates
for the implementation of positional encoding techniques [100, 101].
These techniques are designed to augment the nodes’ spatial aware-
ness. For example, Liu et al. [59] introduced a unique encoding for
each location, denoted as 𝑃𝐸(𝑘), with even and odd elements rep-
resented by sin(𝑘/10000𝑖/𝐿)andcos(𝑘/10000𝑖−1/𝐿)respectively,
where𝐿denotes the dimension of the encoding.
While GNNs have shown success in modeling spatial relations,
challenges arise when dealing with varying input data. Specifically,
the absence of direct structural information and the introduction
of more complex structural information pose additional difficulties
during modeling. To tackle these challenges, several studies have
attempted solutions, as outlined below.
Adaptive Structure Learning. There are occasions when adja-
cency relationship information is not available in the real world,
often due to data scarcity. To overcome this challenge, several
studies highlight the importance of learning an adaptive structure
throughout the training process [70, 69]. For instance, Wang et
al.[69] introduced a graph structure learning module, denoted as
𝑓𝜃. This module is designed to calculate node similarities, thereby
representing spatial relationships as follows:
M1=tanh(𝑓𝜃1(𝛼X1)),M2=tanh(𝑓𝜃2(𝛼X2)),
A=ReLU(tanh(𝛼(M2M⊤
2−M1M⊤
1))),(4)
where X1andX2are randomly initialized, learnable node embed-
dings, while 𝛼represents a hyper-parameter. Shan et al. [92] em-
ployed a method to estimate the graph Laplacian from COVID-19
data through convex optimization of derived eigenvectors. This
approach aims to identify dynamic patterns of pandemic spread
6581KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Zewen Liu, Guancheng Wan, B. Aditya Prakash, Max S. Y. Lau, and Wei Jin
among countries by analyzing their structural relationships. Addi-
tionally, inspired by recent advancements in attention-based mech-
anisms [102, 103, 104], a considerable portion of research suggests
the use of an attention matrix to illustrate the relationships between
nodes [20, 51, 105]. Notably, Cola-GNN [20] pioneers the applica-
tion of additive attention in learning the adaptive structure, which
is defined as follows: 𝑎𝑖,𝑗=v𝑇𝑔(W𝑠h𝑖+W𝑡h𝑗+b𝑠)+𝑏𝑣, where𝑔
is an activation function, W𝑠,W𝑡∈R𝑑×𝐷,b𝑠∈R𝑑, and𝑏𝑣∈Rare
trainable parameters, with 𝑑as a hyperparameter controlling the
dimensions of these parameters. 𝑎𝑖,𝑗reflects the impact of location
𝑗on location 𝑖. This approach allows for dynamic adaptation to
changes in graph structure, effectively capturing asymmetric and
complex viral transmission patterns.
Multi-Scale Modeling. Previous approaches typically operate at
a singular level, overlooking the multifaceted nature of real-world
epidemiological data, which encompasses multiple scales such as
country, state, and community levels. For epidemiological tasks,
multi-scale modeling is imperative for capturing the dynamics of
disease spread across these varied levels, from individual behaviors
to global dissemination. HierST [70] leverages multi-scale mod-
eling to effectively capture the spread of COVID-19 across differ-
ent administrative levels by constructing a unified graph, which
encapsulates the spatial correlation dynamics both within and be-
tween these levels. To further address both local interactions and
long-range dependencies, MSGNN [65] is designed to integrate
influences from both immediate and broader regions on disease
transmission.
4.1.2 Temporal Dynamics Modeling. The temporal dynamics in
epidemiological models are pivotal for capturing the evolution of
disease spread. These models typically conceptualize graphs as
spatio-temporal networks, underscoring the significance of tempo-
ral data in comprehending disease dynamics, and forecasting future
trends [60, 106]. A particular strand of research utilizes RNN-based
models (e.g ., LSTM or GRU), as mechanisms to extract node features.
These features are then incorporated into the graph convolution
process [107, 70]. A simple way [108] to achieve this by executing
the concat operator: h=MLP(x𝑡|x𝑡−1|...|x𝑡−𝑑)where his simply
the output of an MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) over the node fea-
tures xat time𝑡reaching back 𝑑days. Another surge of approaches
executes graph spatial convolution in each time step separately, and
then leverages all outputs of the GNNs as the input of the temporal
module and utilizes them for final downstream tasks like the pre-
diction [22, 106, 109, 110]. STEP [66] execute the multi-layers graph
convolution operation to get all node embedding h, and then lever-
age the GRU to get the final output: h𝑡=z𝑡◦h𝑡−1+(1−z𝑡)◦h′
𝑡,
where h𝑡is the final result, and z𝑡is the result of the update gate,
which controls the inflow of information in the form of gating.
The Hadamard product of z𝑡andh𝑡−1represents the information
retained to the final memory at the previous timestep.
In contrast to the initial two methodologies, numerous studies
achieve their final output by iteratively layering GNN and temporal
models [111]. Some work [112, 54] advocate for the employment
of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) [113, 114,
115] to extract insights from multivariate spatiotemporal epidemic
graphs. An STGNN integrates many ST-Conv blocks, which com-
prise a spatial layer flanked by two temporal layers. Each temporallayer features a 1-D CNN operating along the time axis, followed
by a Gated Linear Unit (GLU), to delineate the temporal dynam-
ics. The spatial layer utyeahilizes a GCN based on the Chebyshev
polynomials approximation [116, 117] for spatial analysis. To fur-
ther refine the understanding of spatial dynamics during disease
evolution, RESEAT [71] proposes the continuous maintenance and
adaptive updating of an attention matrix. This process aims to
capture regional correlations throughout the input data period:
𝑡𝑝𝑡
𝑖,𝑗(A)=A𝑡
𝑖·A𝑡
𝑗,A𝑡+1
𝑖,𝑗=softmax(𝑎𝑡+1
𝑖,𝑗+𝑡𝑝𝑡
𝑖,𝑗(A)),
where A𝑡
𝑖,𝑗∈Rdenotes the attention weight between regions 𝑖and
𝑗at time step 𝑡; then𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑖=Í𝑁
𝑗=1A𝑡
𝑖,𝑗·x𝑗is employed as the final
feature for the node 𝑣𝑖. Through this mechanism, RESEAT adeptly
captures not only temporal patterns but also the dynamically evolv-
ing regional interrelationships. To integrate explicit observations
with implicit factors over time, Cui et al. [105] introduced a new case
prediction methodology within an encoder-decoder framework.
They contend that relying solely on observed case data, which can
be inaccurate, may impair prediction performance. Accordingly,
their proposed decoder is designed to incorporate inputs of new
cases and deaths, thereby dynamically reflecting temporal changes.
4.1.3 Intervention Modeling. Intervention modeling offers a de-
tailed perspective on epidemic spread by simulating the behaviors
and interactions of individuals within a network based on inter-
vention strategies. This method provides an intricate view of in-
dividual actions, mobility patterns, and the likelihood of disease
transmission. When combined with GNN, this approach enhances
the model’s capability to represent the diversity and complexity
inherent in real-world social networks. Song et al. [27] introduced
a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes
public health interventions to strike a balance between controlling
the epidemic and minimizing economic impact. To delve deeper
into the individual underlying dynamics, Meirom et al. [91] pro-
posed a dual GNN module strategy. One module updates the node
representations according to dynamic processes, while the other
manages the propagation of long-range information. Subsequently,
they employ RL to modulate the dynamics of social interaction
graphs and perform intervention actions on them.
IDRLECA [24] embodies a novel integration, combining an in-
fection probability model with an innovative GNN design. The
infection probability model calculates the current likelihood of
each individual’s infection status. This information, along with
personal health and movement data, is utilized to forecast virus
transmission through human contacts using the GNN:
𝑝𝑖,infected =1−ˆ𝑝𝑖,healthy =1−𝑝𝑖,healthy,𝑇×(1−𝑝𝑐)contacts,(5)
here𝑝𝑖,infected represents the probability that individual 𝑖is infected,
while𝑝𝑖,healthy,𝑇denotes the baseline probability of individual 𝑖
being healthy at time 𝑇, before accounting for contact-related risks.
𝑝𝑐refers to the probability of infection from a single contact. Addi-
tionally, a custom reward function is designed to simultaneously
minimize the spread of infections and the associated costs, striking
a balance between health objectives and economic considerations:
𝑟=− exp(Δ𝐼/𝜃𝐼)+exp Δ𝑄/𝜃𝑄. (6)
6582A Review of Graph Neural Networks in Epidemic Modeling KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
This function considers the change in the number of infections ( Δ𝐼)
and the cost of mobility interventions ( Δ𝑄), with𝜃𝐼and𝜃𝑄acting
as soft thresholds for these changes.
4.2 Hybrid Models
Unlike Neural Models described above, Hybrid models merge neural
networks’ predictive power with mechanistic models’ fundamental
principles, boosting accuracy and interpretability. These can be split
into Parameter Estimation for Mechanistic Model andMechanistic
Informed Neural Model. The former updates mechanistic model
parameters with neural networks to reflect current epidemic trends,
while the latter integrates mechanistic priors into neural networks,
infusing domain knowledge and guiding learning toward realistic
disease dynamics. This approach leverages neural models’ data-
driven insights while grounding predictions in epidemiological
theory for a well-rounded epidemic prediction strategy.
4.2.1 Parameter Estimation for Mechanistic Models. This line of
research highlights that hybrid models, which integrate neural net-
works, dynamically adjust the parameters of mechanistic models.
This combination enables the analysis of real-time data, thus inform-
ing and refining mechanistic models to ensure their simulations
accurately mirror the dynamics of actual epidemics [57, 61, 98].
Notably, studies like [98, 118] employ GNNs to estimate the con-
tact (transmission) rate, 𝛽, and to monitor the epidemic evolution
through the implementation of the SIR model. Further, research [22,
61] estimates both the transmission rates 𝛽and recovery rates 𝛾
by leveraging outputs from the GNN. This methodology initiates
with the utilization of GRU to derive node embeddings h, which
subsequently facilitate the calculation of parameters:
𝛽,𝛾=MLP 1(h) Δ𝐼,Δ𝑅=MLP 2(h), (7)
where Δ𝐼andΔ𝑅denote the daily increases in the number of
infected and recovered cases, respectively. To enhance the model’s
ability to leverage the dynamics of the pandemic for regulating
longer-term progressions, the researchers utilize the predicted trans-
mission and recovery rates to calculate predictions based on the
dynamics of the disease spread:
ˆΔ𝐼𝑑=h
ˆΔ𝐼𝑑
𝑡+1,ˆΔ𝐼𝑑
𝑡+2,..., ˆΔ𝐼𝑑
𝑡+𝐿𝑝i
,
each ˆΔ𝐼𝑑
𝑖=𝛽𝑆𝑖−1−𝛾𝐼𝑖−1=𝛽(𝑁𝑝−ˆ𝐼𝑑
𝑖−1−ˆ𝑅𝑑
𝑖−1)−𝛾ˆ𝐼𝑑
𝑖−1,
ˆΔ𝑅𝑑=h
ˆΔ𝑅𝑑
𝑡+1,ˆΔ𝑅𝑑
𝑡+2,..., ˆΔ𝑅𝑑
𝑡+𝐿𝑝i
,each ˆΔ𝑅𝑑
𝑖=𝛾𝐼𝑑
𝑖−1,(8)
where𝐼𝑑
𝑖−1and𝑅𝑑
𝑖−1are calculated using the previous day actual
infected and recovered cases. 𝑁𝑝is the population size, 𝑡time steps,
and𝐿𝑝is the forecast horizon. The researchers then propose two
loss functions for short and long-term pandemic trends.
To go beyond single-region recognition, MepoGNN [68, 119] ex-
tends the SIR model to the metapopulation variant [120, 121, 122],
accommodating heterogeneity within populations and incorporat-
ing human mobility to model the spread between sub-populations:
𝑑𝑆𝑖(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡=−𝛽𝑖(𝑡)·𝑆𝑖(𝑡)𝑁∑︁
𝑗=1ℎ𝑗𝑖(𝑡)
𝑃𝑗+ℎ𝑖𝑗(𝑡)
𝑃𝑖
𝐼𝑗(𝑡),
𝑑𝐼𝑖(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡=𝛽𝑖(𝑡)·𝑆𝑖(𝑡)𝑁∑︁
𝑗=1ℎ𝑗𝑖(𝑡)
𝑃𝑗+ℎ𝑖𝑗(𝑡)
𝑃𝑖
𝐼𝑗(𝑡)−𝛾𝑖(𝑡)·𝐼𝑖(𝑡),
𝑑𝑅𝑖(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡=𝛾𝑖(𝑡)·𝐼𝑖(𝑡).(9)MepoGNN incorporates a spatio-temporal GNN designed to learn
three dynamic parameters: 𝛽𝑖(𝑡+1),𝛾𝑖(𝑡+1), and H(𝑡), throughout
the evolving timeframe. Here, H(𝑡)signifies the epidemic propa-
gation matrix, capturing human mobility between regions, repre-
sented by{ℎ(𝑡)𝑖𝑗|𝑖,𝑗∈{1,2,...,𝑁}}. The model thereby generates
its final prediction of daily confirmed cases as follows:
𝑦𝑖(𝑡)=𝛽𝑖(𝑡)∑︁𝑁
𝑗=1 ℎ𝑗𝑖(𝑡)/𝑃𝑗+ℎ𝑖𝑗(𝑡)/𝑃𝑖𝐼𝑗(𝑡), (10)
Recent work [25] integrates the Cola-GNN [20] framework with the
SIR model through the development of Epi-Cola-GNN, introducing
a mobility matrix Πto capture the dynamics of infectious disease
spread across different locations. Within this matrix, 𝜋𝑖𝑗quantifies
the intensity of human mobility from location 𝑖to location𝑗, offer-
ing a nuanced perspective on the spatial transmission of diseases.
This incorporation leads to a modification in the representation of
infectious cases within the SIR model framework:
𝑑𝐼𝑖
𝑑𝑡=𝛽𝑖𝐼𝑖−𝛾𝑖𝐼𝑖−𝑁∑︁
𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝑖𝜋𝑖,𝑗𝐼𝑖+𝑁∑︁
𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝑖𝜋𝑗,𝑖𝐼𝑗. (11)
Furthermore, they introduce the concept of the Next-Generation
Matrix (NGM) [123], which provides a clearer epidemiological inter-
pretation and more effectively supports both intra-location spread
and inter-location transmission influenced by human mobility.
Instead of simply estimating the rates, EpiGCN [124] innovates
by using three separate linear layers to convert node features into
SIR states, improving the model data awareness:
𝑆𝑣=𝜎(W𝑠·h𝑣+𝑏𝑠),𝐼𝑣=𝜎(W𝑖·h𝑣+𝑏𝑖),𝑅𝑣=𝜎(W𝑟·h𝑣+𝑏𝑟).
Subsequently, they refine the process of updating the SIR model
(Eq. (3)) and introduce a novel SIR message-passing mechanism
that aggregates information from neighboring nodes. This approach
modifies the conventional SIR update equation to incorporate spa-
tial dependencies and interactions within the network:
𝑆𝑣=𝑆𝑣−Wtran·concat
𝑆𝑣,∑︁
w∈A𝑣𝑒𝑤𝐼𝑤
, 𝑅 𝑣=𝑅𝑣+Wrecov·𝐼𝑣,
𝐼𝑣=𝐼𝑣+Wtran·concat
𝑆𝑣,∑︁
w∈A𝑣𝑒𝑤𝐼𝑤
−Wrecov𝐼𝑣,
where Wtran∈R2𝐷×𝐷andWrecov∈R𝐷×𝐷denote the matrices
for linear transformations corresponding to the transmission and
recovery processes, respectively. Ultimately, the SIR states are con-
catenated and transformed to align with the prediction objectives:
𝑦𝑣=softmax Woutput·concat(𝑆𝑣,𝐼𝑣,𝑅𝑣). (12)
4.2.2 Mechanistic-Informed Neural Models. Unlike previous meth-
ods wherein neural networks dynamically adjust the parameters of
mechanistic models based on data inputs, mechanistic-informed neu-
ral models utilize domain knowledge from mechanistic models to
inform the architecture and learning processes of GNNs. This strat-
egy flexibility allows for a swift adaptation to changing conditions,
markedly improving the accuracy of forecasts and the effective-
ness of interventions. Certain studies [125, 55, 95] utilize the SIR
model to generate target data by simulating epidemic spreads from
individual nodes, which are then employed to train GNNs for down-
stream tasks. In the context of source detection tasks, such as those
discussed in [26, 47, 54], one-hot encoded node states 𝑥𝑡
𝑖∈{0,1}𝑀,
6583KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Zewen Liu, Guancheng Wan, B. Aditya Prakash, Max S. Y. Lau, and Wei Jin
with𝑀representing the number of possible states, are used as in-
puts for the GNN, where the states are defined as either {S, E, I, R} or
{S, I, R}. Song et al. [27] integrated SIHR (a variant of SIR) [126] sim-
ulation environment with the RL framework, providing a dynamic
model of epidemic progression for the RL agent. This capability
allows the agent to account for individuals who are hospitalized,
enabling the dynamic modification of mobility control policies.
To explicitly capture causal dynamics, CausalGNN [21] intro-
duces a novel approach to causal modeling by leveraging causal
features Q𝑡=(𝑞𝑖,𝑡) ∈R𝑁×4, with𝑞𝑖,𝑡:𝑆𝑖(𝑡),𝐼𝑖(𝑡),𝑅𝑖(𝑡),𝐷𝑖(𝑡)
representing the cumulative number of individuals in each state of
the SIRD model. A causal encoder is then designed to transform
these causal features into node embeddings, operating as follows:
H𝑡
𝑐=tanh(Q𝑡W𝑡
𝑒+𝑏𝑡
𝑒)∈R𝑁×𝐷, (13)
where W𝑡𝑒∈R4×𝐷and𝑏𝑡𝑒∈R𝐷denote model parameters, and
these causal features are intended to be concatenated with other
node embeddings. The spatial GNN architecture also infers the SIRD
rates𝛽𝑖(𝑡),𝛾𝑖(𝑡),𝜌𝑖(𝑡)by providing P𝑡=(𝑝𝑖,𝑡)∈R𝑁×3, which are
subsequently utilized for SIRD model updates.
5 Future Work
While many challenges have been addressed in the application of
GNNs within epidemic modeling, this field continues to confront
various difficulties unexplored. This section will discuss these issues
and suggest directions for future research.
Epidemic at Scales. Multi-scale data are crucial in epidemiology as
they offer comprehensive insights into both intra-region and inter-
region relationships . Presently, several studies have acknowledged
this importance and initiated the integration of multi-scale data
into their frameworks [83, 127, 128, 70]. Although these efforts
have yielded models capable of accommodating multi-scale data,
existing approaches are limited to processing only two predefined
scales, such as county-level and state-level data. Thus, there is
growing anticipation for the development of novel models capable
of incorporating data across multiple dynamic scales and adaptable
to diverse epidemiological tasks. Meanwhile, scalability must also be
considered for numerous reasons: (1) A smaller granularity results
in the expansion of graph data. (2) Some tasks require real-time
processing [127]. While the number of countries or provinces can be
small, the graph for individuals or other necessary parts in epidemic
models can be extremely large, e.g., contact information graphs in
metropolises, which could make the current methods very time-
consuming. Moreover, the use of multi-scale data and the demands
for real-time processing make the problem even harder.
Cross-Modality in Epidemiology. The integration of multi-modal
data in epidemiological tasks offers a powerful approach for learn-
ing disease transmission dynamics, improving predictive accuracy,
enabling early intervention, and fostering interdisciplinary collab-
oration to address public health challenges more effectively. Data
from different modalities can not only serve as augmentations for
each other but also compensate for noise from single-modality
data. In recent years, some works have successfully incorporated
multi-modality in GNNs. Although GNNs are very suitable for in-
formation aggregation and handling multi-modality data, there has
not been much work exploring the multi-modality of GNNs in anepidemiology setting. Some related works [129, 46] have utilized un-
structured data like textual or image data to construct node features.
However, there is no cross-modality in terms of node features.
Epidemic Diffusion Process. The diffusion process, the key com-
ponent in epidemiological tasks, can be both spatial and temporal.
All GNN-based methods discussed above involve information aggre-
gation at one or several time points in a discrete manner. However,
in the real world, disease spreading is a continuous process, which
is incompatible with current methods. To address this problem,
Continuous GNNs [130, 131, 132], inspired by Neural ODE [133],
can be applied to model the continuous spreading process. Another
challenge arises from the temporal nature of disease transmission
and infection processes, which can occur asynchronously. The
work [64] considers different time-space effects and models the ef-
fects using the attention mechanism. Yet, it is still done in a discrete
manner, creating gaps in the real-world transmission process.
Interventions for Epidemics. In epidemiology, control measures
are vital for controlling disease spread and safeguarding public
health. They include intervention strategies like vaccination, quar-
antine, and public health education to limit transmission and mini-
mize outbreaks, ultimately saving lives and reducing the burden
on healthcare systems [134, 135, 136]. Among the methods men-
tioned in this paper, most of the research incorporates interven-
tion strategy in agent-based models [58, 91, 27] or other neural
models [93]. Generally, the interventions in these methods include
deleting nodes, altering nodes, and altering edge weights. However,
each method only includes one type of intervention, either node-
level or edge-level. In practice, however, interventions can happen
at different graph levels and also at different scales. To better model
the real situation, multi-level interventions need to be introduced.
Generating Explainable Predictions. Epidemic modeling seeks
not just accurate forecasts but also interpretability, crucial for mak-
ing informed decisions based on model predictions. Interpretability
allows for understanding disease dynamics, identifying risk factors,
and assessing uncertainty. Despite its importance, neural models
have often overlooked interpretability, with hybrid models depend-
ing on mechanistic models for explanations. However, recent efforts
to enhance GNN interpretability [137, 138, 139] could prove valu-
able in epidemiology, suggesting a growing recognition of the need
for models that can explain their predictions in this critical field.
6 Conclusion
In this survey, we offer a comprehensive overview of Graph Neural
Networks in epidemic modeling. First, we introduce the funda-
mental concepts relevant to both GNNs and epidemic modeling.
Following this, we propose detailed and organized taxonomies for
existing epidemiological tasks, datasets, and graph construction. In
terms of methodologies, we have systematically categorized the lit-
erature into two primary groups: Neural Models and Hybrid Models,
thoroughly reviewing the characteristics of current work in each
category. Finally, we identify and discuss some of the persistent
challenges, providing insightful directions for future research. The
primary goal of this survey is to promote a more seamless integra-
tion of GNNs into epidemiology, motivating both epidemiologists
and data scientists to delve into this rapidly advancing area.
