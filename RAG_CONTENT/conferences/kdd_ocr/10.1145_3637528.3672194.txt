ABSTRACT  
The data science ecosystem encompasses data fairness, statistical, 
ML and AI methods and tools, interpretable data analysis and 
results, and trustworthy decision -making. Rapid advancements in 
AI have revolutionized data utilization and enabled machines to 
learn from data more effectively. Statistics, as the science of learning 
from data while accounting for uncertainty, plays a pivotal role in 
addressing complex real -world problems and facilitating 
trustworthy decision -making. In this talk, I will discuss t he 
challenges and opportunities involved in building an end -to-end 
scalable  and interpretable data science ecosystem using the analysis 
of  whole genome sequencing studies and biobanks that integrates 
statistics, ML/AI, and genomic and health science as a n example. 
Biobanks collect whole genome data, electronic health records and 
epidemiological data. I will illustrate key points using the analysis 
of multi -ancestry whole genome sequencing studies and biobanks 
by discussing a few scalable and interpretable  statistical and ML/AI 
methods, tools and data science resources.  
Specifically, first, data fairness and diversity is a critical pillar of a 
trustworthy data science ecosystem. About 85+% of genome wide 
association study samples in the last 15 years are European, 
resulting in disparity in genetic research. I will discuss  the 
community effort on improving diversity in genetic studies in the 
last 10 years.  I will present trans -ancestry polygenic risk scores 
(PRS) using millions of common genetic variants across the genome 
by leveraging large GWAS sample sizes of European a nd smaller 
sample sizes of under -represented populations for predicting 
disease risk using transfer learning and genetic association 
summary statistics.  The performance of deep learning methods for 
PRS will also be discussed. Second, scalability in cloud platforms is 
critical for large scale affordable analysis for multi -ancestry 
biobanks and whole genome studies. I will discuss improving 
scalability in cloud -computing using interpretable sparsity via 
FastSparseGRM.  To build an interpretable and powerful end -to-end ecosystem of 
rare variant analysis of large  scale whole genome sequencing 
studies and biobanks, I will first introduce FAVOR, a multi -faceted 
variant functional annotation database and portal of all possible 9 
billions of variants across the whole genome. I will discuss FAVOR -
GPT, a LLM interface of  the FAVOR functional annotation database 
to improve user experience for navigating FAVOR and performing 
variant functional annotation query and variant functiona l 
summary statistics calculations. I will also discuss FAVORannotator 
which can be used to functionally annotate any whole genome 
sequencing studies. I will also discuss STAAR and STAAR and 
STAARpipeline, the WGS rare variant analysis pipeline that boosts 
the power of WGS rare variant association analysis by  dynamically 
incorporating multi -faceted variant functional annotations. 
Extension of incorporating single -cell data in WGS analysis will 
also be discussed. I will also discuss ensemble methods that  im prove 
the power of rare variant association tests.  
Cloud -deployment of these resources and tools in several 
ecosystems will be presented, such as RAP for the UK biobank, 
AnVIL for the NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program and All of Us, 
and BioData Catalyst for the  NHLBI Trans -omics Precision Medine 
Program (TO PMed).  This talk aims to ignite proactive and thought -
provoking discussions, foster collaboration, and cultivate open -
minded approaches to advance scientific discovery.

 BIOGRAPHY  
Xihong Lin is Professor and 
former Chair of Biostatistics 
and Coordinating Director 
of the Program in 
Quantitative Genomics at 
Harvard School of Public 
Health, and Professor of 
Statistics at Harvard 
University. Dr. Lin works on 
the development and 
applicat ion of statistical and 
machine learning methods for analysis of big and complex 
genomic and health data, such as large -scale whole genome 
sequencing (WGS) studies and multi -ethnic biobanks, Electronic 
Health Records, and whole genome variant functional 
annotations. The methods and tools her lab have  developed have 
been widely used in analyzing WGS and biobank data, including 
the Trans -Omics Precision Medicine Program (TOPMed) of the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the Genome 
Sequencing Program of the National Human Genome Research 
Institute (NHGRI), the UK biobank, and the NIH All of Us 
Program.   Dr. Lin was elected to the US National Academy of 
Medicine in 2018 and the US National Academy of Sciences in 
2023. She has received the 2002 Mor timer Spiegelman Award from 
the American Public Health Association, the 2006 Presidents’ 
Award from the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies 
(COPSS) , the 2017 COPSS FN David Award, the 2022 National 
Institute of Statistical Sciences Sacks Award for Outstanding 
Cross -Disciplinary Research, and  the 2022 Zelen Leadership in Statistical Science Award.  She is an 
elected fellow of American Statistical Association, Institute of 
Mathematical Statistics, and International Statistical Institute. Dr. 
Lin’s research has been supported by the MERIT Award (2007 -
