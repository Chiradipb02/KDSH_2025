ABSTRACT
Recent advanced AI technologies, especially large language mod-
els (LLMs) like GPTs, have significantly advanced the field of data
mining and led to the development of various LLM-based appli-
cations. AI for education (AI4EDU) is a vibrant multi-disciplinary
field of data mining, machine learning, and education, with in-
creasing importance and extraordinary potential. In this field, LLM
and adaptive learning-based models can be utilized as interfaces in
human-in-the-loop education systems, where the model serves as a
mediator among the teacher, students, and machine capabilities, in-
cluding its own. This perspective has several benefits, including the
ability to personalize interactions, allow unprecedented flexibility
and adaptivity for human-AI collaboration and improve the user
experience. However, several challenges still exist, including the
need for more robust and efficient algorithms, designing effective
user interfaces, and ensuring ethical considerations are addressed.
This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners
from academia and industry to explore cutting-edge AI technolo-
gies for personalized education, especially the potential of LLMs
and adaptive learning technologies.

1 INTRODUCTION
Following the success of the previous multiple AI4EDU workshops,
which were co-organized by our co-organizers, we are looking for-
ward to hosting the new AI4EDU workshop in KDD 2024. Different
from those previous workshops, the AI4EDU workshop at KDD
2024 will (1) provide a platform for both academia and industrial
researchers from different fields, e.g., data mining, machine learn-
ing, artificial intelligence, education, etc, to exchange ideas and
promote collaborations, and (2) focus on new emerging LLMs and
adaptive learning in education. Specifically, this workshop aims
to explore cutting-edge LLMs and adaptive learning technologies
for personalized education. The objectives of the workshop are
to: 1) Review the current state-of-the-art in LLM-based systems
and their applications in education. 2) Discuss the state-of-the-art
technologies of adaptive learning and mining that tailor education
to the individual needs, learning styles, proficiency levels, and prob-
lem areas of each student, for personalized learning experience.
3) Identify challenges and opportunities in using LLMs as both
communication and collaboration interfaces in adaptive learning
systems, educational games and intelligent educational assistants. 4)
Explore ethical considerations and standardization issues in the use
of LLMs. 5) Introduce and design new approaches such as prompt
engineering, local fine tuning, integrated reasoning, and delegation
framework for dialog-based systems that not only generate content
but also shape the behavior of the system.

2 TOPICS OF INTEREST
This workshop encourages submissions of innovative solutions
for a broad range of AI for Education problems. Topics of interest
include but are not limited to the following:
•Mining multimodal data for comprehensive learning analyt-
ics in LLM-aided education.
•Challenges and opportunities in integrating LLMs with ex-
isting adaptive learning systems.
•Adaptive learning and mining systems and their applications
in educational settings.
•Predictive modeling in education using LLMs for student
success and retention.
•The potential of LLMs in education from both the theoretical
and practical angles.
•Ethical considerations in the use of LLMs as interfaces in
educational settings, especially with AI standards committee.
•Frameworks for standardization and benchmarking of LLMs
in educational technology.
•Data-driven approaches to curriculum development using
LLM insights.
•Data-driven approaches to curriculum development using
LLM insights.
•LLMs role in automated assessment and real-time feedback
for students.
•The future of LLMs in education: trends, potentials, and
unforeseen consequences.
3PAPER SUBMISSION AND REVIEW PROCESS
We invite high-quality paper submissions of theoretical and experi-
mental nature on the broad AI4EDU topics. The workshop solicits
4-7 pages double-blind paper submissions from participants. Sub-
missions of the following flavors will be sought: (1) research ideas,
(2) case studies (or deployed projects), (3) review papers, (4) best
practice papers, and (5) lessons learned. All submissions will be
peer-reviewed. Some will be selected for spotlight talks, and some
for the poster session.
Each submitted paper will be evaluated by at least two review-
ers, using the same criteria as SIGKDD Research Track papers:
novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity. As with
Research Track papers, we will consider sufficiently innovative
application-oriented papers, in addition to theoretical and method-
ological contributions. The program committee members and other
researchers recommended by the program committee members will
review the papers. Additional reviews may be solicited if the two
reviews are not conclusive. Only papers that are deemed to be sat-
isfactorily novel and technically sound by the program committee
will be accepted.
4 WORKSHOP FORMAT
The workshop will be held in person and will include interactive
sessions and online resources to support ongoing collaboration. The
workshop will consist of paper presentations, panel discussions,
and group activities to facilitate the exchange of ideas and promote
collaborative learning as follows:
•Paper Presentations: 20 minutes for each paper.•Invited Talks: We intend to have 5-7 speakers to present their
expert insights.
•Panel Discussions: Panel discussion sessions are intended to
explore various heated topics related to the implementation
of AI in education, ongoing initiatives, and projects.
•Poster Sessions: Optional for papers that could not fit into
the main session - Allow breakout rooms.
5 INTENDED AUDIENCE
The workshop is intended for researchers and practitioners in the
areas of data mining, NLP, HCI, machine learning, educational
technology, and other related fields. Participants will benefit from
the opportunity to learn about the latest research and developments
in the use of LLMs and adaptive learning systems, as well as engage
in a collaborative design and prototyping activity.
6 EXPECTED OUTCOMES
The expected outcomes of the workshop include a better under-
standing of the potential of LLMs and adaptive learning for person-
alized education systems, a review of the current state-of-the-art,
identification of challenges and opportunities, and recommenda-
tions for future research and practice. Additionally, we expect to
identify potential collaborations and partnerships that can lead
to the development of more robust LLMs and adaptive learning
systems, as well as prototype designs for new LLM-based systems
in educational settings.
