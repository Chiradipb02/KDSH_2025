ABSTRACT
Sepsis is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality in the USA. Early
sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve
the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually
trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while
missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (espe-
cially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes
a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty
for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing
values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with
estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation
results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which
have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction
or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such
propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and
then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the
propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk pa-
tients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose
a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively
recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables.
We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data
(i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in
The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The
experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is domi-
nant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed
algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Fi-
nally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction
and active sensing based on our pre-trained models. Clinicians
and potential sepsis patients can benefit from the system in early
prediction and diagnosis of sepsis.

1 INTRODUCTION
Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response
to infection, contributes to up to half of all hospital deaths and
is associated with more than $24 billion in annual costs in the
United States [ 13]. Existing studies [ 14] have shown that a sepsis
patient may benefit from a 4% higher chance of survival if they
are diagnosed 1 hour earlier, so developing an early sepsis onset
prediction system can significantly improve clinical outcomes.
Existing machine-learning-based predictive models [ 7,10,21,38]
are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing informa-
tion, while missing values widely exist in emergency department
(ED) and emergency medical services (EMS) settings, which would
cause most existing sepsis prediction models to suffer from perfor-
mance decline and high uncertainty. In addition, existing studies
[22,30] have shown that for sepsis cases, most patients have already
progressed into sepsis before the admissions to hospitals or during
the first hours of admissions. Thus it is critical to develop accurate
sepsis prediction systems that can handle high missing-rate settings
(e.g., cold-start setting with only several limited vital signs).
A common method to handle missing variables is imputation, in
which missing values are replaced by estimates from the observed
data. To use the existing methods, we will need data imputations,
which come with a new problem for the downstream sepsis predic-
tion tasks: the uncertainty of imputation results can propagate to
the sepsis prediction models. Especially for deep learning models, a
small perturbation in the input variables might cause a significant

change in the predicted risk [ 15,20]. When the prediction models
are sensitive to the highly uncertain input (i.e., imputed variable),
the generated outputs are not reliable, so it is critical to quantify and
reduce such kind of uncertainty. However, unlike epistemic uncer-
tainty [ 28] and aleatory uncertainty [ 4], the propagated uncertainty
from the (imputed) input has not been investigated.
In this study, we develop an early sepsis prediction system Sep-
sisLab that can quantify and reduce such kind of propagated un-
certainty from missing value and imputation. Figure 1 displays the
workflow of SepsisLab system. Given a patient’s data with limited
observations, we first adopt an imputation model to estimate the
distribution (i.e., mean and standard deviation) of missing values.
The standard deviation can be treated as the uncertainty of the
imputed results. Then we propose a time-aware sepsis prediction
model to predict whether the patients will suffer from sepsis in the
coming hours. The prediction model can generate sepsis risk and
uncertainty simultaneously. Given the estimated uncertainty, we
further propose a robust active sensing algorithm to recommend
clinicians observe the most informative lab test items that can max-
imally reduce the uncertainty for the potential high-risk patients.
The active sensing module can significantly improve downstream
sepsis prediction performance by providing more accurate observa-
tion and reducing the propagated uncertainty.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models, we
conduct experiments on real-world clinical datasets (including
two publicly available datasets MIMIC-III [ 9] and AmsterdamUM-
Cdb [ 29], and proprietary data from The Ohio State University
Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC)). Experimental results show
that the developed system can successfully work on both high-
and low-missing-rate settings and achieve state-of-the-art sepsis
prediction performance. Finally, we develop a SepsisLab system for
deployment to integrate into clinicians’ workflow, which paves the
way for human-AI collaboration and early intervention for sepsis
management.
We summarize our contributions as follows:●We introduce propagated uncertainty to deep learning mod-
els, a new source of uncertainty different from widely studied
aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty
●We adopt uncertainty propagation to successfully qualify
the propagated uncertainty, and the experimental results
demonstrate the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the
beginning of patients’ admissions to hospital.
●We propose a new active sensing framework RAS, which
could effectively select variables to observe, and the experi-
ments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed propa-
gated uncertainty qualification method.
●We design an interactive system SepsisLab1to make clin-
icians able to easily use and effectively interact with the
models.
2 RELATED WORK
In this section, we briefly review the existing studies related to sepsis
prediction systems, uncertainty qualification and active sensing.
2.1 Sepsis Prediction Systems
Sepsis is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that is the leading
cause of mortality in hospital intensive care units (ICUs) [ 24,33].
Early prediction and diagnosis may allow for timely treatment
and lead to more targeted clinical interventions. Screening tools
have been used clinically to recognize sepsis, including qSOFA
[25], MEWS [ 27], NEWS [ 26], and SIRS [ 3]. However, those tools
were designed to screen existing symptoms as opposed to explicitly
early predicting sepsis before its onset, and their efficacy in sepsis
diagnosis is limited. With recent advances, deep learning methods
have shown great potential for accurate sepsis prediction [ 7,10,21,
38]. Although the methods achieved superior performance, they
face a critical limitation: the models need to take the complete
observation of a list of variables (including vital signs and lab tests),
while lots of variables are missing in real-world data (especially in
the first hours of admissions). Existing studies [ 7,10,38] usually
impute the missing values before the prediction, which raises a
new problem that the sepsis prediction models will heavily rely on
the imputation methods. The imputation uncertainty would also be
propagated to downstream prediction models. Thus it is necessary
to quantify the propagated uncertainty, especially for high-stakes
sepsis prediction tasks.
2.2 Uncertainty Qualification
Understanding what a model does not know is a critical part of
many machine learning systems. Despite the superior performance
deep learning models have achieved in various domain, they are usu-
ally over-confident about the predictions, which could limit their
applications to real-world risk-sensitive settings (e.g., in health-
care). Uncertainty quantification methods play a pivotal role in
reducing the impact of uncertainties during both optimization and
decision making processes [ 1]. Existing uncertainty qualification
work [ 4,6,11,23] has widely studied epistemic uncertainty and

aleatoric uncertainty. However, most existing uncertainty quali-
fication studies ignore an important uncertainty source: the un-
certainty propagated from the uncertainty of input (e.g., widely
existing missing values). In this study, we aim to investigate and
reduce the propagated uncertainty.
2.3 Active Sensing
Active sensing aims to improve the target tasks’ performance by
actively selecting most informative variables with the minimal cost.
Yu et. al [ 37] propose to select the informative variables based on
mutual information and predictive variance. However, the model
is based on Bayesian co-training framework, the prediction ability
of which is not as good as deep neural networks when handling
large-scale time serial data. Yoon et. al [ 36] attempt to solve the
active sensing problem by proposing an RNN-based model (i.e.,
Deep Sensing). The Deep Sensing framework involves learning
3 different networks: an interpolation network, a prediction net-
work and an error estimation network. Each network is separately
optimized for its own objective and then combined together after
training to be used for active sensing. Jarrett et. al [ 8] propose an
Inverse Active Sensing (IAS) to require negotiating (subjective)
trade-off between accuracy, speediness, and cost of information.
Yoon et. al [ 35] propose an RL-based framework (Active Sensing
using Actor-Critic models, ASAC) to directly optimize the predic-
tive power after active sensing. Although the methods achieved
superior performance in the target prediction tasks, they failed to
measure the uncertainty of both missing values and model output
risks, which limit their application in high-stakes clinical settings.In this study, we aim to develop an accurate sepsis prediction
system with propagated uncertainty quantification and incorporate
active sensing algorithms to reduce the propagated uncertainty.
3 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we present the proposed sepsis prediction system
SepsisLab, including a missing value imputation model, an early
sepsis prediction model, and an active sensing algorithm.
3.1 Notation and Problem Statement
In this study, we aim to predict sepsis onset with limited clinical
variables observed. We consider the following setup. A patient has
a sequence of clinical variables (i.e., lab test data and vital sign
data) with timestamps. Let 𝑍∈ 𝑅∪∗ 𝑛×𝑘denote the observa-
tions of variables, where ∗represents missing values, 𝑛denotes the
number of collections of observations and 𝑘denotes the number
of unique clinical variables. 𝑇∈𝑅𝑛denotes the observation times-
tamps.𝑌∈ 0,1 𝑛denotes the ground truth of whether the patient
will progress to sepsis in the coming hours. Following [ 10,38], we
set the prediction window as 4 hours. Due to the existence of miss-
ing values, we impute the missing values first and use 𝑋∈𝑅𝑛×𝑘to
denote the imputed results.
Given a loss function ℒand a distribution over pairs ( 𝑋, Y), the
goal is to find a function 𝑓that minimize the expected loss:
𝑓∗=arg min
𝑓𝐸(︀ℒ{︃𝑓{︃𝑋}︃,𝑌}︃⌋︀ (1)
We list the important notations in Table 1.

3.2 Missing Value Imputation
We assume the missing values follow the Gaussian distributions
and impute the missing values by estimating the distribution of
variables (i.e., the mean and covariance). Figure 2(A) shows the
framework of our imputation model.
Following [ 31], we first use mean-imputation to preprocess the
observational data 𝑍and send the embedding of 𝑍to LSTM to
model the patient’s health states.

values𝑍𝑖, observation time 𝑇𝑖. We use a fully connected layer to
embed the observed variable in the collection:

where (︀●;●⌋︀denotes concatenation operation. 𝑤𝑒∈𝑅{︃𝑘+2𝑑}︃×𝑑and
𝑏𝑒∈𝑅𝑑are learnable variables. 𝑒𝑡
𝑖∈𝑅2𝑑denotes the time embed-
ding and is computed as follows:

𝑖,𝑑+𝑗=𝑐𝑜𝑠{︃𝑇𝑖∗𝑗
𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥∗𝑑}︃, (3)
where 0≤𝑗<𝑑, and𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 denotes the max value of 𝑇.
Time-aware LSTM encoder. Given the embedding vectors
(︀𝑒1,𝑒2,...,𝑒𝑛⌋︀, we use LSTM to model the patients’ states:
𝑠1,𝑠2,...,𝑠𝑇=𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 {︃𝑒1,𝑒2,...,𝑒𝑛}︃ (4)
Missing value distribution estimation. A fully connected
layers is used to generate the parameters of the missing value
distribution:
𝜇𝑖=𝑤𝜇𝑠𝑖+𝑏𝜇, 𝜎𝑖=𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈 {︃𝑤𝜎𝑠𝑖+𝑏𝜎}︃, (5)
where𝑤𝜇,𝑤𝜎∈𝑅𝑘and𝑏𝜇,𝑏𝜎∈𝑅are learnable variables.We train the imputation model with the mean square error loss
function:

∑
𝑖=1𝑘
∑
𝑗=1𝑀𝑖,𝑗{︃𝜇𝑖,𝑗−𝑍𝑖,𝑗}︃2, (6)
where𝑀∈ 0,1 𝑛×𝑘denotes the indices of masked variables. 𝑀𝑖,𝑗
is 1 if the𝑗𝑡ℎvariable in𝑖𝑡ℎcollection is observed and masked;
otherwise, 0. Replacing the missed values ∗with the estimates 𝜇,
the observed variables 𝑍become𝑋∈𝑅𝑇×𝑛.
After the imputation model is well-trained with Equation 6, we
further learn to estimate the standard deviation 𝜎by finetuning 𝑤𝜎
and𝑏𝜎and fixing other parameters. We minimize the following
loglikelihood loss:
ℒ𝜎{︃𝑍,𝑀,𝜇,𝜎 }︃=𝑛

3.3 Sepsis Prediction Model
With the imputed results to replace the missing values, we con-
tinue to predict whether the patients will suffer from sepsis in the
coming hours. The framework of sepsis prediction model is shown
in Figure 2(B).
Similar to Equation 8 in the imputation model, we use the same
embedding layers in the imputation model.

𝑖=𝑤𝑒(︀𝑋𝑖;𝑒𝑡

where the time embedding 𝑒𝑡

Then we use LSTM [ 5] to model the patient’s health states. A
fully connected layer and a Sigmoid layer is followed to generate
the sepsis risks:
𝑝𝑖=𝑆𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑑 {︃𝑤𝑠ℎ𝑖+𝑏𝑠}︃,where𝑡=1,2,...,𝑇 (9)

where𝑤𝑠∈𝑅𝑑and𝑏𝑠∈𝑅are learnable parameters.

3.4 Sources of Uncertainty
When applying deep learning methods to high-stakes sepsis pre-
diction tasks, the lack of uncertainty quantification will make the
models less reliable. In this subsection, we investigate two main
sources of uncertainty.
Uncertainty from the model parameters. Existing uncer-
tainty qualification work [ 4,6,11,23] has widely studied epistemic
uncertainty, which accounts for uncertainty in the model parame-
ters, especially for the huge amount of parameters in deep learning
models. Following [ 11], we use drop-out during the test phase and
run the inference many times to quantify such kind of uncertainty.
Uncertainty from missing values. Superior risk prediction
models in the healthcare domain heavily rely on high-quality com-
plete input. However, missing values (e.g., vital signs and lab test
results) widely exist in real-world clinical settings. Most risk pre-
diction methods [ 7,10,21,38] first impute the missing values and
then make predictions based on the imputed values. The accuracy
6161SepsisLab: Early Sepsis Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification and Active Sensing KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
of the imputation methods can directly affect the performance of
the predicted sepsis risks. The uncertainty from the imputation
results can be directly propagated to downstream sepsis prediction
models.
3.5 Uncertainty Definition
We use the variance of prediction models’ output to define the two
kinds of uncertainty mentioned above. Patients’ data 𝑋contains a
sequence of collections of variables. We can use all the observations
until the current collections to make predictions. When applying
active sensing algorithms to reduce the propagated uncertainty
with additional observations, we can only request the variables in
the current collection.
In the active sensing task, we only focus on the uncertainty
related to the latest collection. In the following subsections, for
simplicity, at a given time 𝑇𝑖, we use𝑥to represent the 𝑖𝑡ℎobser-
vation (i.e., 𝑋𝑖), and use𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥}︃rather than 𝑓𝑤{︃𝑋}︃to denote the
predicted risk, where 𝑤means all the learnable parameters in the
sepsis prediction model.
We assume the input variables 𝑥∈𝑅𝑘and model parameters 𝑤
follow Gaussian distributions 𝒩{︃𝜇𝑥,𝜎𝑥}︃and𝒩{︃𝜇𝑤,𝜎𝑤}︃.𝜇𝑥∈𝑅𝑘
and𝜎𝑥∈𝑅𝑘can be estimated with Equation 5. Let 𝑦denote the
sepsis prediction label for the patient at current time.
Following existing studies [ 11], we define the uncertainty of
predicted risk as the variance of model outcomes:
𝑈=∫𝑤∫𝑥{︃𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥}︃−𝜇𝑦}︃2𝜌{︃𝑥}︃𝑑𝑥𝜌{︃𝑤}︃𝑑𝑤=𝑈𝑥+𝑈𝑤 (12)
where𝑈𝑥=∫𝑤∫𝑥{︃𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥}︃−𝜇𝑦𝑤}︃2𝜌{︃𝑥}︃𝑑𝑥𝜌{︃𝑤}︃𝑑𝑤,
𝑈𝑤=∫𝑤{︃𝜇𝑦𝑤−𝜇𝑦}︃2𝜌{︃𝑤}︃𝑑𝑤,
𝜇𝑦𝑤=∫𝑥𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥}︃𝜌{︃𝑥}︃𝑑𝑥,
𝜇𝑦=∫𝑤∫𝑥𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥}︃𝜌{︃𝑥}︃𝜌{︃𝑤}︃𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑤,
where𝜌{︃●}︃denotes the density function.
We split the uncertainty into two terms. The second term 𝑈𝑤is
caused by the model uncertainty from the model parameters, so we
just focus on the first term 𝑈𝑥when actively selecting unobserved
variables.
When the model parameter 𝑤is fixed, we can estimate the prop-
agated uncertainty as:
𝑈{︃𝑤}︃
𝑥=∫𝑥{︃𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥}︃−𝜇𝑦𝑤}︃2𝜌{︃𝑥}︃𝑑𝑥 (13)
3.6 Propagated Uncertainty Quantification
3.6.1 Propagated Uncertainty for Linear Target Prediction. When
the sepsis risk prediction function is a linear function, 𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥}︃=
∑𝑗𝑤𝑗𝑥𝑗, following [ 12], we compute the uncertainty in Equation 13
as:
𝑈{︃𝑤}︃
𝑥=∑

𝑖𝜎2
𝑥𝑖+∑
𝑖∑
𝑗≠𝑖𝑤𝑖𝑤𝑗𝜌𝑖𝑗𝜎𝑥𝑖𝜎𝑥𝑗, (14)
where𝜌𝑖𝑗denotes the correlation between 𝑖𝑡ℎand𝑗𝑡ℎvariable. It
is easy to compute the propagated uncertainty for linear function
based on Equation 14 for linear function. The calculation detailsAlgorithm 1 Adversarial Training

3.6.2 Propagated Uncertainty for Non-Linear Target Prediction. For
the non-linear sepsis prediction function, we use the Taylor expan-
sion as approximate function:
˜𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥+𝛿}︃=𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥}︃+𝛿𝑇∇𝑥𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥}︃ (16)
We can use the uncertain propagation in Equation 14 as the ap-
proximation of the uncertainty of non-linear function 𝑓𝑤. However,
the propagated uncertainty estimation for non-linear functions are
biased on account of using a truncated series expansion. The extent
of this bias depends on the nature of the function.
The absolute difference between the two values ˜𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥+𝛿}︃and
𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥+𝛿}︃is:
𝑔{︃𝛿,𝑥}︃=⋃︀𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥+𝛿}︃−𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥}︃+𝛿𝑇∇𝑥𝑓𝑤{︃𝑥}︃⋃︀ (17)
When𝑔{︃𝛿,𝑥}︃is small enough in the neighborhood near 𝜇𝑥(i.e.,
𝑓𝑤is locally linear), the propagated uncertainty in Equation 14 is
still accurate and able to guide the active sensing.
3.7 Robust Active Sensing
3.7.1 Adversarial Training for Local Linearity. Existing studies [ 18,
19] have shown that adversarial training can encourage the local
linearity of the learned functions. In this study, we adopt adversarial
training to make the target prediction function locally linear in a
neighborhood near the mean value of input 𝑥.

The risk prediction model is trained with a weighted sum of

where 0<𝛼<1is a hyper-parameter.

We consider the quantity:

to be a measure of how linear the surface is within a neighbor-
hood near𝑥. We call this quantity the local linearity measure. The
missing variables follow Gaussian distribution, so 𝛿lies within two
standard deviations with more than probability 95%. The uncer-
tainty estimation error would be less than 𝛾{︃𝜎𝑥,𝑥}︃with probability
more than 95%.
Algorithm 1 describes the training process of the sepsis predic-
tion model.

diction outcome is defined as:

4 EXPERIMENT SETUP
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we con-
ducted experiments on real-world datasets.
4.1 Datasets
Datasets. We validate our system on two publicly available datasets
( MIMIC-III2and AmsterdamUMCdb3) and one proprietary dataset
extracted from OSUWMC4. We first extracted all the sepsis patients
with sepsis-3 criteria [ 24] in the datasets. For each sepsis patient,
we select 1 control patient with the same demographics (i.e., age
and gender). We extracted 26 vital signs and lab tests from the
datasets. A detailed list of clinical variables can be found in supple-
mentary materials. The statistics of the three datasets are displayed
in Table 2.
Variables Used for Sepsis Prediction. Following [ 33], we use
following variables to model sepsis patients’ health states: heart rate,
Respratory, Temperature, Spo2, SysBP, DiasBP, MeanBP, Glucose,

The first 8 variables are immediately available vital signs. The
missing rates of the variables can be found in Table 7 in subsec-
tion A.2.
4.2 Setup
We mimic the cold-start environment where only vital signs are
immediately available, while all the lab tests can be observed after
the assignment. Figure 3 displays the setting of the experiments.
After the patients arrive at the hospital, we start to predict whether
the patients will suffer from sepsis in 4 hours. We run the prediction
process hourly until the patients have been diagnosed with sepsis
or discharged. When the model’s output has a high uncertainty
due to the limited observations, the active sensing algorithms can
select the missing lab tests to observe. Based on the lab testing turn-
around times policy of OSUWMC, most lab results will be available
in less than 30~60 min5(or even sooner for sepsis patients with
high priority), so the observation results for the selected lab items
can be used in the same hour to update the predicted sepsis risk.
Note that when active sensing algorithms select some variables that
are not collected at the corresponding time, we use the estimates
from other observed variables as the active observation results.
4.3 Methods for Comparison
We compare the proposed model with following methods:
●Random sensing: We randomly select the masked values to
observe for random sensing.
●Active sensing MI [37]: The method selects the most informa-
tive variables based on the mutual information.

●Virtual adversarial training (VAT) [17]: VAT proposes to make
the learned function locally linear with local a smoothness reg-
ularization method. Then we use the same variable selection
method as ours to select missing values.
●Monte Carlo sampling: Existing studies [ 11] use Monte-Carlo
dropout to measure the epistemic uncertainty. Similarly, we use
Monte-Carlo sampling to estimate the propagated uncertainty
by sampling the values of the unobserved variables based on
the Gaussian distribution and select the variable with maximal
variance in generated output, as Figure 2(C) shows.
●Robust active sensing (RAS): RAS is the proposed method.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the adversarial training, we
implement three versions of RAS. RAS is the main version. RAS𝐿
uses the linear constraint to make the learned function locally
linear. RAS𝑁means the model is only trained by minimizing the
classification loss in Equation 11 without any linearity constraint.
For fair comparison to the baselines, all active sensing algorithms
use the same deep-learning sepsis prediction model backbone. Our
previous works [ 33,38] have shown that LSTM can successfully
model the time series EHR data and achieve superior performance in
the sepsis prediction tasks, so we use LSTM as the model backbone.
Note that the proposed active sensing methods are generalizable to
various deep learning frameworks.
5 RESULTS
We now report the performance of SepsisLab in the three datasets.
We focus on answering the following research questions by our
experimental results:
●Q1: How does the model uncertainty affect the sepsis pre-
diction performance?
●Q2: How does the active sensing algorithm reduce the prop-
agated uncertainty?
●Q3: How does the active sensing algorithm improve the
sepsis prediction performance?
5.1 Q1: How does the model uncertainty affect
the sepsis prediction performance?
The existence of uncertainty makes AI models less reliable and
less accurate when applying the models to real-world high-stakes
scenarios. In this subsection, we aim to show how the model un-
certainty affects sepsis prediction performance by analyzing the
relation between uncertainty and prediction performance.
5.1.1 Prediction Performance over Uncertainty Scales. We compute
the uncertainty of the sepsis onset prediction model’s output with
Equation 12 and split the patients into 6 sets with different uncer-
tainty scales. Then we calculate the sepsis onset prediction perfor-
mance on AUROC inside each set. Figure 4 displays the model per-
formance over the different uncertainty scales in the three datasets.
We conducted experiments in two settings. In active sensing set-
ting, we compute the AUROC after active sensing algorithms are
used. In the observed data setting, we directly run the data in the
observed data (including all the recorded vital signs and lab tests)
and compute the AUROC. The results in both settings show that
when uncertainty is higher, the model performance becomes less

uncertainty.

accurate, so a good active sensing framework can improve the pre-
diction performance by reducing the uncertainty of the prediction
model’s output.
5.1.2 Uncertainty Scales over Time. We quantify the model uncer-
tainty at different times from admissions. Figure 5 displays the
average uncertainty scales.
Figure 5 shows that in the first 15 hours, propagated uncertainty
is dominant in sepsis onset risk prediction models. We speculate
the reason is that at the beginning most variables have not been
observed and the missing values cause the main uncertainty, which
is consistent with our clinical experts’ experience. With more vari-
ables collected, the propagated uncertainty decreases a lot after 15
hours of the admissions.
Because the missing variables can cause high uncertainty during
the first hours, it is critical to quantify the propagated uncertainty
when applying risk prediction models to high missing-rate settings.
5.2 Q2: How does the active sensing algorithm
reduce the propagated uncertainty?
Based on the estimated uncertainty, we propose active sensing
algorithms to further reduce the prediction uncertainty by recom-
mending clinicians collect more unobserved variables. We conduct
experiments to show whether uncertainty can be significantly re-
duced with minimal additional variables observed.

Figur
e 7: Inference time cost over times after admission.
5.2.1 Uncertainty with Different Active Sensing Ratio. Figure 6 dis-
plays the average uncertainties for sepsis prediction results with
different active sensing ratios. The results show that with more
missing variables observed, the uncertainty on the predicted sep-
sis risks are significantly reduced. Besides, all the versions of the
proposed RAS reduce more uncertainty than the baselines, which
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed active sensing algo-
rithms on uncertainty reduction.
5.2.2 Uncertainty Quantification Efficiency. We also investigate
the time cost for uncertainty quantification during the inference
phase. Figure 7 displays the inference time cost for uncertainty
quantification. The results show that RAS can achieve much less
time than the baselines, which makes the SepsisLab system work
more efficiently during the active sensing phase.
5.3 Q3: How does the active sensing algorithm
improve the sepsis prediction performance?
The goal of SepsisLab is to accurately predict the sepsis so as to
provide reliable decision-making support to clinicians. We conduct
experiments to show sepsis prediction performance improvement
with the active sensing algorithms.
5.3.1 Sepsis onset Prediction Results. Table 3 displays the risk pre-
diction performance with different active sensing ratios (i.e., 2%-8%).
With additional variables observed, all the methods can achieve
more accurate prediction performance for sepsis onset. Moreover,
all the active sensing algorithms outperform the random sensing
baseline with the same observation rate, which demonstrates that
active sensing can improve downstream tasks’ performance. Among
the active sensing algorithms, the proposed RAS achieved the best
performance with different active sensing ratios, which demon-
strate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
5.3.2 Ablation Study. We have three versions of the framework.
RAS𝑁directly uses the gradient to estimate propagated uncertainty.
RAS𝐿uses a linear regularization term to make the model locally
smooth, while RAS uses adversarial training. For RAS𝐿and RAS
versions, the additional terms change the loss functions. We conduct
experiments to show whether the additional terms can improve
model training. We train the three versions of models independently
and test them on all the observed data (without active sensing). As
Table 4 shows, RAS𝐿and RAS outperform RAS𝑁, which demon-
strates local linearity can further improve prediction performance.
With adversarial training, RAS can achieve better local linearity
than RAS𝐿and thus perform the best, which also explains why the
RAS outperforms better than Monte-Carlo sampling in Table 3 in
the active sensing.

list with sepsis risk prediction score. (B) The patient’s de-
mographics and the dashboard of the patient’s historical
observations. (C) Predicted sepsis risk score with uncertainty
range and recommended lab test items to observe.
We also conduct more experiments with different backbones
(e.g., RNN, GRU, FC) and display the performance in Table 6 in
subsection A.3. The experimental results show that the proposed
model can consistently improve the prediction performance for all
the backbones by recommending the most informative variables
for observation.
5.3.3 Hyper-parameter Optimization. The proposed RAS have four
important hyper-parameter: weight 𝛼in Equation 19, step size 𝑠𝑎𝑑𝑣,
step𝑛𝑎𝑑𝑣, learning rate 𝑙𝑟in Algorithm 1. We use grid-search to
find the best parameter (with active sensing ratio equal to 8%). Table
5 displays the searching space and the optimal values used in the
training process.
6 DEPLOYMENT
Based on the sepsis prediction model and active sensing algorithm,
we implement a system SepsisLab. Figure 8 and Figure 9 shows how
the system is deploed in the Epic EHR Systems6at OSUWMC.
SepsisLab starts to collect patients’ data after the patients arrive
hospital and automatically predicts sepsis risks hourly. Figure 8(A)
displays a list of patients with different sepsis risk prediction scores,
colored from no risk as Green, to medium risk as Yellow, to high
risk as Red. When picking a patient’s data, Figure 8(B) shows the pa-
tient’s demographics and the dashboard that includes the patient’s
vital signs, lab test results, and medical history, which are helpful
for clinicians to understand the patient’s health states. Figure 8(C)
shows the patient’s sepsis risk (solid line) and uncertainty range

importance to reduce the uncertainty of the sepsis future prediction.
The interactive process with our system is visualized in Figure 9.
This UI currently illustrates that a clinical expert is examining a
high-risk patient’s data who was admitted 4 hours ago. The Sep-
sisLab suggests the expert collect more lab results. The expert is
interacting with the visualization to see if Lactate and Creatinine
lab results were added, and how the sepsis prediction and its uncer-
tainty would change. The clinician can select a lab item (Figure 9(b))
or multiple lab items (Figure 9(c)) and see the expected influence
of the lab test result on the model uncertainty via a counterfactual
prediction. By comparing different combinations of the lab test
items, the clinician can obtain a better understanding of the model
and make the decision to order appropriate lab tests to collect the
actual item values, which then truly update the model’s prediction
trajectory and uncertainty range.
Note that we used OSUWMC data for our algorithm illustration.
All patients’ names and demographic info in this Figure 8 are ran-
domly generated for illustration purposes. Ongoing deployment
also includes recruit clinicians for usability evaluation to quantita-
tive and qualitatively measure clinical outcome and user satisfaction

7 CONCLUSION
In this work, we study a real-world problem that how to accu-
rately predict sepsis with limited variables available. Missing values
widely exist in clinical data and can cause inaccurate prediction and
high uncertainty for the sepsis prediction models. To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first work that studies the model uncertainty
caused by missing values. We define a new term propagated uncer-
tainty to describe the uncertainty, which is the downstream models’
uncertainty propagated from the uncertain input (i.e., imputation
results). We further propose uncertainty propagation methods to
quantify the propagated uncertainty. Based on the uncertainty quan-
tification, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to reduce
the uncertainty by actively recommending clinicians to observe
the most informative variables. The experimental results on real-
world datasets show that the introduced propagated uncertainty is
dominant at the beginning of patients’ admissions to the hospital
due to the very limited variables and the proposed active sensing
algorithm can significantly reduce the propagated uncertainty and
thus improve the sepsis prediction performance. Finally, we de-
sign a SepsisLab system for deployment to integrate into clinicians’
workflow, which paves the way for human-AI collaboration and
early intervention for sepsis management.

backbones
Our model is applicable to various models, including LSTM, GRU,
and fully-connected networks (FC). LSTM has shown superior per-
formance in modeling clinical time series data in multiple tasks,
including missing value imputation [ 32,34], clinical prediction
[16], and patient subtyping [ 2], so we choose LSTM as the model
backbone. We also conducted more experiments with different back-
bones as shown in Table 6. The experimental results show that the
proposed model can significantly improve the prediction perfor-
mance for all the backbones by recommending the most informative
variables for observation.
