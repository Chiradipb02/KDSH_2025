ABSTRACT
Financial trading is a crucial component of the markets, informed
by a multimodal information landscape encompassing news, prices,
and Kline charts, and encompasses diverse tasks such as quantita-
tive trading and high-frequency trading with various assets. While
advanced AI techniques like deep learning and reinforcement learn-
ing are extensively utilized in finance, their application in financial
trading tasks often faces challenges due to inadequate handling of
multimodal data and limited generalizability across various tasks.
To address these challenges, we present FinAgent1, a multimodal
foundational agent with tool augmentation for financial trading.
FinAgent ’s market intelligence module processes a diverse range
of data—numerical, textual, and visual—to accurately analyze the
financial market. Its unique dual-level reflection module not only
enables rapid adaptation to market dynamics but also incorpo-
rates a diversified memory retrieval system, enhancing the agent’s
ability to learn from historical data and improve decision-making
processes. The agent’s emphasis on reasoning for actions fosters

markets by enabling efficient trading. Rule-based trading systems
are rigid and struggle to adapt to market volatility, often resulting
in underperformance in evolving markets. Reinforcement learning-
based systems[ 2] demonstrate enhanced adaptability but encounter
substantial obstacles, such as the need for extensive training data
and the inexplainability of decision-making processes. Additionally,
they struggle with generalizing across diverse market conditions,
are sensitive to market noise, and often fail to integrate multi-
modal market intelligence like news and reports into their analysis.
The financial trading landscape demands more advanced machine-
learning methods to address complex market dynamics, seeking to
move beyond the limitations of rule-based and RL methods.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their
potential in a range of decision-making tasks when applied in AI
agents [ 28,35,43,57], marking a significant expansion beyond
natural language processing into more complex, task-specific func-
tions. This advancement includes the integration of memory and
planning modules, which enable these agents to adapt within dy-
namic environments, akin to human cognitive processes. This evo-
lution has been further pushed by the advent of multimodal LLMs
like GPT-4V [ 26], which enhances the capabilities of LLMs by pro-
cessing both textual and visual data. Moreover, the integration of
tool-augmented models like Toolformer [ 33] empowers LLMs to
utilize external tools, thus elevating their decision-making abilities
in complex scenarios. This combination of adaptability and en-
hanced processing capabilities offers new possibilities in fields such
as fintech, where nuanced analysis and adaptation are important.
LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in analyzing
and interpreting financial data, as evidenced by developments like
BloombergGPT [ 48], and FinGPT [ 50]. However, there is a natural
gap between QA tasks and sequential decision-making in trading.
Although FinMEM [ 56] is an LLM trading agent with a human-
aligned memory mechanism and character design, the full capa-
bilities of LLMs as comprehensive autonomous trading systems
remain underexplored, particularly in their ability to interpret mul-
timodal data and utilize diverse tools. The challenges in navigating
the complexities of financial markets are identified as follows:
•Ch1: Insufficient Multimodal Data Processing Ability. Pro-
cessing numerical, textual, and visual market intelligence data
significantly requires advanced analytical methods to extract key
insights and predict market trends.
•Ch2: Imprecise information retrieval. Mixing retrieval with
main tasks and relying on brief summaries causes imprecise
searches, introducing irrelevant data and reducing performance.
•Ch3: Adaptability in Rapidly Evolving Markets. Financial
trading requires the ability to quickly adapt to fluctuating market
conditions. Traditional methods often fall short, highlighting the
necessity for models capable of responding to real-time data and
adjusting strategies according to historical market trends.•Ch4: Integration of Domain Knowledge. Current models
often struggle to integrate established methods such as expert
guidance and advanced trading tools effectively, leading to a
decline in both the effectiveness and depth of market analysis.
•Ch5. Reasoning for Actions. The black-box nature of many so-
phisticated AI models, directly giving results of decisions without
providing the reasoning process.
To address the challenges of adapting the multimodal LLMs
to the dynamic and information-rich financial trading tasks, we
present FinAgent , a multimodal foundation agent that integrates
both textual and visual information for a comprehensive analysis
of market dynamics and historical trading patterns. Specifically,
FinAgent ’s market intelligence module processes multimodal data,
such as numerical, textual, and visual, to provide precise analysis
of financial market trends, offering insights for future trading tasks
(Ch1). A uniquely designed dual-level reflection module is devel-
oped, capable of not only rapidly adapting to market dynamics but
also enhancing the agent’s ability to learn from historical data and
improve its decision-making process (Ch2). FinAgent introduces
a diversified memory retrieval system for the market intelligence
and reflection modules, separating trading and retrieval tasks to
enhance focus on their specific functions and minimize noise in the
results (Ch3). Finally, the decision-making module incorporates
expert knowledge, comprising both supplementary expert guid-
ance and auxiliary expert strategies, to guide the agent’s decisions.
This emphasis on providing reasoned explanations for actions fos-
ters trust in its financial decisions (Ch4 &Ch5). Specifically, our
contributions are four-fold:
•We introduce the market intelligence module, which is able to
extract key insights from multimodal datasets encompassing
asset prices, visual representations, news, and expert analyses,
offering a multifaceted view across various markets.
•We not only generate summaries for trading tasks but also pro-
vide query fields for retrieval tasks. These query texts include
different retrieval types, tailored to enable focused retrieval of
specific types of information.
•Our duel-level reflection module combines a low-level reflection
that analyzes market price movement for insights, while the high-
level reflection assesses past trading decisions for improvement,
emulating the learning process in decision-making.
•We employ a suite of tools in FinAgent , including expert guid-
ance and technical indicator-based advanced trading strategies,
to infuse domain knowledge in financial trading.
With comprehensive experiments on 6 financial datasets, including
stocks and Crypto, FinAgent significantly outperforms 12 state-
of-the-art baselines in terms of 6 financial metrics with over 36%
average improvement on profit. Specifically, a 92.27% return (a
84.39% relative improvement) is achieved on one dataset. Notably,
FinAgent is the first advanced multimodal foundation agent de-
signed for financial trading tasks.

like ChatGPT [ 24] and GPT-4 [ 25]. BloombergGPT [ 48] introduced
the first LLM in the finance domain, combining financial and text
data, but without public access. FinGPT [ 50] proposed the first
open-source finance LLMs, incorporating reinforcement learning
with human feedback.
While LLMs achieve impressive performance in NLP tasks [ 5,42],
more works explored the capability of LLMs to function not just as
language processors but as agents capable of performing complex
tasks. Initiatives like AutoGPT [ 51] and MetaGPT [ 12], Voyager
[43], and AI agents [ 28,35] expand LLMs’ capabilities to complex
tasks involving reasoning and collaboration, significantly advanc-
ing technology and impacting daily life. FinMEM [ 56] presents an
LLM agent with a human-aligned memory mechanism and charac-
ter design for automated trading.
Recently, there has been growing interest in enhancing LLM
agents with external tools and modular methods as AI agents.
Tool-augmented Language Models (TALM) [ 22,27,33,41] have
been evaluated through recent benchmarks, such as ScienceQA and
TabMWP [ 4,17,18,20,36,46], designed to assess their ability to
tackle intricate reasoning challenges, particularly those requiring
the use of external tools. These improvements enable LLMs to re-
trieve current information through web searches [ 22] and to apply
specialized knowledge from external sources [55].
However, a major limitation of LLM agents is their dependence
on text-based information, which limits their perception and inter-
action with the environment. Introducing models equipped with
vision capabilities, such as the latest iteration of GPT-4V [ 26], marks
a pivotal breakthrough. There has also been the emergence of mul-
timodal agents [ 19,53,57] utilizing the visual capabilities of mul-
timodal large language models to perform tasks previously un-
achievable by text-only agents. Most existing LLMs in finance focus
on NLP tasks, and their potential in trading is not fully explored.
FinAgent is a multi-modal, tool-augmented LLM foundation agent
for financial trading to bridge the gap.
2.2 AI for Financial Trading
AI techniques have been widely used in various financial trading
tasks. RNN-based such as GRU [ 23] and LSTM [ 44] models are
popular for stock prediction since they are specifically designed to
capture temporal patterns in sequential data. Another direction of
work employs graph-based DL models to model pair-wise relations
between stocks. For instance, Feng et al . [10] enhance graph convo-
lutional networks (GCNs) with temporal convolutions for mining
inter-stock relations. Sawhney et al . [30] focus on stock industry
data and links between company CEOs. Tree-based models [ 14]
also achieve robust performance. Xu and Cohen [49] propose avariational autoencoder architecture to extract latent information
from tweets. Chen et al . [3] enhance trading strategy design with
the investment behaviors of professional fund managers. Other
data sources such as economics news [ 13] and earning calls [ 31]
are also used to improve the prediction performance. Sun et al . [40]
introduce a novel three-stage ensemble learning method. Reinforce-
ment learning [ 39] has achieved success in finance with algorithms,
platform [ 38], and evaluation toolkits [ 37]. However, most of these
methods are hindered by their focus on price data and limited gen-
eralization, necessitating advanced techniques that can integrate
multimodal intelligence and navigate complex market dynamics.
3 PROBLEM FORMULATION
We first introduce the Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation
of financial trading. Later on, we provide the formal formulation
ofFinAgent , which integrates LLMs into the RL pipeline to enable
flexible reasoning and decision-making in financial trading.
3.1 Financial Trading as MDP
A financial trading task involves sequentially making investment
decisions (e.g., buy/sell stocks) to maximize total profit under cer-
tain risk tolerance [ 39]. We formulate it as an MDP under a classic
RL scenario following [ 15,38], where an agent (investor) interacts
with an environment (the financial market) to make actions (invest-
ment decisions) at discrete time to earn rewards (profits). The MDP
is constructed by a 5-tuple (S,A,T,𝑅,𝛾). Specifically, Sis a finite
set of states.Ais a finite set of actions. The state transition function
T:S×A× S→[0,1]encapsulates transition probabilities between
states based on chosen actions. The reward function 𝑅:S×A→𝑅
quantifies the immediate reward of taking an action in a state. The
discount factor is 𝛾∈[0,1). A policy𝜋:S×A→[ 0,1]assigns
each state𝑠∈Sa distribution over actions, where 𝑎∈A has prob-
ability𝜋(𝑎|𝑠). During training, the agent is in charge of making
investment decisions at each time step through one whole trading
period and tries to learn an optimal policy (investment strategy)
that maximizes the expected sum of discounted reward (overall
profit):𝜋𝜃∗=arg max𝜋𝜃E𝜋𝜃[Í𝑇
𝑖=0𝛾𝑖𝑟𝑡+𝑖|𝑠𝑡=𝑠].
Specifically, we focus on single asset (e.g., stock or Crypto) trad-
ing. A state represents RL agents’ perception on the financial mar-
ket based on price information, limited order book [ 29], technical
indicators, trend prediction [ 54], financial news [ 32], experts’ in-
vestment behaviors [ 8] and overall market status [ 47]. The action
space includes three choices to buy, sell or hold the asset [ 7,16]. The
reward function leverages the change of market capitals (earned/lost
money) [16] with consideration of commission fee [38, 45].

3.2 Problem Formulation
We further integrate multimodal LLMs into the RL framework
[6], enabling the flexible definition of the reasoning processes. In
FinAgent formulation, we focus on the necessity of defining, learn-
ing, and applying these processes independently. We extend the
classic RL optimization problem for FinAgent as follows:
𝜋𝜃∗=arg max
𝜋𝜃E𝜋𝜃h∑︁𝑇
𝑖=0𝛾𝑖𝑟𝑡+𝑖|𝑠𝑡=𝑠,𝜇𝑡=𝜇i

where𝑟𝑡is the reward at the time step 𝑡that depends on the envi-
ronmental state 𝑠𝑡and action𝑎𝑡.𝜇(·)are specialized modules that
encapsulate beneficial internal reasoning processes. Note that a
state contains multimodal information including textual, numerical,
and visual data. Faced with a task 𝜆and equipped with a memory

agent, determines its action 𝑎𝑡through the following process:

𝐿𝐿𝑀
𝜙𝜆
𝐷(𝑠𝑡,𝜇𝑡)
𝜇𝑡=𝜇(𝑠𝑡,𝑀𝑒𝑚𝜆
𝑡,𝑇𝑜𝑜𝑙𝜆
𝑡)(2)
where𝜙(·)is a task-relevant prompt generator. The prompt is then
passed to a multimodal LLM, from which a response is generated. Fi-
nally, the response is parsed through the task-specific action parsing
functionD𝜆(·)to perform compatible actions in the environment.
FinAgent is a multimodal LLMs agent in this framework specif-
ically designed for financial trading, which contains five core mod-
ules, namely market intelligence module (M ), memory module
(Mem ), low-level reflection module (L), high-level reflection module
(H) and decision-making module (D). We can define the 𝜇𝑡and
other modules as follows:
𝜇𝑡=𝜇(𝑠𝑡,𝑀𝑒𝑚𝜆

Therefore, with the integration of memory mechanism, aug-
mented tools, and several designed modules, the overall objective

4 FINAGENT FRAMEWORK
As shown in Figure 3, the FinAgent framework comprises five
core modules. Specifically, the market intelligence module (§4.1) is
responsible for collecting, collating, summarizing, and analyzing
market information, which includes daily updates on stock news,
prices, and monthly and quarterly financial reports. The low-level
reflection module (§4.3) establishes the inherent correlation be-
tween market intelligence and price changes. And the high-level
reflection module (§4.3) involves reflecting on market conditions,
price changes, and other factors in the context of outcomes from
past trading decisions, which aims to derive insights from previous
experiences and identify potential improvement in profitability byassessing the efficacy of historical decisions and offering recom-
mendations for future decision-making processes. The primary role
of the memory module (§4.2) is to support the aforementioned
three modules by offering storage capabilities and vector retrieve
functions. The tool-augmented decision-making module (§4.4) in-
tegrates the aforementioned information, along with augmented
tools and trader preferences, to make final investment decisions
with a comprehensive analysis.
4.1 Market Intelligence Module
To make profitable investment decisions, it is beneficial to collect,
summarize, analyze, and extract key insights from various multi-
modal financial data sources. We design the market intelligence
module to achieve this goal. Market intelligence typically involves
daily data about the macro environment, current market conditions
or investors’ sentiments that inform investment and trading deci-
sions. In FinAgent , we harness the power of both the latest and
historical news, financial reports, and asset prices related to the
targeted asset in order to inform and optimize trading decisions.
Latest Market Intelligence. This module mainly consists of asset
news and daily asset prices. However, it is not confined to these
elements alone. Any information impacting the market can be
encompassed within our framework as part of the latest market
intelligence. The objective of this component is to evaluate the
sentiment2of each market intelligence item regarding its influence
on future asset prices and to provide a detailed summary of whether
the market has recently exhibited bearish or bullish tendencies,
thereby assisting in informed decision-making.
Nevertheless, historical data can offer insights into patterns that
might influence future pricing and potentially affect current and
upcoming market dynamics. For instance, if a past product launch
significantly boosted a company’s stock, a recent launch might have
a similar effect3. We hope to incorporate these historical experiences
and patterns into FinAgent ’s considerations. This inspired us to add
two additional functional layers: retrieving relevant information
from past market intelligence and summarizing key insights and
historical experiences from them.
Diversified Retrieval Operation. A straightforward approach
involves using the summary of the latest market intelligence as the
query text and then employing an LLM to extract its semantically
rich embeddings. This allows for retrieving past market intelligence
with similar content through vector similarity. However, adopting
this approach inevitably comes with two significant shortcomings:
i) the summary of recent market intelligence is primarily aimed
at supporting subsequent trading decision tasks, not for retrieval
tasks. The significant gap between these two objectives can lead to
unsatisfactory retrieval results; ii) some noise unrelated to the re-
trieval task may be contained in the summary, directly affecting the
retrieval results. To address these challenges, diversified retrieval
is implemented in FinAgent . Specifically, we have introduced an
additional query text field to the output of the latest market intelli-
gence component, which is dedicated to serving retrieval tasks in
parallel with the summary that caters to trading tasks. It is worth
2Market intelligence can be categorized as positive, negative, or neutral based on its
impact on market perceptions and potential outcomes.

emphasizing that we can define various retrieval types4to enable
an agent to retrieve past market intelligence from multiple perspec-
tives, in multiple senses, and with a purpose. As shown in Figure 3,
there are𝑀retrieval types, so retrieving top 𝐾historical market
intelligence separately can form a combination of 𝑀×𝐾market
intelligence in the past. This approach assigns specific retrieval
types to each piece of historical information accompanying the
summaries. This nuanced labeling facilitates a more targeted and
efficient search and retrieval process.
Past Market Intelligence. Once similar past market intelligence is
searched, it undergoes the summarising step, delivering key insights
tailored to augment trading decisions. This meticulous approach
ensures that only the most relevant information is incorporated,
mitigating the impact of noise and maximizing the utility of histor-
ical data in informing trading strategies.
4.2 Memory Module
The memory mechanism [ 6,28,57] is crucial in LLM Agents for
effectively handling extensive texts, grasping the context, ensuring
the coherence of conversations, and improving the agent’s com-
prehension and logical abilities. In the context of multimodal LLM
agents for financial trading, memory mechanisms play a crucial
role in three main aspects: i) Acuity. This feature enables multi-
modal LLM agents to use market news, financial reports, and other
information for better market forecasting. By analyzing historical
data and current events, these agents can predict market trends and
asset prices more accurately, aiding in effective trading decisions. ii)
Adaptability. As market conditions change rapidly, memory mecha-
nisms allow multimodal LLM agents to quickly learn and adapt. By
continuously analyzing market data and trading outcomes, these
agents adjust their strategies to handle volatility and seize new
opportunities. iii) Amendability. It helps multimodal LLM agents
learn from past mistakes and successful trades. By reflecting on
these experiences, agents can avoid repeating errors and improve
4The retrieval types include short-term, medium/long-term market impacts, asset price
increase/decrease, market trends bearish/bullish, news/reports, etc.their trading strategies. This continuous learning enhances their
performance and creates more robust, efficient trading strategies.
To realize the 3Asuperiority - Acuity, Adaptability, and Amend-
ability - in the memory mechanism, our development of the mem-
ory module employed a vector storage architecture. This module is
composed of three main components: market intelligence memory
(service for (§4.1)), low-level reflection memory (service for ( §4.3)),
and high-level reflection memory (service for (§4.3)). As shown
in Figure 3, the summarize operation creates a query text field for
each module, enhancing memory storage and retrieval. The market
intelligence module uniquely retrieves past data through query
text, using vector representations for efficient matching based on
the vector similarity. All analyses and summaries from the market
intelligence, low-level reflection, and high-level reflection modules
are stored in the memory module. This integration equips the agent
with extensive market data and insights, improving its decision-
making capabilities.
4.3 Reflection Module
A reflection module is incorporated into the agent’s design to em-
ulate the cognitive learning process inherent in human decision-
making. The reflection framework is divided into low-level reflec-
tion and high-level reflection, each serving distinct purposes to
enhance the agent’s trading decisions. The low-level reflection
module involves reflecting on the relationship between the agent’s
observations (e.g., news, financial reports, Kline chart and technical
indicators) and the resultant price movements in the market, draw-
ing connections between the provided information and the actual
price changes. Whereas the high-level reflection step examines past
decisions, tracking both the agent’s actions and the subsequent
price movements in order to learn from past successes or mistakes.
Low-level Reflection Module The primary focus of the low-level
reflection module is to analyze the connection between the given
market intelligence together with the Kline chart and technical
indicators and past and future price changes to enhance decision-
making. After taking in the price change data, the module generates
detailed analysis for varying temporal horizons, spanning short-
term, medium-term to long-term perspectives. The emphasis is

placed on identifying potential patterns in the price movements of
the targeted stock and deriving insights from how the given market
intelligence summaries and Kline chart analysis can lead to such
price movements. In order to facilitate future access and reference,
the module generates a query field containing a concise summary
of learned lessons, ensuring efficient retrieval and application of
insights in subsequent decision-making endeavors.

High-level Reflection Module The high-level reflection mod-
ule is designed to provide analysis and reflections on past trading
decisions. Besides the past trading decisions and their underlying
reasoning, this module incorporates a graphical representation of
buy and sell points on a trading chart, coupled with a cumulative
return plot, to offer an intuitive representation of the efficacy of his-
torical decisions. The initial phase assesses each trading decision’s
correctness, identifying successes and mistakes. Subsequently, the
module recommends improvements or corrective actions tailored to
each identified mistake or success, fostering a continuous learning
process. Beyond individual decision analysis, the module generatesoverarching lessons from both successes and mistakes, providing
a summary that can be adapted to future trading decisions and a
query text to facilitate the retrieval of relevant reflections. This iter-
ative learning process equips the agent with a dynamic knowledge
base that evolves with each decision and allows the trading agent
to draw connections between similar scenarios, applying learned
lessons for more informed decision-making.
4.4 Tool-Augmented Decision-making Module
The decision-making module integrates key inputs, including mar-
ket intelligence summaries, low-level reflection about price move-
ment analyses, and reflections on past decisions. Augmented tools
with professional investment guidance and traditional trading strate-
gies like MACD Crossover, KDJ with RSI Filter and Mean Reversion
are also considered. The module analyzes sentiment in market in-
telligence, predicts bullish or bearish trends from price movements,
reflects on lessons learned, and evaluates professional guidance
and traditional indicators. Decisions are derived from combining
insights from these analyses, also considering the current financial
position, leading to a final decision—whether to buy, sell, or hold
the asset. Leveraging the Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach and
in-context learning principles, our trading decision-making mod-
ule not only executes trades but also provides reasoning, ensuring
that each decision is rooted in a comprehensive understanding of
market dynamics and contextual knowledge.

5 EXPERIMENT SETUP
Our research aims to conduct a thorough evaluation of FinAgent ’s
trading effectiveness, underscoring its unique capability to func-
tion efficiently with a significantly reduced historical data training
window. This assessment also involves leveraging multimodal data
inputs, incorporating both informational and agent-assistive aug-
mented tools, along with a multi-perspective diversified retrieval.
This approach is intended to enhance the understanding of mar-
ket dynamics and sentiments, enabling more comprehensive and
logical decision-making processes along with substantiated expla-
nations. To validate its effectiveness, we have conducted a series of
experiments to address the following research questions (RQs):
•RQ1: Is FinAgent outperforming current state-of-the-art trading
agents and handling tasks that challenge other algorithms?
•RQ2: What is the effectiveness of each component of FinAgent
in contributing to its overall performance?
•RQ3: Does the integration of augmented tools in FinAgent lead
to a distinguishable improvement in its trading performance?
•RQ4: How effective is the diversified retrieval in FinAgent?

To conduct a thorough evaluation of FinAgent , we evaluate it
across 6 real-world datasets. These included five datasets from the
US stock markets, and one is the cryptocurrency. Each of them has
multiple forms of data that come from various sources. Specifically,
i)Asset Price at the day-level, including price data for open, high,
low, close, and adj close. ii) Visual Data consists of historical Kline
charts and trading charts, which are visual representations of asset
market data and trading process on a daily basis. iii) Asset News
coverage with daily updates from various esteemed sources such as
Bloomberg Technology, Seeking Alpha and CNBC Television, en-
suring a diverse and thorough perspective on the financial markets.
iv)Expert Guidance provided by financial experts as the auxil-
iary information, aiming to furnish a thorough and well-rounded
comprehension of market status. We summarize statistics of the 6
datasets in Table 3 and further elaborate on them in Appendix A.
Our diversified portfolio includes five major stocks: Apple Inc.
(AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Mi-
crosoft Corporation (MSFT), and Tesla Inc. (TSLA) and a prominent
cryptocurrency named Ethereum (ETHUSD). This selection aims
to showcase FinAgent ’s versatility and consistency across various
financial assets. Chosen for their extensive news coverage and rep-
resentation of different market sectors, these data provide a robust
basis for assessing FinAgent ’s generalization capabilities across
diverse financial environments. For dataset split, the data from the
latter half of the year is allocated for testing (2023-06-01 ∼2024-01-
01) purposes, while the data from the penultimate year is utilized
for training (2022-06-01 ∼2023-06-01).5.2 Evaluation Metrics
We compare FinAgent and baselines in terms of 6 financial metrics
following [ 29,38], which include 1 profit metric: annual return rate
(ARR), 3 risk-adjusted profit metrics: Sharpe ratio (SR), Calmar ratio
(CR), Sortino ratio (SOR), and 2 risk metrics: maximum drawdown
(MDD), volatility (VOL). Definitions and formulas are as follows:
•Annual Rate of Return (ARR) is the annualized average return
rate, calculated as 𝐴𝑅𝑅=𝑉𝑇−𝑉0
𝑉0×𝐶
𝑇, where𝑇is the total number
of trading days, and 𝐶=252is the number of trading days within
a year.𝑉𝑇and𝑉0represent the final and initial portfolio values.
•Sharpe Ratio (SR) measures risk-adjusted returns of portfolios.
It is defined as 𝑆𝑅=E[r]
𝜎[r], where E[·]is the expectation, 𝜎[·]is
the standard deviation, r=[𝑉1−𝑉0
𝑉0,𝑉2−𝑉1
𝑉1,...,𝑉𝑇−𝑉𝑇−1
𝑉𝑇−1]𝑇denotes
the historical sequence of the return rate.
•Volatility (VOL) is the variation in an investment’s return over
time, measured as the standard deviation 𝜎[r].
•Maximum Drawdown (MDD) measures the largest loss from
any peak to show the worst case. It is defined as: 𝑀𝐷𝐷 =max𝑇
𝑖=0𝑃𝑖−𝑅𝑖
𝑃𝑖,
where𝑅𝑖=Î𝑇
𝑖=1𝑉𝑖
𝑉𝑖−1and𝑃𝑖=max𝑇
𝑖=1𝑅𝑖.
•Calmar Ratio (CR) compares average annualized return to
maximum drawdown, assessing risk-adjusted performance. It is
defined as𝐶𝑅=E[r]
𝑀𝐷𝐷.
•Sortino Ratio (SoR) is a risk-adjusted measure that focuses
on the downside risk of a portfolio. It is defined as 𝑆𝑜𝑅=E[r]
𝐷𝐷,
where𝐷𝐷is the standard deviation of negative return.
5.3 Baselines
We compare and evaluate the trading performance of FinAgent
with four widely accepted conventional rule-based trading strate-
gies (B&H, MACD, KDJ&RSI andZMR) and eight advanced algo-
rithms. Among these, price prediction models based on machine
learning and deep learning (ML & DL-based) include LGBM[ 52],
LSTM[ 52], and Transformer[ 52].SAC [11],PPO [34] and DQN
[21] are three models employed deep reinforcement learning (RL-
based) methods, FinGPT [50] is based on LLM, and another is
FinMem [56] that based on LLM Agents. The following will pro-
vide a brief introduction to each model:
•Rule-based
–Buy-and-Hold (B&H) involves holding assets for an extended
period, regardless of short-term market fluctuations, assuming
that long-term returns will be more favorable.
–Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a tech-
nical analysis tool that uses MACD indicator and signal line
crossovers to identify trading signals and market trends.
–KDJ with RSI Filter (KDJ&RSI) integrates the KDJ indicator for
detecting market extremes with the RSI indicator for momentum
analysis to identify precise trading signals in financial markets.
–Z-score Mean Reversion (ZMR) assumes that the price will
revert to its mean over time with the metric of Z-score.
•ML&DL-based
–LGBM [52] uses a series of tree models to predict price fluctua-
tions and provide buy and sell signals.
–LSTM [52] utilizes long short-term memory to improve the ac-
curacy of price predictions.

5.4 Implementation Details
Although FinAgent ’s training and inference can be done without a
GPU, we utilized a single NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU for our bench-
mark methods. To ensure equitable comparison, all benchmarks
are conducted within the same RL environment for both training
and evaluation. The following experiments related to FinAgent all
have diversified retrieval if not specifically noted. Details on the
benchmark and experiments setup are provided in Appendix C.6 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Comparison with Baselines (RQ1). We compared FinAgent with
9 baseline methods in terms of 6 financial metrics. Table 4 and Figure
4 demonstrate our method significantly outperforms existing base-
lines, especially remarkable improvements in profitability, and set-
ting a new benchmark in the field. The full results and case studies of
FinAgent are avaliable in Appendix B. FinAgent ’s performance on
the five stocks, as measured by ARR% and SR, with enhancements
of at least 10% and 19%, compared to the best-performing baseline,
respectively. Notably, its performance on the TSLA dataset stands
out even more, achieving 84% and 118% improvement, significantly
outperforming all other baselines. Across all datasets, FinAgent is
the only method that consistently outperforms the broader mar-
ket in terms of profitability. In contrast, FinMem falls short on
the AMZN dataset, where its ARR% is 40%, underperforming the
market’s Buy & Hold (B&H) strategy at 42%. This underscores the
superior stability and robustness of FinAgent compared to other
baselines. We can also observe that rule-based methods are optimal
in controlling risk, but not outstanding in capturing returns. This is
because rule-based model methods are robust to outliers and noise
in the data and thus can reduce decision risk. It is worth noting
that high returns often come with high risks. Hence, FinAgent rep-
resents a slight compromise on risk control. This result relates to
our chosen investor preference of an aggressive trader. Therefore,
4321A Multimodal Foundation Agent for Financial Trading: Tool-Augmented, Diversified, and Generalist KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
FinAgent can take on slightly higher risk to achieve substantially
greater returns. It allows FinAgent to optimize performance by
balancing risk and reward effectively.
Figure 4 illustrates that FinAgent ’s performance surpasses other
methods regarding cumulative returns, particularly on the TSLA
dataset. Leveraging market intelligence and the reflection mech-
anism, FinAgent anticipates a significant stock price drop post-
September 14, 2023. By taking a short position, it can effectively
hedge against potential trading losses and generate high returns.
It’s important to note that our approach yields slightly lower re-
turns than FinMem on the cryptocurrency ETH, primarily because
our auxiliary agents are specialized strategies tailored for stocks,
not for cryptocurrencies with higher trading frequency. Further
insights from the ablation study section for FinAgent reveal that
employing a generalized auxiliary agent for cryptocurrency could
potentially increase returns to 54%, compared to the current 44%.
This significant difference will be elaborated upon in the forthcom-
ing ablation studies.
7 ABLATION STUDIES
7.1 Effectiveness of Each Component (RQ2)
In Table 5, we study the effectiveness of market intelligence (M ),
low-level reflection (L), high-level reflection (H ) and augmented
tools ( T). When compared to using solely MandML, the integration
of the low-level reflection module leads to an impressive increase
in ARR% by 45% to 101% for TSLA, and ETHUSD, and cutting risk
by 14% to 44%. When comparing the MLandMLH, the addition of
the high-level reflection module significantly enhances the ARR%
and SR, while notably reducing risk. This improvement comes with
a minor trade-off: a slight 7% rise in MDD% for TSLA. Compared to
MLH andMLHT, there’s a minor improvement in stock profitability.
However, the performance of ETH cryptocurrency dropped by over
20% due to the introduction of rule-based methods as auxiliary
agents, which are specialized only for stocks.

7.2 Effectiveness of Augmented Tools (RQ3)
As previously discussed, while the addition of auxiliary agents to
stock investments results in profit improvements, it causes a consid-
erable performance decline in cryptocurrencies. Thus, we conduct
the experiment that decisions are made solely by augmented tools,
such as rule-based methods serving as auxiliary agents. We con-
ducted the experiment in which various auxiliary agents provided
both decisions and their explanations. These inputs are directly
integrated into FinAgent ’s decision-making module without other
modules’ involvement in the final decision process. As shown in
Table 4 and Table 5, the 16% ARR% for solely Tmethod starklycontrasts with the 29% ARR% of B&H in ETHUSD, highlighting the
inefficacy of the stock-specific rule-based methods for cryptocurren-
cies and demonstrating that introducing to FinAgent significantly
affects performance. This suggests that investors should not indis-
criminately add auxiliary agents for investment support. Instead,
they must meticulously select agents that match the characteristics
of the market to avoid detrimental impact on performance.
7.3 Effectiveness of Diversified Retrieval (RQ4)
As shown in Figure 5(a), we compare the performance of FinAgent
with or without diversified retrieval on AAPL, and find that the use
of diversified retrieval can contribute an obvious improvement in
ARR and SR. As shown in Figure 5(b), we extract different types of
market intelligence that AAPL diversified retrieve to daily on the
validation set and filter out individuals with the same content under
the same type. We perform t-SNE visualization of its LLM extracted
embedding, and we can find that the LLM extracted embedding has
a clear distinction between different retrieval types, which proves
the effectiveness of our method.

8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper introduces FinAgent , a financial trading agent pow-
ered by LLM that exhibits high reasoning ability and generalizabil-
ity.FinAgent is a multimodal agent that integrates both textual
and visual data, enabling a comprehensive understanding of mar-
ket dynamics and historical trading behaviors. It is designed to
independently leverage auxiliary tools for detailed market data
analysis over different time scales. With its multi-perspective and
diverse retrieval approach, FinAgent effectively identifies correla-
tions between current market conditions and past market patterns
and trends and integrates market information to make final and
effective decisions. For future research directions, we will apply
FinAgent to other financial tasks, such as portfolio management,
where LLM is used to rank each stock according to the observed
market intelligence and make the stock selection.

A DETAILS OF DATASETS AND PROCESSING
To conduct a thorough evaluation of FinAgent , we evaluate it
across 6 real-world datasets. These included five datasets from the
US stock markets and one is the cryptocurrency. Each of them have
multiple forms of data that come from various sources. Specifically,
i)Asset Price at the day-level, including price data for open, high,
low, close, and adj close; ii) Visual Data consists of historical Kline
charts and trading charts, which are visual representations of asset
market data and trading process on a daily basis; iii) Asset News
coverage with daily updates from various esteemed sources, includ-
ing Bloomberg Technology, Seeking Alpha, CNBC Television, and
more, ensuring a diverse and thorough perspective on the financial
markets; iv) Expert Guidance provided by financial experts as
the auxiliary information, aiming to furnish a thorough and well-
rounded comprehension of market status. We summarize statistics
of the 6 datasets in Table 3 and further elaborate on them as follows:
Asset. We selected a varied portfolio comprising five stocks Ap-
ple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL),
Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), and Tesla Inc. (TSLA), a foreign ex-
change pair, and a prominent cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH).
This selection aims to showcase FinAgent ’s versatility and consis-
tency across various financial assets. Chosen for their extensive
news coverage and representation of different market sectors, these
data provide a robust basis for assessing FinAgent ’s generalization
capabilities across diverse financial environments.Price and News. We acquired price and news data for all as-
sets from Financial Modeling Prep5(FMP), wherein the price data
encompasses including open, high, low, clos, and adj close. The
news data is sourced from renowned market analysis and stock
research platforms, notably including Seeking Alpha and so on.
This selection ensures a comprehensive dataset, integrating both
quantitative financial metrics and qualitative market insights.
Visual Data. Within the textual data framework, we furnish
FinAgent with visual information, specifically including historical
Kline charts and trading line charts, to enhance its analytical capa-
bilities. The tool employed for this plotting task is the pyecharts6,
a specialized library for financial data visualization.
Expert Guidance. Expert Guidance is provided as a distinct
component of the auxiliary information by augmented tools. This
selection ensures a comprehensive dataset, integrating professional
analysts and individual investors insights, fostering a diverse range
of perspectives in the investment community. We obtained the
expert professional analysis from Seeking Alpha7. Seeking Alpha
is a popular platform among investors and financial analysts, is
renowned for its diverse professional analysis, providing valuable
insights from seasoned analysts across the financial market spec-
trum.
Trading Date. For dataset split, the data from the latter half of
the year is allocated for testing (2023-06-018∼2024-01-01) purposes,
while the data from the penultimate year is utilized for training
(2022-06-01∼2023-06-01).
B DETAILS OF COMPARISON WITH
BASELINES
We compared FinAgent with 9 baseline methods in terms of 6
financial metrics. Table 6 and Figure 4 demonstrate our method
significantly outperforms existing baselines, especially remarkable
improvements in profitability, and setting a new benchmark in the
field.
C DETAILS OF IMPLEMENTATION
Although FinAgent ’s training and inference can be done with-
out a GPU, we utilized a single NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU for our
benchmark methods. For dataset split, the data from the latter
half of the year is allocated for testing (2023-06-01 ∼2024-01-01)
purposes, while the data from the penultimate year is utilized for
training (2022-06-01 ∼2023-06-01). To ensure equitable comparison,
all benchmarks are conducted within the same RL environment for
both training and evaluation.
Benchmark Setup. In the training phase, we use OPTUNA [ 1]
for hyperparameter optimization, adapting both rule-based and RL
methods to trading. This process is followed by an evaluation with
the optimal parameters. We employ the officially provided default
parameters for both training and testing of FinGPT and FinMem.
FinAgent Setup. For each training dataset, we perform only one
round of training without the usual requirement for multiple it-
erations in fine-tuning LLMs. As demonstrated by FinMem [ 56],
5FMP API provides data about stock historical price and news, company financial
statements, and cryptocurrencies. Entry is https://site.financialmodelingprep.com.

sequently, we have selected GPT-4 as the foundational LLM for
FinAgent . For the market intelligence and decision-making mod-
ules, which do not process visual data, we use the gpt-4-1106-preview .
In contrast, the two reflection modules, which require an in-depth
understanding of visual data, utilize gpt-4-vision-preview . For
the memory module, which is designed to store and retrieve texts
based on text similarity, a text encoder is essential for vectorizing
the text. We adopt text-embedding-3-large for this purpose. The
top-k of our retrieval samples is 5. In the low-level reflection mod-
ule, short term, medium term and long term are for the latest 1 day,
7 days and 14 days respectively. It is important to note that past
and future asset price increases and decreases are visible during the
training phase, but only past trends are visible during the testing
phase to prevent data leakage. The following experiments related
toFinAgent all have diversified retrieval if not specifically noted.
