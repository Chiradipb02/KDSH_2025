ABSTRACT
The epiDAMIK workshop serves as a platform for advancing the
utilization of data-driven methods in the fields of epidemiology
and public health research. These fields have seen relatively limited
exploration of data-driven approaches compared to other disci-
plines. Therefore, our primary objective is to foster the growth
and recognition of the emerging discipline of data-driven and com-
putational epidemiology, providing a valuable avenue for sharing
state-of-the-art research and ongoing projects. The workshop also
seeks to showcase results that are not typically presented at major
computing conferences, including valuable insights gained from
practical experiences. Our target audience encompasses researchers
in AI, machine learning, and data science from both academia and
industry, who have a keen interest in applying their work to epi-
demiological and public health contexts. Additionally, we welcome
practitioners from mathematical epidemiology and public health,
as their expertise and contributions greatly enrich the discussions.

1 INTRODUCTION
While the worst of COVID-19 pandemic has most likely passed us,
an occurrence of equally devastating global pandemic or regional
epidemic cannot be ruled out in future. H1N1, Zika, SARS, MERS,
and Ebola outbreaks over the past few decades have sharply illus-
trated our enormous vulnerability to emerging infectious diseases.
While the data mining research community has demonstrated in-
creased interest in epidemiological applications, much is still left to
be desired. For example, there is an urgent need to develop sound
theoretical principles and transformative computational approaches
that will allow us to address the escalating threat of current and
future pandemics. Data mining and knowledge discovery have an
important role to play in this regard. Different aspects of infec-
tious disease modeling, analysis, and control have traditionally
been studied within the confines of individual disciplines, such as
mathematical epidemiology and public health, and data mining and
machine learning. Coupled with increasing data generation across
multiple domains/sources (e.g., wastewater surveillance, electronic
medical records, and social media), there is a clear need for ana-
lyzing them to inform public health policies and outcomes timely.
Recent advances in disease surveillance and forecasting, and initia-
tives such as the CDC Flu Challenge, CDC COVID-19 Forecasting
Hub etc., have brought these disciplines closer together. On the
one hand, public health practitioners seek to use novel datasets,
such as Safegraph, Unacast, and Google mobility data, and tech-
niques like Graph Neural Networks. On the other hand, researchers
from data mining and machine learning develop novel tools for
solving many fundamental problems in the public health policy
planning and decision-making process, leveraging novel datasets
(e.g., COVID-19 behavioral health surveys, contact tracing trees,
and satellite images of urban streets) and combining them with
more traditional time series information (e.g., surveillance, hospital-
ization, and death records). We believe the next stage of advances
will result from closer collaborations between these two groups,
which is the main objective of epiDAMIK.

2 WORKSHOP RELEVANCE
Respiratory viruses such as COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV have
caused significant mortality and morbidity worldwide, impacting
almost all aspects of modern life. The COVID-19 pandemic alone
has resulted in over 7 million deaths across six continents, while a
third of countries have faced recession and many economies are
still grappling with high unemployment rates. Moreover, the past
decade has seen multiple deadly outbreaks, including MERS in
2012 and Ebola in 2013-2016, alongside the potential for severe
seasonal influenza seasons, such as the notably harsh 2017-18 flu
season. Consequently, the impact of infectious diseases has been
a global focal point, generating widespread demand for rapid ad-
vancements in epidemiology from the public, governmental, and
academic sectors. Although the emergency status of COVID-19
was declared over in April 2023, state and federal public health
agencies are increasingly adopting data-driven approaches for in-
fectious disease surveillance, forecasting, and control. This shift is
evidenced by the establishment of the CDC’s new Center for Fore-
casting and Outbreak Analytics (CFA), which awarded $250M in
grants last year, and the NSF’s Predictive Intelligence for Pandemic
Prevention (PIPP), which will award $126M, demonstrating a sig-
nificant commitment of resources to this crucial field. Additionally,
health and data science researchers, having devoted the past few
years to emergency response, are now focusing on retrospective
analyses and pandemic preparedness, in collaboration with policy
stakeholders. This transition is further complemented by the rapid
advancements in deep learning techniques for forecasting, opti-
mization, and information retrieval, offering new opportunities for
innovative solutions that can profoundly impact public health. Thus,
we are uniquely positioned to attract a wide array of researchers,
including those who may not typically engage with SIGKDD, to
further our understanding and preparedness for infectious disease
challenges.

4 PARTICIPATION AND REVIEW PROCESS
Each submitted paper received at least two blind reviews. The final
acceptance/rejection decision is made by program chairs based on
the reviews each paper received. Final decision also includes the
information on whether each paper is accepted as a oral or poster
paper. The accepted papers must be formatted according to the
ACM SIG Proceedings template. All accepted papers will be hosted
at1and featured on the workshop’s website. At least one author
from each accepted paper must register, attend, and present their
work at the workshop.
5 PROGRAM OUTLINE
epiDAMIK @ KDD 2024 is a half-day workshop. We are aiming to
present a balanced program consisting of the following elements,
allowing for ample opportunity for discussion and networking:
•Invited Talks (about 3, 45 minutes each, including questions)
•Oral Papers (15 minutes for presentation, 5 for discussion)
•Poster Papers (45 minute poster and networking session)
6 EXPECTED OUTCOME
The expected outcome of the workshop are new insights into how
data mining can play a bigger role in epidemiology and public
health research. We want to further raise attention to the emerging
research area of data-driven and computational epidemiology, and
create a venue for presenting state-of-the-art and in-progress results
that would benefit from peer feedback.
