ABSTRACT
Deep Learning has facilitated various high-stakes applications such
as crime detection, urban planning, drug discovery, and healthcare.
Its continuous success hinges on learning from massive data in
miscellaneous sources, ranging from data with independent distri-
butions to graph-structured data capturing intricate inter-sample
relationships. Scaling up the data access requires global collabora-
tion from distributed data owners. Yet, centralizing all data sources
to an untrustworthy centralized server will put users’ data at risk
of privacy leakage or regulation violation. Federated Learning (FL)
is ade facto decentralized learning framework that enables knowl-
edge aggregation from distributed users without exposing private
data. Though promising advances are witnessed for FL, new chal-
lenges are emerging when integrating FL with the rising needs and
opportunities in data mining, graph analytics, foundation models,
generative AI, and new interdisciplinary applications in science. By
hosting this workshop, we aim to attract a broad range of audiences,
including researchers and practitioners from academia and industry
interested in the emergent challenges in FL. As an effort to advance
the fundamental development of FL, this workshop will encourage
ideas exchange on the trustworthiness, scalability, and robustness
of distributed data mining and graph analytics and their emergent
challenges.

1 INTRODUCTION
Extracting and analyzing knowledge from a vast array of distributed
data sources is crucial for the development of robust AI models to
satisfy the increasing demands of advanced analytics. Traditional
methods of centralized learning encounter numerous obstacles in
distributed learning environments, primarily due to concerns over
privacy and stringent regulatory standards such as the GDPR and
HIPAA that govern the exchange of sensitive data. The core issue
lies in the distributed nature of data and the regulations restricting
the sharing of confidential information. Federated learning (FL), a
novel approach, has risen to prominence by enabling the extraction
of insights from sensitive, distributed data sources through the
consolidation of knowledge from distributed models instead of
direct data sharing, thereby addressing privacy concerns effectively.
Despite its undeniable success in addressing real-world chal-
lenges, applying FL to practical data mining tasks is fraught with
difficulties due to varying data characteristics. Among various data
forms that fuel up AI developments, graph serves as a cornerstone
of data mining due to its fundamental and flexible structures to
model various types of real-world data into entities and relations.
Graph analytics, fueled by recent advances in machine learning
(e.g., graph neural networks and graph transformers), have been
widely practiced in crucial application domains such as physics, ma-
terial sciences, social sciences, finance, transportation, and public
health. While pioneering FL developments were built upon images,

texts, and tabular data sources from independent distributions, it is
imperative to bridge FL with graph analytics to further expand the
spectrum of practical FL that advances data mining with comprehen-
sive data characteristics. Furthermore, FL faces hurdles stemming
from adversarial computational nodes, obscured yet tainted train-
ing data, erratic network conditions, inconstant system dynamics,
and diverse computational capabilities. These factors compromise
the scalability and reliability of FL systems.
The workshop will delve into both foundational and advanced
issues in FL, incorporating a focus on graph analytics within the
following four categories. Different from the previous workshops,
FedGraph at ICDM 2023 or Federated Learning for Distributed Data
Mining at KDD 2023, the workshop will bring in new challenges
accompanied by the emergence of large models, generative AI, and
new interdisciplinary applications in science.
1) Scaling laws of FL facing increasingly larger and more heteroge-
nous data, models, and computation-or-communication resources.
Essentially, we look for studies on how the effectiveness of existing
or new FL algorithms changes by the scaling. 2) Safety. Problems
and solutions for the security, privacy, and social alignment of FL
systems and the resultant models. Especially, when training large
generative AI models, the potential risks and countermeasures in
FL systems are welcome to discuss. 3) Graph Analytics. Intuitions
and solutions to close the gap between centralized and decentral-
ized graph analysis. 4) Other high-stakes applications. Explo-
rations on novel research problems of FL and FL algorithms for
real-world applications. Moreover, we aim to attract high-quality
original research of federated learning with applications, evalua-
tion, and algorithms. We also plan to invite open discussions on
controversial yet crucial topics regarding FL systems and discuss
their barriers in data mining.
2 AUDIENCE AND SCHEDULE
Diversity Commitment. During the selection of organizers and
speakers, we commit to encouraging all forms of diversity. Both
groups achieved gender parity and are also diverse with respect
to affiliations, races, and nationalities. The full scale of scientific
seniority is covered, including PhD candidates, senior research sci-
entists, as well as assistant and full professors. We also cover diverse
research backgrounds (graph mining, federated learning, machine
learning, systems, privacy, and applications), and our invited talks
cover a diverse set of perspectives related to federated learning for
data mining and graph analytics.
We envision a good amount of attendees (60+) and submissions
(30+) to our workshop, coming from but not limited to several
national and international research teams from both academia and
industry. Based on our knowledge, well-known groups interested
in the Federated Learning for data mining and graph (besides those
of the organizers and invited speakers of this workshop) include
and are not limited to
Schedule. The format of the workshop is a half-day event (4
hours). We will invite 4 keynote speakers who are leading experts
from academia and industry. We will have contributed papers as
both oral and poster presentations for accepted ones. We will high-
light outstanding papers in the award ceremony. This is intendedto encourage presenting high-quality work that interests the com-
munity.

We invite short technical papers - up to 5 pages including ref-
erences and unlimited pages of appendix. All manuscripts should
be submitted in a single PDF file including all content, figures,
tables, and references, following the new Standard ACM Confer-
ence Proceedings Template. Additionally, papers must be in the
two-column format, with the recommended setting for Latex file:
\documentclass[sigconf, review]{acmart}. Papers should be sub-
mitted to openreview website at https://openreview.net/group?
id=KDD.org/2024/Workshop/FedKDD. While all accepted papers
will be presented with posters, high-quality accepted papers will
also have the opportunity to participate in the oral/spotlight pre-
sentation and win our Best Paper Award(s). We will also present
accepted papers on our website. More details in our website: https:

4 REVIEW PROCESS
The review process for contributed material will be double-blind
to reduce institutional and author bias, and the program will be
selected with an eye to establishing broad coverage of research areas
while preserving merit awarded by the double-blind reviewing
process. We will also attract a wide and diverse program committee.
Each submission will be reviewed by at least 2 reviewers. Decisions
will be made in a transparent way by the organizers. To discourage
the presentation of already finalized machine learning work, novelty
and scope for discussion will be explicit aspects of the reviews.
Conflicts of interest will be avoided by asking reviewers to state
their conflicts.
