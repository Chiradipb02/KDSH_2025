ABSTRACT
Urbanization’s rapid progress has led to many big cities, which have
modernized many people’s lives but also engendered big challenges,
such as air pollution, increased energy consumption, and traffic
congestion. Tackling these challenges was nearly impossible years
ago given the complex and dynamic settings of cities. Nowadays,
sensing technologies and large-scale computing infrastructures
have produced a variety of big data in urban spaces, e.g., human
mobility, air quality, traffic patterns, and geographical data. Moti-
vated by the opportunities of building more intelligent cities, we
came up with a vision of urban computing, which aims to unlock
the power of knowledge from big and heterogeneous data collected
in urban spaces and apply this powerful information to solve major
issues our cities face today.

1 INTRODUCTION
Urban computing is a process of acquisition, integration, and analy-
sis of big and heterogeneous data generated by a diversity of sources
in urban spaces, such as sensors, devices, vehicles, buildings, and
human, to tackle the major issues that cities face, e.g., air pollution,

https://doi.org/10.1145/3637528.3671477increased energy consumption and traffic congestion. Urban com-
puting connects unobtrusive and ubiquitous sensing technologies,
advanced data management and analytics models, and novel visu-
alization methods, to create win-win-win solutions that improve
urban environment, human life quality, and city operation systems,
as shown in Figure 1. Urban computing also helps us understand
the nature of urban phenomena and even predict the future of cities.
Urban computing is an interdisciplinary field fusing the computing
science with traditional fields, like transportation, civil engineering,
economy, ecology, and sociology, in the context of urban spaces.
The goals and framework of urban computing give rise to four
distinct challenges within the context of data mining:
•Adapt machine learning algorithms to spatial and spatio-
temporal data: Spatio-temporal data has unique properties, con-
sisting of spatial distance, spatial hierarchy, temporal smoothness,
period and trend, as compared to image and text data. How to
adapt existing machine learning algorithms to deal with spatio-
temporal properties remains a challenge.
•Combine machine learning algorithms with database tech-
niques: Machine learning and databases are two distinct fields
in computing science, having their own communities and confer-
ences. While people from these two communities barely talk to
each other, we do need knowledge from both sides when design-
ing data analytic methods for urban computing. The combination
is also imperative for other big data projects. It is a challenging
task for people from both communities to design effective and
efficient data analytics methods that seamlessly and organically
integrate the knowledge of databases and machine learning.
•Cross-domain knowledge fusion methods: While fusing
knowledge from multiple disparate datasets is imperative in a
big data project, cross-domain data fusion is a non-trivial task
given the following reasons. First, simply concatenating features
extracted from different datasets into a single feature vector may
compromise the performance of a task, as different data sources
may have very different feature spaces, distributions, and lev-
els of significance. Second, the more types of data involved in a
task, the more likely we could encounter a data-scarce problem.

For example, five data sources, consisting of traffic, meteorology,
POIs, road networks, and air quality readings, are used to predict
the fine-grained air quality throughout a city. When trying to
apply this method to other cities, however, we would find that
many cities cannot find enough data in each domain (e.g. do not
have enough monitoring stations to generate air quality data), or
may even not have the data of a domain (like traffic data) at all.
•Interactive visual data analytics: Data visualization is not
solely about displaying raw data and presenting results, though
these are common reasons for visualization. Interactive visual
data analytics is extremely important in urban computing, as
it combines visualization methods with data mining algorithms
and deployment on a cloud platform. Interactive visual data ana-
lytics empowers people to integrate domain knowledge, such as
urban planning, with data science, enabling domain experts to
collaborate with data scientists to solve real problems in cities.
The objective of this workshop is to provide professionals, re-
searchers, and technologists with a single forum where they can
discuss and share the state-of-the-art of the development and appli-
cations related to urban computing, present their ideas and contri-
butions, and set future directions in innovative research for urban
computing. Particularly, at KDD 2024, this workshop actively en-
courages submissions that seek to leverage foundational models or
large language models in the realms of sensing/mining/understanding
urban data to tackle challenges in cities and help better formulate
the future of cities. This workshop also well aligns with the topic of
KDD 2024, data mining for social good and sustainability.
