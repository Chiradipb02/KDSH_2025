ABSTRACT
Generating city-scale lane-level maps faces significant challenges
due to the intricate urban environments, such as blurred or absent
lane markings. Additionally, a standard lane-level map requires
a comprehensive organization of lane groupings, encompassing
lane direction, style, boundary, and topology, yet has not been
thoroughly examined in prior research. These obstacles result in
labor-intensive human annotation and high maintenance costs. This
paper overcomes these limitations and presents an industrial-grade
solution named DuMapNet that outputs standardized, vectorized
map elements and their topology in an end-to-end paradigm. To this
end, we propose a group-wise lane prediction (GLP) system that
outputs vectorized results of lane groups by meticulously tailoring a
transformer-based network. Meanwhile, to enhance generalization
in challenging scenarios, such as road wear and occlusions, as well
as to improve global consistency, a contextual prompts encoder
(CPE) module is proposed, which leverages the predicted results of
spatial neighborhoods as contextual information. Extensive experi-
ments conducted on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority and effectiveness of DuMapNet. Additionally, DuMap-
Net has already been deployed in production at Baidu Maps since
June 2023, supporting lane-level map generation tasks for over 360
cities while bringing a 95%reduction in costs. This demonstrates

1 INTRODUCTION
Lane-level map, as a crucial layer of the high-definition map, offers
critical prior information for autonomous driving, facilitating be-
yond visual line of sight (BVLOS) perception, path planning, and
decision-making with globally consistent road data. Specifically,
lane-level map models the real world within decimeter level. This
indicates that they not only depict the fundamental structure and
layout of roads but also provide lane-level details, including lane line
geometry, lane marking style, as well as connection topology, etc.
Building on this, lane-level navigation, a pioneering advancement
in precise travel guidance, has been extensively deployed to assist
public travel by providing detailed, high-precision map elements
and suggested routes (see Figure 1). Additionally, with its higher
precision and advanced route planning capabilities, lane-level map
will potentially benefit a wide range of geographical tasks, such as
geo-object change detection [36], traffic condition prediction [37],
estimated time of arrival prediction (ETA prediction, a.k.a., travel
time estimation) [ 4,5,11], and road extraction [ 38] at Baidu Maps.

Figure 1: DuMapNet introduces a learning-based methodol-
ogy for lane-level map vectorization. Our proposed method
incorporates a scheme based on contextual prompts and com-
ponents dedicated to group-wise lane prediction. With these
advancements, DuMapNet achieves cost-effective generation
of city-scale vectorized maps and significantly supports vari-
ous applications, such as lane-level navigation in Baidu Maps.
The task of lane-level map generation can be formulated as con-
structing and updating the core geographic elements that meet
lane-level precision, given abundant road data. These geographic el-
ements primarily include open-shape elements (e.g., lane lines, stop
lines, etc.) and closed-shape elements (e.g., crosswalks). Moreover,
as an efficient and standardized management unit in high-definition
map, lane group plays a crucial role in onboard navigation and au-
tonomous driving. It can be defined as a set of one or more lanes on
a road segment perpendicular to the direction of travel [ 15,29] (see
Figure 1). Within a lane group, the number of lanes remains con-
stant, and all lanes belong to the same road segment with the same
direction of travel. Given this definition, the lane group emerges as
an exceptionally convenient and efficient unit for driving guidance,
markedly improving vehicle interaction with urban environments.
Consequently, this paper introduces a learning-based solution that
directly generates final standardized results in an end-to-end man-
ner. This method effectively supersedes existing techniques that
rely on manual post-processing to construct lane groups.
Traditional map generation solutions are often costly and labor-
intensive as they require trained experts to manually annotate
geographic elements. To improve efficiency with less human effort,
leveraging advancements in computer vision for map generation
has become a viable approach. These algorithms can be roughly
categorized into segmentation-based methods [ 16,26,31], lane
detection-based methods [ 6,21], as well as vectorization-based
methods [ 18,23,40]. Specifically, segmentation-based methods are
suboptimal since they often require a series of post-processing
strategies, such as thinning and fitting, to convert mask into vec-
torized map. Lane detection-based methods are usually limited in
terms of extensibility and flexibility regarding map element types.
While the vectorization-based solutions have achieved commend-
able results, they still exhibit limitations in prediction accuracy,
post-processing logic and handling complex road scenarios, such
as road wear and vehicle occlusion. Moreover, such onboard ap-
proaches are often constrained by computational power and localconstruction patterns, preventing them from meeting the precision
and global consistency required for city-scale lane-level map.
To fully explore the paradigm of large-scale lane-level map gen-
eration, we propose an automatic industrial-grade offboard solution
termed DuMapNet. Given a bird’s-eye-view (BEV) image, DuMap-
Net can unify the modeling of polyline-style and polygon-style
map elements as a set of points. To significantly improve the pre-
diction results for difficult scenarios such as road wear, occlusions,
and complex intersections, as well as the connections of vectoriza-
tion results among frames, we propose the contextual prompts
encoder (CPE) module. By using the spatial prediction results
of the current BEV image’s neighborhood as prompt information,
CPE significantly enhances the geometric and category consistency
of the prediction results in a larger receptive field. To avoid the
error accumulation effect and weak generalization of traditional
multi-stage map-making methods, and considering the require-
ments for standardized map construction, we design a group-wise
lane prediction (GLP) to output the vectorized results of lane
groups through mutual constraints between lane group polygons
and lane lines, without the need for complex post-processing logic.
Finally, to achieve an end-to-end large-scale map generation mode,
we develop the topology prediction module, which predicts the
lane line topological relationships between BEV images, enabling
large-scale map correlation. Our key contributions to both the re-
search and industrial communities are as follows:
•Potential impact: We introduce DuMapNet, an end-to-end
vectorization modeling framework, as an industrial-grade
solution for city-scale lane-level map generation. DuMapNet
has been successfully deployed in production at Baidu Maps,
supporting lane-level map generation for over 360cities and
realizing a 95%reduction in costs.
•Novelty: DuMapNet represents a new paradigm for city-scale
lane-level map generation task, achieving end-to-end predic-
tions from bird’s-eye-view (BEV) images to vectorized results
that meet cartographic standards. The novelty lies in each
stage, from the unified vectorization modeling, the group-
wise lane prediction system, the contextual prompts encoder,
to the topology prediction module, making the lane-level map
generation task highly automatic and cost-effective.
•Technical quality: Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments are performed on large-scale, real-world datasets
collected from Baidu Maps, which demonstrate the superiority
of DuMapNet. The successful deployment of DuMapNet at
Baidu Maps further shows that it is a practical and robust
solution for city-scale lane-level map generation.

2.1 Preliminaries
The task of lane-level map generation from BEV image is defined
as follows: given a BEV image 𝐼collected from vehicle-mounted
sensors as input, the network is supposed to predict the vectorized
map elements 𝑉. Next, we will describe the data preparation and
unified vectorization.
Data Preparation. Different from most onboard methods that
operate on BEV features using multi-view images as input, follow-
ing [ 1,13], our offboard approach is built upon the BEV image

Figure 2: Overall architecture of DuMapNet. DuMapNet processes the entire city-scale land area using a sliding window approach.
For each local area, an image encoder is utilized to extract image features from the BEV image. Meanwhile, we propose a novel
Contextual Prompts Encoder (CPE) to encode the predictions of adjacent scanned areas. To achieve Group-wise Lane Prediction
(GLP), we meticulously tailor key network components, including the query, decoder, and prediction heads. Consequently, the
network is capable of generating a vectorized map, which encompasses vectorized elements and their topology. Additionally,
two auxiliary predictions are generated: the use of group polygons aids in the organization of lane groups, while foreground
segmentation enhances lane point localization. For detailed illustrations, please refer to Section 2.
produced using multi-view images, point cloud data, and vehicle
poses information. The advantages primarily lie in two aspects:
first, the regional global information can be fully utilized, such
as geometric smoothness constraints, semantic correlations, and
global precision consistency; second, conducting multi-trip data
collection can alleviate the inevitable challenges such as precision
bias and dynamic occlusion. Instead of appealing to heavy labeling
manpower, we solve the large-scale annotation problem using the
Baidu Map Database in an automatic fashion. Specifically, given
a BEV image 𝐼with𝐻×𝑊resolution, with the spatial resolution
4𝑐𝑚×4𝑐𝑚for each pixel, it covers 𝐻/25meters by𝑊/25meters
region with a certain geographic coordinate range. First, we in-
dex the instance geometries, labels, and lane group IDs within
that range from the database. Second, based on the lane group
IDs, the instance geometries are organized into a list format at the
granularity of lane groups and mapped to pixel coordinate system.
Simultaneously, we compute the minimum bounding rectangle of
all instances contained within each lane group to create the group
polygon. Finally, based on the spatial relationship between BEV
images, neighborhood IDs are added to the ground truth. For better
understanding, we have released a demo for reference on GitHub
at https://github.com/XiyanLiu/DuMapNet.
Unified Vectorization. We define a unified vectorized repre-
sentation for the core geographic elements in each local land area.
Formally, given a BEV image 𝐼, we denote the corresponding lane-
level vectorization as 𝑉={𝐺𝑖}𝑁𝑔
𝑖=0, where𝑁𝑔denotes the number
of the lane groups in the local land area. Each lane group 𝐺𝑖is
composed of a set of geographic elements 𝑃𝑗and element style
𝐶𝑗∈R𝑁𝑐𝑙𝑠, where𝐶𝑗is a one-hot vector with 𝑁𝑐𝑙𝑠element styles
in total. We thus denote a lane group as 𝐺={𝑃𝑗,𝐶𝑗}𝑁𝑙
𝑗=0, where
𝑁𝑙is the element number in a lane group. Next, the point set of
each element instance is denoted as 𝑃={𝑝𝑘}𝑁𝑝
𝑘=0, where𝑁𝑝is thenumber of the points and 𝑝𝑘∈R2denotes the coordinates of each
point.
2.2 Overall Architecture
The city-scale lane-level map generation is inherently complex,
requiring a comprehensive organization of lane groupings and ex-
isting methods only generate partial elements of lane groupings.
Meanwhile, DuMapNet is the first end-to-end solution to achieve
city-scale lane-level map generation, realizing practical and effec-
tive industrial gains.
Specifically, Figure 2 illustrates the overall architecture of our
proposed DuMapNet. To obtain a city-scale lane-level vectorized
map, DuMapNet processes the entire land area using a sliding
window approach following a zig-zag scan sequence. The model’s
inputs contain two parts: a BEV image and contextual prompts.
Specifically, the BEV image is obtained by the aforementioned data
preparation process, providing abundant appearance features of the
local land area. We employ an image encoder that contains a back-
bone network and a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to extract BEV
feature𝐹𝐼∈R384×384from the BEV image 𝐼. Meanwhile, to enable
spatial coherent lane-level vectorized predictions over adjacent land
areas, we propose to take the predicted vectorized map of adjacent
scanned areas as the additional input of DuMapNet. We further
tailor a contextual prompts encoder (CPE) to realize an effective
encoding for the predictions of adjacent scanned areas. Moreover,
we devise a query combination that contains a set of hierarchical
queries for lane line prediction, one foreground segmentation query,
and a set of queries for lane group polygon prediction. In the De-
coder, the proposed query combination interacts with both the BEV
feature and the contextual prompt embeddings derived from CPE.
Finally, we construct multiple tasking prediction heads to facili-
tate various predictions, where the predictions include vectorized

results for lane lines and the topology that indicates the connec-
tion of lane lines between different lane areas. Furthermore, we
propose two auxiliary predictions, where the group polygons are
adopted to facilitate lane group organization while the foreground
segmentation is to help improve lane point localization.
2.3 Contextual Prompts Encoder (CPE)
Inspired by the recent success of prompt-based vision models [ 12,
14,20], our proposed CPE adopts a simple yet effective architecture
to encode both the geometric and semantic information of the
vectorization results of adjacent land areas, providing contextual
cues for the vectorization of the current land area during the sliding
window operation. Formally, we define
𝐹𝑝=CPE({𝑉𝑠}𝑠∈𝐴) (1)
where𝐴denotes a set of adjacent land areas. 𝐹𝑝∈𝑅𝑀𝑔×𝑀𝑙×𝑁𝑝×256
denotes the prompt embeddings that interact with the features
of intermediate layers in the decoder. Where 𝑀𝑔,𝑀𝑙,𝑁𝑝denote
the number of total predicted groups, the number of element in-
stances in each group, and the number of points in each instance,
respectively.
The architecture of CPE is illustrated in Figure 2. Specifically, we
adopt a shared MLP (Multi-Layer Percseptron) network to encode
the predicted style type for each element to serve as the semantic
encoding. For the geometric information, we perform a shared po-
sitional encoding sub-network to the coordinates of element points.
This sub-network consists of sine and cosine functions with differ-
ent frequencies as well as a subsequent MLP. Finally, the geometric
and semantic cues are concatenated and then fed to an MLP, gener-
ating the final prompt embeddings 𝐹𝑝. Furthermore, we introduce
a memory mechanism into CPE to realize a long-term feature de-
pendence. Specifically, we adopt FIFO queue as a memory bank to
store the𝐹𝑝prompt embeddings of previous 𝑇frames of local land
areas. The memory bank efficiently stores prompt embeddings of
the remaining 𝑇−1neighboring frames. These embeddings are
then aggregated using a weighted sum operation within the CPE.
The weights assigned to each stored frame are learnable parameters
generated by intermediate layer in CPE, allowing the model to adap-
tively focus on relevant information. This design effectively reduces
noise in the prompted information (e.g. prompts may contain pre-
diction errors) while maintaining a lightweight architecture with
minimal computational overhead. The memory bank is the core
module of the CPE and directly reflects its performance. Finally, 𝐹𝑝
is obtained via learning an aggregation of the stored embeddings.
2.4 Group-wise Lane Prediction (GLP)
A lane group refers to a collection of lanes that share common
characteristics e.g.same style or are directed towards a common
goal or destination. Practically, lane groups are essential for path
planning and navigation as they help in understanding complex
road structures. However, predicting an accurate group-wise lane
is challenging since it demands sophisticated semantic analysis
and geometrical reasoning. Particularly, localizing the endpoint of
a lane instance requires the knowledge of the style and topology
changing of the other lanes in the same group. To address this,
we propose to use a polygon, namely group polygon to outlinethe boundary of a lane group. We further introduce an auxiliary
task in the network architecture to predict the group polygons.
Since all the points of the predicted map elements are located in the
group polygons, we propose an additional point-in-polygon loss to
facilitate group-wise lane prediction.
In this section, we introduce the key components regarding
to group-wise lane prediction (GLP), including the query design,
decoder architecture, and the prediction heads.
Queries. We design a query combination to flexibly encode
structured map information and perform hierarchical bipartite
matching for both map element and group polygon learning. Specif-
ically, we extend the hierarchical query scheme in MapTR [ 18]
and customize two set of queries, namely, element queries {𝑞𝑙
𝑖}𝑁𝑙
𝑖=0
and group polygon queries {𝑞𝑔
𝑖}𝑁𝑔
𝑖=0. These two types of queries
adopt the same hierarchical query scheme that efficiently encodes
instance-level and point-level information. Moreover, we introduce
an additional foreground-background (FG) query 𝑞𝑠for the auxil-
iary task of semantic segmentation.
Decoder. All map elements, group polygons, and segmentation
masks are simultaneously predicted using a unified Transformer
structure. The decoder is composed of several cascaded layers, each
incorporating a self-attention module, two cross-attention mod-
ules, and an intra-instance self-attention module. The initial self-
attention module is designed to enable hierarchical queries to ex-
change information across the entire feature space. The subsequent
cross-attention module facilitates interaction between hierarchical
queries and BEV features. To enhance prediction accuracy and spa-
tial consistency, an additional cross-attention module has been in-
novatively introduced, with contextual prompt embeddings serving
as input keys and values to interact with hierarchical queries. Lastly,
the intra-instance self-attention module allows for interactions be-
tween points within the same instance, thereby improving geomet-
ric smoothness. Ultimately, after processing through the decoder,
the hierarchical queries are effectively encoded into group-level
query embeddings 𝐹𝑔∈R𝑁𝑔×𝑁𝑝×256, line-level query embeddings
𝐹𝑙∈R𝑁𝑙×𝑁𝑝×256, and a foreground embedding 𝐹𝑠∈R1×𝑁𝑝×256.
Predictions. For predicting lane lines and lane group polygons,
we input both map element and group polygon query embeddings
into a shared classification branch and a shared regression branch
to facilitate type classification and geometric property regression,
respectively. For each predicted instance, the regression branch
outputs a vector of dimension R𝑁𝑝×2, representing the normalized
coordinates of 𝑁𝑝points.
Furthermore, to enhance the performance of the classification
and regression branches, thereby improving prediction accuracy
and accelerating training convergence, we propose a foreground
segmentation branch. Instead of directly utilizing the BEV features
for segmentation, an individual foreground query 𝑞𝑠𝑒𝑔∈R1×256is
introduced alongside the hierarchical queries. Following process-
ing by the conventional decoder network and MLP encoding, the
foreground query embedding interacts with the BEV feature to
generate a segmentation map.
2.5 Topology Prediction
Considering our objective to generate city-scale lane-level map
in an end-to-end manner, it is insufficient to solely predict the

vectorization of single-frame BEV images. Predicting the topolog-
ical relationships between frames is indispensable for our task.
To address this, we propose to directly predict a topology matrix
M∈ R𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑠×𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑠which indicates the connections between 𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑠
element instances in current land area and 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑠element instances
in the contextual land areas.
Inspired by [35], we formulate topology prediction as a classifi-
cation task, where the topology matrix is produced as an additional
output of the decoder. The architecture is outlined in Figure 2 and
specified in Figure 3. Specifically, we adopt a similar sub-network
as the CPE to encoder the predicted map elements, producing an
embedding𝐹𝑒∈R𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑠×𝑁𝑝×256that encapsulate both the predicted
coordinates and class information of instances. Subsequently, we
calculate the correlation of 𝐹𝑒and the prompt embeddings 𝐹𝑝than
adopt a MLP to produce the topology matrix. During inference,
lane lines and lane group polygons are aggregated based on their
geometric relationships, facilitating the generation of coherent lane
group configurations.
2.6 End-to-End Training
In the training stage, for each frame, we apply the hierarchical
matching scheme in MapTR [ 18] to obtain pairs of the map-elements
predictions and the ground truths, denoted as {ˆ𝑃𝑙
𝑖,𝑃𝑙
𝑖}. Meanwhile,
we adopt the same matching scheme to obtain pairs of the predicted
group polygons and the ground truths, denoted as {ˆ𝑃𝑔
𝑗,𝑃𝑔
𝑗}.
Based on the matching results and the correspondence between
map elements and their group polygons, we employ multiple task-
specific losses to train our proposed DuMapNet in an end-to-end
manner:
L=𝛼L𝑙+𝛽L𝑡+𝜆L𝑔+𝜂L𝑔𝑙+𝜇L𝑠 (2)
whereL𝑙,L𝑡denotes the loss for learning map element and topol-
ogy, respectively. Besides, L𝑔denotes the loss for learning group
polygons whileL𝑔𝑙is an additional point-in-polygon loss to fa-
cilitate group-wise elements organization. Finally, we introduce a
foreground segmentation loss L𝑠to enhance lane point localiza-
tion.𝛼,𝛽,𝜆,𝜂,𝜇 are hyperparameters that strike a balance between
difference losses. Next, we provide detailed illustrations for each
type of loss function.
Map Elements Learning. For each map element instance, we
employ aligned Focal Loss L𝑐𝑙𝑠for style classification and an L1
regression lossL𝐿1for point localization, respectively. Here we
follow MapTR [ 18] and further apply a direction loss L𝑑𝑖𝑟to alignthe direction of the predicted lane segments with the ground truth.
The loss for training the map elements is thus denoted as:
L𝑙=L𝑐𝑙𝑠+L𝑟𝑒𝑔+L𝑑𝑖𝑟 (3)
Furthermore, inspired by Stable DINO [ 22], we adapt the aligned
Focal Loss to enhance the alignment between classification score
and localization quality in L𝑐𝑙𝑠. As shown in Equation. (4), L1
distance of the 𝑖-th matched pairs between prediction ˆ𝑃𝑙
𝑖and corre-
sponding ground truth 𝑃𝑙
𝑖is used as a positional metric to supervise
the training probabilities of positive examples. The classification
loss is thus formulated as:
L𝑐𝑙𝑠=𝑁𝑝𝑜𝑠∑︁
𝑖=1(|𝑑𝑖−𝑠𝑖|𝛾)𝐵𝐶𝐸(𝑠𝑖,𝑑𝑖)+𝑁𝑛𝑒𝑔∑︁
𝑖=1𝑠𝛾
𝑖𝐵𝐶𝐸(𝑠𝑖,0) (4)
𝑑𝑖=||ˆ𝑃𝑙
𝑖−𝑃𝑙
𝑖||1 (5)
where𝑠𝑖is the probability for the 𝑖-th predicted map element. 𝑁𝑝𝑜𝑠
and𝑁𝑛𝑒𝑔denote the number of positive and negative elements,
respectively. Moreover, as for L𝑡, we apply the same loss function
asL𝑙for learning group polygons.
Topology Learning. We define the topological relationship as
a 2-class classification task i.e.connected or not. As the number of
connected ones is significantly less than the number of unconnected
ones, we apply a focal loss to supervise the topological association
matrix prediction.
Group-guided Auxiliary Supervision. We leverage the group
polygons to provide auxiliary supervision for learning high-quality
group-wise lane lines. Specifically, this auxiliary supervision is
designed based on the following observations: all the points of
the lane lines should be located inside or on the boundary of their
corresponding group polygons. We thus propose a point-in-polygon
loss as:
L𝑔𝑙(ˆ𝑃𝑙
𝑖,𝑃𝑔
𝑗)=∑︁
𝑝∈ˆ𝑃𝑙
𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑑
𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒 𝑃𝑔
𝑗𝐷(𝑝,𝑃𝑔
𝑗) (6)
where𝐷(𝑝,𝑃𝑔
𝑗)is the closest distance from point 𝑝to any edge of
the lane group polygon 𝑃𝑔
𝑗. During the training stage, we adopt the
ground-truth group polygons to punish predicted points located
outside their group polygon. During the inference stage, we sim-
ply employ the predicted group polygons to check map elements’
locations.
Segmentation-guided Auxiliary Supervision. To improve
the accuracy of vectorized predictions, we choose a combination of
Binary Cross Entropy and Dice loss to calculate the loss between
the predicted foreground mask 𝐹𝑠∈𝑅𝐻×𝑊and the ground truth
mask𝐹𝑚∈𝑅𝐻×𝑊generated from ground truth lane lines:
L𝑠=𝐵𝐶𝐸(𝐹𝑠,𝐹𝑚)+L𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑒(𝐹𝑠,𝐹𝑚) (7)
3 EXPERIMENTS
3.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets. As aforementioned, DuMapNet has been deployed at
Baidu Maps, supporting over 360cities. To evaluate the effectiveness
of DuMapNet, we have collected a large-scale real-world dataset,
6019KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Deguo Xia et al.
DuLD, consisting of bird’s-eye view (BEV) images and ground truth
data from six cities: Beijing, Guangzhou, Changchun, Changzhou,
Chongqing, and Leshan. These cities were chosen for their var-
ied urban scales and geographic features. The dataset from Bei-
jing, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Changzhou was divided into a
training set and a validation set in a 9 : 1 ratio. Meanwhile, data
from Chongqing and Leshan were used as the test set to evaluate
the model’s performance. Statistically, DuLD contains 134,524im-
ages, spanning 8,072kilometers, with each image at a resolution
of1536×1536 pixels. More details can be found in Table 1. Impor-
tantly, to investigate the benefits of larger-scale data, we introduce
DuLD-L, a dataset with one million paired images and correspond-
ing ground truths, and evaluate DuMapNet’s performance on this
expanded dataset.
Evaluation Metrics. We adopt recall (R) and precision (P) to
assess the quality of map construction at the instance level. The
evaluation considers category consistency, endpoint distance, and
overlap to determine if a pair of lane instances from ground truth
and prediction match. Moreover, category consistency and IoU
(𝐼𝑜𝑈>0.5) are used for closed-shape elements such as crosswalks.
Specifically, category consistency mandates that the instances be-
long to the same category. Endpoint distance requires the L2 dis-
tance between the start points and end points of the instances
should be less than 3 meters, respectively. Overlap considers the
parallel distance between instances. When calculating overlap, both
prediction instances and ground truth are first divided into multi-
ple segments with 1-meter intervals. Then, the projection distance
between segments is calculated. If the proportion of segments with
projection distance smaller than the threshold 𝑑={0.5,1}𝑚ex-
ceeds the threshold 𝑟={0.5,0.8}, the prediction instance will be
considered as true positive (TP). In the following experiments, we
use𝑅@𝑃𝑑,𝑟=𝑝to represent the recall at 𝑝precision with threshold
𝑑and𝑟. Lower values of threshold 𝑑and higher values of threshold
𝑟signify more stringent precision requirements.
Implementation Details. Our model is trained using 16 NVIDIA
Tesla V100 GPUs, with a batch size of 16. The AdamW [ 24] optimizer
is employed with a weight decay of 0.01 and the initial learning
rate is set to 6×10−4with cosine decay. The input images have
a resolution of 768×768pixels. For our architecture, we employ
ResNet50 [ 8] and HRNet48 [ 34] as backbones. The default number
of instance queries, point queries and decoder layers are 50,50and
6, respectively. As for hyper-parameters of loss weight, we set 𝛼,𝛽,
𝜆,𝜂and𝜇to1,1,0.2,0.15and100, respectively. The inference time
is measured on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with batch size 1.
3.2 Evaluation
Comparison with Baselines. We compare our DuMapNet with
segmentation-based method [ 32] and other vectorization-based
methods [ 18,40]. As shown in Table 2, vectorization-based methods
achieve better results without complex post-processing logic. In
particular, our DuMapNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art
method by a large margin ( +2.66%when𝑃1,0.8=90%) under the
same setting of ResNet50, indicating the effectiveness of our method.
Surprisingly, our method achieves a further improvement of 4.99%
by replacing the backbone with HRNet48 to obtain enhanced feature
representation. Furthermore, our method achieves 73.28%recall onTable 1: Statistics of DuLD dataset.

one million of training data, demonstrating that as the training data
volume increases, our method can achieve greater advantages.
The quantitative comparisons of different evaluation thresh-
olds are summarized in Table 3. From the results, we observe that
DuMapNet consistently brings significant improvements. Taking
𝑅@𝑃0.5,0.8=90%as an example, DuMapNet achieves better perfor-
mance with+3.00%∼5.04%recall gains on DuLD, which under-
scores our method’s ability to achieve superior geometric precision
and maintain category consistency. Particularly, as the projection
distance decreases, the performance of all approaches experiences
a significant decline, yet our DuMapNet shows a slighter drop, in-
dicating that our method is more robust and maintains superior
performance at higher precision levels.
Ablation Studies. In this section, extensive ablation studies
are conducted to systematically evaluate the key designs of our
DuMapNet. As shown in Table 4, Group I is the baseline without
a series of designs. From Group I and II, it is proved that adding
the task-aligned supervision can bring slight improvements by fos-
tering better synergy between geometric learning and category
identification. Further analysis between Groups II and III reveals
that incorporating intra-instance self-attention results in a 0.99
improvement under 𝑃1,0.8=95%. The transition from Group III
to Group IV examines the impact of adding segmentation-guided
auxiliary supervision, showing marked improvements in all metrics,
especially at higher precision levels. This outcome is expected as
the segmentation branch contributes to more fine-grained pixel-
level modeling, enhancing semantic understanding and refining
prediction accuracy. The results from Group V highlight the sig-
nificant role of the proposed contextual prompts encoder (CPE)
module, showing a notable increase of 2.74% in recall at a high
accuracy level ( 𝑃1,0.8=95%). These findings demonstrate that CPE,
by leveraging spatial prediction results from the area surrounding
the current BEV image, significantly enhances the geometric and
category consistency of predictions across a broader receptive field.
Analysis of generalization. To further demonstrate the gen-
eralization of our method, five cities are additionally selected as
the test set. These cities are distributed across various regions,
such as Harbin in northeastern China and Xi’an in northwestern
China, and exhibit diverse sizes, with Shanghai being a large first-
tier city, while Zhongshan is a second-tier city. Finally, a total
of5,000images were collected for evaluation. The experimental
results are presented in Table 5. On the one hand, DuMapNet out-
performs the existing state-of-the-art methods on all city test sets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. On the other hand,
DuMapNet shows superior generalization with less fluctuation in

3.3 Visualization
Qualitative results from the DuLD dataset are presented in Figure 4
and Figure 5. DuMapNet not only performs well in simple scenes
but also predicts high-quality vectorized map elements in complex
scenarios like intersections, road wear and occlusions. As shownin Figure 4, DuMapNet exhibits significant advantages in terms of
lane recall, lane accuracy, and endpoint accuracy. For example, as
demonstrated in the second row of Figure 4, DuMapNet precisely
captures both the geometry and category of lane lines in occlu-
sion scenes, avoiding unnecessary lane line predictions. In addition,
Figure 5 provides a visual comparison that underscores the effective-
ness of group-guided supervision in enabling accurate prediction of
endpoint positions, even in scenarios with subtle visual differences,
such as the dashed line and the segment of solid line. Group-guided

Here we briefly review the closely related work in the fields of map
construction and lane detection.
6022DuMapNet: An End-to-End Vectorization System for City-Scale Lane-Level Map Generation KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain.
4.1 Map Construction
With the development of deep learning and BEV perception [ 10],
map construction is transitioning from a labor-intensive annotation
task to a model-based dense prediction challenge. Segmentation-
based methods [ 7,9,17,25,26] generate rasterized map by perform-
ing BEV semantic segmentation. To build vectorized maps, HDMap-
Net [ 16] adopts a two-stage approach of segmentation followed by
post-processing to generate vectorized instances. As the first end-
to-end framework, VectorMapNet [ 23] utilizes an auto-regressive
decoder to predict points sequentially. MapTR [ 18] proposes a uni-
fied shape modeling method based on a parallel end-to-end frame-
work, which has been followed by many works [ 3,27,28]. MapVR
[39] applies differentiable rasterization to vectorized outputs to
performs precise and geometry-aware supervision. MapTRv2 [ 19]
further introduces auxiliary one-to-many matching and auxiliary
dense supervision to speedup convergence. BeMapNet [ 27] adopts a
parameterized paradigm and constructs map elements as piecewise
Bezier curves. PivotNet [ 3] utilizes a dynamic number of pivotal
points to model map elements, preventing the loss of essential de-
tails. Different from the existing works, our proposed DuMapNet
leverages neighboring map elements as prompts to guide the gen-
eration of map elements in the current frame, which can enhance
the spatial consistency of the map elements.
4.2 Lane Detection
Lane detection plays a critical role in detecting lane elements in
road scenes and can be considered as a subtask of map construction.
LaneATT [ 30] utilizes an anchor-based deep lane detection model.
CondLaneNet [ 21] adopts a conditional lane detection model based
on conditional convolution and row-wise formulation. GANet [ 33]
formulates lane detection as a keypoint estimation and association
problem. BezierLaneNet [ 6] proposes a parametric Bezier curve-
based method, which can model the geometric shapes of lane lines.
PersFormer [ 2] utilizes a transformer-based spatial feature transfor-
mation module and unify 2D and 3D lane detection simultaneously.
Different from these methods that primarily focus on lane elements,
our proposed DuMapNet models map elements in a unified vec-
torized form, which can detect open-shape map elements such as
lanes, as well as closed-shape elements like crosswalks.
5 DISCUSSION
Before the deployment of DuMapNet, Baidu Maps relied heavily on
labor-intensive manual annotation processes that involved segmen-
tation techniques and complex post-processing logic. This approach
significantly increased operational costs and decreased efficiency.
With the introduction of DuMapNet, now operational in over 360
cities, production efficiency has seen a twenty-fold improvement,
leading to a remarkable 95%reduction in costs.
Despite DuMapNet’s impressive achievements, several challeng-
ing issues remain unresolved and require further investigation. For
instance, the model struggles in scenarios with extensive static
obstructions, such as long stretches of road with parked vehicles.
Such conditions disrupt performance because the lack of visible
road surface markings compromises the effectiveness of the con-
textual prompts encoder. To address this challenge, integratingmulti-source data may be an effective approach. In addition, gen-
erating qualified map data from low-precision sources, such as
crowdsourced data, presents an intriguing challenge that merits
deeper exploration in future work. Currently, leveraging the high
timeliness, broad coverage, and low cost of crowdsourced data for
map updates represents a more reasonable paradigm. For example,
crowdsourced data can provide timely updates for elements with
lower accuracy requirements, such as style changes, or for dynamic
changes like construction or temporary road closures.
6 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we present an effective industrial solution for city-
scale lane-level map generation. Specifically, we reformulate this
task as a vectorization modeling task that takes bird’s-eye-view
(BEV) images as input and outputs standardized, vectorized map
elements and their topology in an end-to-end paradigm. We pioneer
organize the lane group using a learning-based methodology and
address it through the proposed group-wise lane prediction (GLP)
system that outputs vectorized results of lane groups by applying
mutual constraints between lane group polygons and lane lines,
thereby eliminating the need for intricate post-processing logic.
To improve the generalization in challenging scenarios, such as
road wear and occlusions, as well as to improve the continuity
of vectorization results across frames, we present the contextual
prompts encoder (CPE) module, which leverages the spatial predic-
tion results from the surrounding area of the current BEV image as
contextual information. Extensive experiments conducted on the
collected large-scale real-world dataset from Baidu Maps demon-
strate the superiority of DuMapNet. The successful deployment
of DuMapNet at Baidu Maps has significantly improved its perfor-
mance. Since its launch in June 2023, DuMapNet served over 360
cities while bringing a 95%reduction in costs.
