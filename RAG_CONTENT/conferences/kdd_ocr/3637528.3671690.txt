ABSTRACT
Large-scale vision-language (V-L) models have demonstrated re-
markable generalization capabilities for downstream tasks through
prompt tuning. However, the mechanisms behind the learned text
representations are unknown, limiting further generalization gains,
and the limitations are more severe when faced with the prevalent
class imbalances seen in web-sourced datasets. Recent advances
in the neural collapse (NC) phenomenon of vision-only models
suggest that the optimal representation structure is the simplex
ETF, which paves the way to study representations in V-L models.
In this paper, we make the first attempt to use NC for examining the
representations in V-L models via prompt tuning. It is found that
NC optimality of text-to-image representations shows a positive
correlation with downstream generalizability, which is more severe
under class imbalance settings. To improve the representations, we
propose Neural-collapse-anchored Prompt Tuning (NPT), a novel
method that learns prompts with text and image representations
that satisfy the same simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF). NPT
incorporates two regularization terms: language-modality collapse
and multi-modality isomorphism; and it is compatible with other
prompt tuning methods. Extensive experiments show that NPT can
consistently help to improve existing prompt tuning techniques
across 11 datasets for both balanced and imbalanced settings.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recent advancements in the realm of large-scale vision-language
(V-L) pre-trained models such as CLIP [28], have emerged as a
promising alternative for visual representation learning. Drawing
strength from millions of image-text data sourced from the web,
these models proficiently align textual and visual modalities. Their
prowess, anchored in the diverse and rich content of the web, man-
ifests in robust performance on a variety of downstream tasks,
notably in challenges like zero-shot image recognition [46].
However, in real-world scenarios, especially in web-centric do-
mains like e-commerce, health informatics, or social media analyt-
ics, models often encounter previously unseen classes [2,4,19,38].
Considering deploying a pre-trained model like CLIP in a dynamic
e-commerce website, and it is continuously updated with new prod-
ucts from various web sources. Recent studies have highlighted the
inherent limitations of V-L models when adapting to such rapidly
changing environments [10,45]. Given the impracticality of retrain-
ing the model for each new product, many studies have turned
to soft prompt tuning as an approach to address these limitations
without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning [10,45]. Soft
prompt tuning enhances the generalization abilities of V-L models
by freezing their core parameters and exclusively refining learnable

prompts using a limited dataset. Building on CoOp [46]that models
context words in prompts as learnable vectors, recent studies have
introduced various techniques to enhance the generalization by
prompt tuning, including generating instance-specific prompt [45]
and integrating additional vision-modality prompt [10, 36].
While current soft prompt tuning methods have made strides in
enhancing generalization, they often fall short when confronted
with the diverse and imbalanced nature of novel classes in real-
world scenarios. A closer look reveals that while these techniques
make adjustments to text representations, they often overlook the
core alignment mechanisms between text and image modalities,
especially in the presence of diverse new classes. This superficial
alignment, devoid of deeper understanding, can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Therefore, in this paper, we delve into: (1) What truly
characterizes effective text and image representations in V-L models,
especially when faced with novel and imbalance classes? (2) How can
we harness these insights to achieve robust and aligned representations
within the embedding space?
An emerging discovery called neural collapse phenomenon [13,
27,34]in the vision-only models has shed light on the opti-
mal structure of visual feature representations. This phenomenon
demonstrates that the features just before feeding the classifier
(termed ‘last-layer features’) within the same class collapse to their
within-class mean after the model reaches zero training loss on
a sufficient and balanced dataset. Additionally, the within-class
means and their corresponding classifier vectors converge to the
vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). The simplex
ETF depicts the geometric structure of several vectors that have
maximal pairwise angles and equal norms [27].
It inspires us to examine the text representation geometries in
the prompt tuning of vision-language models through the lens
of neural collapse. After tuning prompts on a balanced dataset,
text representations in vision-language models serve the same
role as classifier vectors do in vision-only models, and tend to
approximate the ETF structure, as evident in Fig. 1 (a-b). Intuitively,
the text representations of MaPLe (the current SOTA method) are
closer to the simplex ETF structure (i.e., with evenly maximal angles
and equal norms) and are more aligned with the image represen-
tations than ZSCLIP, and MaPLe’s base-to-novel generalization ismuch better than ZSCLIP. We suppose that: A better neural col-
lapse phenomenon of text-to-image representations indicates better
generalizability of prompt-tuned CLIP.
It is further validated by our empirical analysis in Fig. 2 (a). It is
suggested that two metrics indicative of the ETF structure (further
elaborated in Sec 4.1) exhibit a proportional correlation with CLIP’s
base-to-novel generalization performances across several prompt
tuning methods. Our analysis connects the text-to-image represen-
tations of CLIP with the neural collapse phenomenon and unveils
the mechanism behind the generalizability of prompt tuning.
Building on the findings, we further delve into a more practical
setting where the downstream dataset is class imbalanced [11,18,
20,31,41,42,48,49]. The class imbalance indicates that popular cat-
egories (or head classes) often dominate the dataset with numerous
instances, while niche categories (or tail classes) are sparsely rep-
resented, which is prevalent in real-world scenarios. For instance,
in an e-commerce site, while there might be thousands of listings
for popular electronics, unique artisanal crafts might have only
a handful. This imbalance can skew minor class representations
and disturb the simplex ETF. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 (c), minor
class text representations exhibit a tendency to cluster closely, a
behavior that impairs the model’s capacity for generalization. This
degradation of performance is further corroborated by the empiri-
cal evidence presented in Fig. 2 (b). To address the challenge, we
propose a novel method called Neural-collapse-anchored Prompt
Tuning (NPT), which aims to optimize prompts so that both text
representations and image representations satisfy the same simplex
ETF structure. Specifically, we introduce two regularization terms
to the existing prompt tuning techniques. NPT considerably en-
hances the generalizability of V-L models in both class-imbalanced
and balanced scenarios.
We summarize the contributions as follows:
•To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to extend the neural
collapse phenomenon to V-L models and provide insights into
the underlying representation mechanism of prompt tuning on
CLIP’s generalization ability.
•We further explore the impact of class imbalance on the gener-
alization performance of V-L models, addressing a critical gap

prove CLIP’s generalization ability under both class balance and
imbalance scenarios.
•Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical experi-
ments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of NPT combined with
existing prompt tuning approaches, showcasing its significant
improvements in generalization.
Our takeaway insights of the neural collapse are below:
•A higher degree of neural collapse in text-to-image representa-
tions is indicative of stronger generalizability. This is pivotal in
explaining how soft prompt tuning enhances CLIP’s generaliza-
tion capability.
•Prompt tuning on an imbalanced dataset will disturb the text-
to-image representations from neural collapse, thus, hurting the
generalization. Neural-collapse-anchored approaches are needed
to improve the representations.
2 RELATED WORK
Vision-Language Models. As research into attention mechanism
and other methodologies advances [21–25], large language models
have achieved remarkable progress. The fusion of language supervi-
sion with natural images has garnered significant attention within
the computer vision community. These V-L models, as opposed
to those solely based on image supervision, encode rich language-
driven visual multi-modal representations. Recent V-L models such
as CLIP [28], ALIGN [9], LiT [40], FILIP [37], and Florence [39]have
showcased remarkable performance across a diverse range of tasks,
including few-shot and zero-shot visual recognition. These mod-
els learn joint image-language representations by self-supervised
training on vast amounts of web data.
Prompt Learning. Prompt learning indicates that prompts can be
learned automatically for a downstream task during the fine-tuning
stage. This technique was first used in NLP [12,14,16,43]followed
by the adaptation in V-L [5,45–47]. CoOp [46]fine-tunes CLIP
for few-shot transfer learning by optimizing a continuous set of
prompt vectors at its language branch. CoCoOp [45]highlights
the inferior performance of CoOp on novel classes and solves thegeneralization issue by explicitly conditioning prompts on image
instances. UPL [7]optimizes the language prompts in an unsuper-
vised fashion. [17]proposes to optimize multiple sets of prompts by
learning the prompts distribution. [1]perform visual prompt tuning
on CLIP by prompting on the vision branch. MaPLe [26]proposes
multi-modal prompts in both language and vision branches of CLIP.
Neural Collapse. In[27], neural collapse was observed in a lin-
ear classification model trained on a balanced dataset that expe-
riences a phenomenon where the last-layer features collapse into
within-class centers during the final stage of training. Since then,
researchers have endeavored to understand this phenomenon theo-
retically [3,8,30,32,50]. Recent studies have attempted to induce
it in imbalanced learning [29,33,34], incremental learning [35],
semantic segmentation [44], and federated learning [6,15]. How-
ever, these investigations into neural collapse are limited to linear
classifiers. In this work, we explore the presence of such a solution
in V-L models and propose NPT to improve the generalizability of
V-L models through prompt tuning.
3 PRELIMINARIES
3.1 Prompt Tuning in V-L models
CLIP comprises a vision-modality image encoder 𝐺𝑣:R𝑤×ℎ×3→
R𝑑and a language-modality text encoder 𝐺𝑙:R𝑚×𝑑𝑒→R𝑑. The
image encoder 𝐺𝑣converts a 3-channel image xwith shape𝑤×ℎ
into a𝑑-dimensional image representation z∈R𝑑. Meanwhile,
the text encoder 𝐺𝑙generates a 𝑑-dimensional text representation
𝒈𝑘∈R𝑑from𝑚-words𝑑𝑒-dimensional text input t𝑘, where𝑘∈
{1,...,𝐾}and𝐾is the number of classes. Note that both zand𝒈𝑘
areℓ2normalized vectors. Two encoders are jointly trained using a
contrastive loss that maximizes the cosine similarity of matched
pairs and minimizes that of the unmatched pairs.
Prompt engineering adapts the pre-trained CLIP to perform
zero-shot recognition without fine-tuning the model. Denote V=
{class𝑘}𝐾
𝑘=1as a class name set, the text input for CLIP is obtained
by extending [class𝑘]using a template like t𝑘=“a photo of a [class𝑘]′′.
The corresponding text representation 𝒈𝑘is obtained by feeding
4633KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Didi Zhu et al.
the prompt into the text encoder 𝐺𝑙, while the image representa-
tionzof the image xis extracted by the image encoder 𝐺𝑣. The
prediction task is defined as the classification of an image into one
of𝐾categories, which are represented by the set 𝑦∈{1,...,𝐾}.
Soft prompt learning replaces the hand-crafted prompts with
learnable prompts. CoOp [46]and CoCoOp [45]incorporate 𝑏learn-
able tokens{u1,..., u𝑏}for modeling text prompts, whereas MaPLe
[26]extends the approach by introducing an additional set of 𝑏
learnable tokens{v1,..., v𝑏}to model vision prompts. Denote 𝒄𝑘
as the word embedding of the 𝑘-th class name, the text prompt of
𝑘-th class is formulated as t𝑘={u1,..., u𝑏,𝒄𝑘}. For an image x, its
visual prompt is represented as f={v1,..., v𝑏,x}. Therefore, the
probability that xbelongs to the 𝑘-th class can be expressed as:
𝑝soft(𝑦=𝑘|x)=exp(⟨𝐺𝑣(f),𝐺𝑙(t𝑘)⟩/𝜆)
Í𝐾
𝑖=1exp(⟨𝐺𝑣(f),𝐺𝑙(t𝑖)⟩/𝜆). (1)
Note that the prediction probability can be represented by replacing
𝐺𝑣(f)with𝐺𝑣(x)=zin hand-crafted prompt engineering and
language-only prompt tuning.
3.2 Neural Collapse in Linear Classifier
Neural collapse describes that, at the terminal training phase, the
within-class means together with the linear classifier vectors will
collapse to the vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF),
which is defined as follows.
Definition 1 (Simplex Eqiangular Tight Frame). Consider
a set of vectors m𝑖∈R𝑑, with𝑖=1,···,𝐾, and𝑑≥𝐾−1. This
collection of vectors forms a simplex equiangular tight frame which
requires:
𝑴=√︂
𝐾
𝐾−1u
𝑰𝐾−1
𝐾1𝐾1𝑇
𝐾
, (2)
where 𝑴=[m1,···,m𝐾]∈R𝑑×𝐾,u∈R𝑑×𝐾allows a rotation and
satisfies u𝑇u=𝑰𝐾,𝑰𝐾is the identity matrix, and 1𝐾is an all-ones
vector. All vectors in a simplex ETF have an equal ℓ2norm and the
same pair-wise angle, i.e.,
m𝑇
𝑖m𝑗=𝐾
𝐾−1𝛿𝑖,𝑗−1
𝐾−1,∀𝑖,𝑗∈[𝐾], (3)
where𝛿𝑖,𝑗equals to 1 when 𝑖=𝑗and 0 otherwise. The pair-wise angle
−1
𝐾−1is the maximal equiangular separation of 𝐾vectors in R𝑑[27].
Denote z𝑘,𝑖as the last-layer image representation of the 𝑖-th
sample in the 𝑘-th class, the prototype z𝑘=Avg𝑖{z𝑘,𝑖}is the mean
value of the features in the 𝑘-th class, 𝒘𝑘is the classifier vector
of the𝑘-th class. We define three properties instructed by neural
collapse in vision-only models below:
Feature Collapse: For any 𝑘∈{1,...,𝐾}, the last-layer features in
the𝑘-th class collapse to their prototype, i.e., the 𝑘-th within-class
covariance Σ𝑘→0, where Σ𝑘:=Avg𝑘,𝑖n z𝑘,𝑖−z𝑘  z𝑘,𝑖−z𝑘𝑇o
andAvg{·}indicates the average operation.
Prototype Collapse: For any 𝑘∈{1,...,𝐾}, the normalized pro-
totypes converge to a simplex ETF, i.e., ˜z𝑘=(z𝑘−z𝐺)/∥z𝑘−z𝐺∥,
satisfies Eq. 3, where z𝐺is the global mean of the last-layer features,
i.e.,z𝐺=Avg𝑘,𝑖{z𝑘,𝑖}.Classifier Collapse: For any 𝑘∈{1,...,𝐾}, the normalized classi-
fier vectors converge to the same simplex ETF as prototypes, i.e.,
˜𝒘𝑘=𝒘𝑘/∥𝒘𝑘∥=z𝑘, satisfies Eq. 3.
4 METHOD
4.1 Explore Neural Collapse in CLIP
The intriguing neural collapse (NC) phenomenon has primarily
been observed and examined in vision-only models. In this paper,
we investigate the corresponding structures in the vision-language
model CLIP, a model that performs recognition by evaluating simi-
larities between text and image representations. In consideration of
the multi-modality aspect of the V-L model, we design two evalua-
tion criteria during training to assess the presence of neural collapse
phenomena in the V-L model. The definitions are as follows:
Definition 2 (Language-modality Collapse Degree). Given
a text encoder 𝐺𝑙(·), the language-modality collapse degree (LCD) of
text representations is given by
ΔLCD=Avg𝑖≠𝑗
⟨𝐺𝑙(t𝑖),𝐺𝑙(t𝑗)⟩−𝐸𝑊·𝜇	
,
s.t.∥𝐺𝑙(t𝑖)∥2≤𝐸𝑊,∀1≤𝑖≤𝐾,
where𝜇=−1
𝐾−1,t𝑖,t𝑗are text prompts of 𝐺𝑙(·)and√𝐸𝑊is the
fixed length constraint for text representations.
Definition 3 (Multi-modality Isomorphism Degree). Given
a text encoder 𝐺𝑙(·)and an image encoder 𝐺𝑣(·), the multi-modality
isomorphism degree (MID) is given by
ΔMID=Avg𝑘,𝑖n
⟨𝐺𝑣(f𝑘,𝑖),𝐺𝑙(t𝑘)⟩−√︁
𝐸𝑊·𝐸𝐻o
,
s.t.∥𝐺𝑙(t𝑖)∥2≤𝐸𝑊,∀1≤𝑖≤𝐾,
𝐺𝑣(f𝑘,𝑖)2≤𝐸𝐻,∀1≤𝑘≤𝐾,1≤𝑖≤𝑛𝑘,
where f𝑘,𝑖is the image input of x𝑖in the𝑘-th class and 𝑛𝑘is the
number of samples belonging to the 𝑘-th class.√𝐸𝐻is the fixed length
constraint for image features.
Remark 1. ΔLCDmeasures the degree of separation among text
representations (equivalent to classification vectors in vision-only mod-
els), reflecting the proximity between the language-modality structure
and the simplex ETF. ΔMIDcharacterizes the discrepancy between
the image representation and its text representation, reflecting the
alignment degree of language- and vision-modality structure. Lower
ΔLCDandΔMIDindicate that text and image representations are more
aligned and closer to the same simplex ETF.
As illustrated in Fig. 2, we analyzed the variations in ΔLCDand
ΔMIDvalues across different class distributions on the base-to-novel
task. The reported values represent the average across 11 datasets.
Furthermore, we visualize the neural collapse degree for the novel
classes on the EuroSAT dataset, as depicted in Fig. 1. Under balanced
training data conditions, the current SOTA prompt tuning method
MaPLe exhibits relatively low ΔLCDandΔMIDvalues compared
with ZSCLIP and other methods. This suggests a clear correlation
between these values and model accuracy. However, when encoun-
tering imbalanced training data, an observable increase in both
values is detected, leading to a subsequent decline in accuracy. We
can deduce that: (1) a higher degree of neural collapse, i.e., smaller
values of ΔLCDandΔMID, leads to stronger generalizability, and

Figure 3: Overview of Neural-collapse-anchored Prompt Tuning (NPT). NPT capitalizes on the benefits of two distinct regu-
larizers: LC Regularizer LLC, which controls the increase in ΔLCDand fosters the generation of more discriminative textual
representations; and MI Regularizer LMI, which promotes enhanced multi-modal alignment to address challenges and attain a
reduced ΔMID.
(2) data imbalance during training disrupts the neural collapse de-
gree, subsequently affecting generalization performance. These
observations can be explicitly represented as:
𝜏↓=⇒ΔLCD↑,ΔMID↑=⇒Acc↓ (4)
Based on these observations, we propose the Neural-collapse-
anchored Prompt Tuning (NPT) method, which optimizes the prompt
by introducing two regularizers to implicitly address the drop in
these values even under class imbalance. As illustrated in Fig. 1
(d) and Fig. 2 (b), our NPT enables multi-modality structures to ap-
proach the simplex ETF, thereby improving CLIP’s generalization
performance.
4.2 Neural-collapse-anchored Prompt Tuning
In this subsection, we propose two neural-collapse-anchored regu-
larization terms: Language-modality Collapse (LC) Regularizer and
Multi-modality Isomorphism Degree (MI) Regularizer, which are
guided by ΔLCDandΔMIDrespectively.
Language-modality Collapse Regularization is introduced to
address the issue in language-modality where certain text repre-
sentations are situated exceptionally close while others remain
distantly apart. Achieving an equitable and maximal separation
among text representations is the key to the generalizability of
CLIP. Hence, the LC regularizer encourages the similarity between
any two text representations from different classes to approach 𝜇
(specified in Definition 1):
LLC=𝐾∑︁
𝑖=1𝐾∑︁
𝑗=1,𝑖≠𝑗 ⟨𝐺𝑙(t𝑖),𝐺𝑙(t𝑗⟩−𝐸𝑊·𝜇)2. (5)
where∥𝐺𝑙(t𝑖)∥2≤𝐸𝑊,𝑖=1,...,𝐾 .𝐸𝑊is the class-wise con-
straints for text representation 𝐺𝑙(t𝑖).
Multi-modality Isomorphism Regularization aims to tackle the
issue of multi-modality isomorphism degree (MID) by optimizingthe alignment between language and visual modalities as follows:
LMI=𝐾∑︁
𝑘=1𝑛𝑘∑︁
𝑖=1
⟨𝐺𝑣(f𝑘,𝑖),𝐺𝑙(t𝑘)⟩−√︁
𝐸𝑊·𝐸𝐻2
, (6)
where∥𝐺𝑣(f𝑘,𝑖)∥2≤𝐸𝐻,𝑘=1,...,𝐾 .𝐸𝐻is the instance-wise con-
straints for image representation 𝐺𝑣(f𝑘,𝑖). By minimizing the MI
loss term, our goal is to foster strong alignment between language
and visual representations, which in turn improves model perfor-
mance when handling diverse and imbalanced data distributions.
Overall Framework. By incorporating our proposed regulariza-
tion terms into the contrastive loss function within the current
prompt learning techniques, we can optimize the prompts effec-
tively using the overall loss:
L=LCLIP+𝑤1LLC+𝑤2LMI (7)
whereLCLIP=−1
𝑁Í
𝒙∈XÍ𝐾
𝑘=1𝑦x,𝑘𝑝soft(𝑦=𝑘|x),𝑤1and𝑤2are
hyperparameters governing the contribution of each component.
As illustrated in Fig. 3, the proposed approach harnesses the
strengths of both regularizers: LC Regularizer for minimizing ΔLCD
value and developing more discriminative text representations, and
MI Regularizer for facilitating better multi-modality alignment to
achieve a lower ΔMID.

Remark 2. The gradient equation is composed of two terms. The
"intra-class cohesion" term comprises 𝑛𝑘elements, directs 𝐺𝑙(t𝑘)to-
wards its corresponding image representations z𝑘,𝑖. In contrast, the
"inter-class repulsion" term, with 𝑁−𝑛𝑘elements, pushes 𝐺𝑙(t𝑘)
against features of other classes. Consequently, gradients of certain
minor classes are overwhelmingly influenced by the repulsion term
due to the small 𝑛𝑘and large𝑁−𝑛𝑘.
To tackle this issue, we introduce LLC. The corresponding gra-
dient equation w.r.t. t𝑖is defined as:
𝜕LLC
𝜕t𝑖=𝐾∑︁
𝑗=1,𝑖≠𝑗2 𝑆𝑖𝑗−𝐸𝑊·𝜇𝜕𝐺𝑙(t𝑖)
𝜕t𝑖,𝐺𝑙 t𝑗
,
where𝑆𝑖𝑗=
𝐺𝑙(t𝑖),𝐺𝑙(t𝑗)
.LLCcan explicitly adjust the prompt
t𝑖to ensure text representations are maximally angularly separated,
i.e.,𝑆𝑖𝑗−𝐸𝑊·𝜇. This regularizer effectively mitigates the adverse
effects of imbalanced gradient updates in LCLIP.Gradient w.r.t. image prompt. The gradient ofLCLIP with respect
to the image representation z𝑖is:
𝜕LCLIP
𝜕𝐺𝑣(f𝑖)=(𝑝𝑘(z𝑘,𝑖)−1)𝐺𝑙(t𝑘)+𝐾∑︁
𝑘′≠𝑘𝑝𝑘′(z𝑘,𝑖)𝐺𝑙(t𝑘′).
where z𝑘,𝑖=𝐺𝑣(f𝑘,𝑖),𝑘is the class label of z𝑘,𝑖.
Remark 3. This gradient formula is similar to𝜕LCLIP
𝜕𝐺𝑙(t𝑘). It aims
to bring image representations closer to text representations of the
same class and farther away from those of other classes. However,
text representations can be influenced by imbalance, causing the
representations of minor classes to be close together. Optimizing image
representations towards biased text representations can compromise
performance.
Similarly, we analyze the gradient of LMIw.r.t. f𝑘,𝑖:
𝜕LMI
𝜕f𝑘,𝑖=2

5 EXPERIMENT
Our approach is evaluated on (1) base-to-novel class identifica-
tion, (2) cross-dataset transfer, and (3) domain generalization, un-
der three class imbalance degrees. All trained data are created
by downsampling each class’s samples to obey an exponential
decay with three imbalance ratios 𝜏={1,0.05,0.01}. Here𝜏=
min{𝑛𝑘}/max{𝑛𝑘}with𝑛𝑘being the number of samples in the
𝑘-th class and max{𝑛𝑘}=16.
Datasets. For the first two settings, i.e., base-to-novel generaliza-
tion and cross-dataset transfer, we use the 11 image recognition
datasets as in [45,46]. For domain generalization experiments, we
use ImageNet as the source dataset and four other variants of Im-
ageNet that contain different types of domain shifts as the target
dataset, following [45].
Implementation Details. Since our method is orthogonal to the
other prompt tuning methods, we combine NPT with the existing
CoCoOp and MaPLe, to demonstrate its flexibility and effectiveness.
We apply prompt tuning on ViT-B/16 CLIP where 𝑑=512. All
models are trained for 5 epochs with a batch size of 4 and a learning
rate of 0.0035 via SGD optimizer. Both 𝐸𝑊and𝐸𝐻are set at 1, while
𝑤1and𝑤2are assigned as 0.3and0.8, respectively. We follow other
default hyperparameters used in MaPLe [26].
5.1 Base-to-Novel Generalization
Following [10,45], for each dataset, we split the classes equally into
two groups: the base classes and the novel classes. The learnable
modules are trained exclusively on the imbalanced base classes,
while evaluation is carried out separately on both the base and
novel classes to testify to generalization ability. Table 1 presents the
harmonic mean values for 11 datasets on the base-to-novel tasks.
In the first subtable, we showcase the improvement of NPT on bal-
anced datasets under the base-to-novel task. Our NPT can improve
generalization for most of the datasets (9/11), and the maximal
performance gain is up to 1.3%. When trained on imbalanced base
classes, both CoCoOp and MaPLe see performance dips of 4.13%
and 7.15% respectively at 𝜏=0.05, and 7.13% and 8.89% at 𝜏=0.01,
underscoring the catastrophic impact of class imbalance on general-
ization. Our method exhibits improvements of 1.97% when 𝜏=0.05,
and improvements of 2.47% when 𝜏=0.01over MaPLe.We further compare the accuracy gains of MaPLE on both novel
and base classes before and after integrating NPT in Fig. 4. Our
method significantly outperforms MaPLe in both base and novel
classes across all 11 datasets. Interestingly, we observe that NPT
offers a more substantial improvement in recognizing novel classes,
highlighting its potential in challenging generalization scenarios.
5.2 Cross-Dataset Transfer
We evaluate the generalization ability of our method on more chal-
lenging cross-dataset tasks. In this setting, we learn prompts on
ImageNet of 1000 classes with three imbalance ratios. The effective-
ness of the learned prompts is then tested on the other 10 datasets.
The results are reported in Table 2. The same performance drop
phenomenon can be observed in cross-dataset tasks due to data im-
balance, and combining NPT with CoCoOp and MaPLe can improve
this drop. MaPLe+NPT achieves the best results at all imbalance
ratios, demonstrating the great transfer ability of our method.
5.3 Domain Generalization
We perform experiments with ImageNet as the source domain and
evaluate its ability to generalize to four distinct ImageNet variants,
which serve as unseen target domains. Table 4 presents the results,
indicating that our method significantly improves the performance
on the four ImageNet variants with three imbalance ratios. This
confirms that our approach enhances the discriminability of the
source dataset while preserving its generalization to the target
domain.
5.4 Ablation Study
Effectiveness of each module. We conduct ablation experiments
on three tasks with 𝜏=0.05and𝜏=0.01to assess the effectiveness
of theLLCDandLMIDof NPT, as presented in Table 3. The results
demonstrate that each module has a significant positive impact on
the model’s performance. Specifically, for the base-to-novel task,
the combination of LLCDandLMIDmodules leads to remarkable
improvements of 1.88% at 𝜏=0.05and 2.47% at 𝜏=0.01. These
findings suggest that both modules play a crucial role in enhancing
the model’s generalization ability.
Sensitivity Analysis of 𝑤1and𝑤2.In Fig. 3, we analyze the
impact of the hyperparameters 𝑤1and𝑤2of Eq. 7. The results show
that our method’s performance remains relatively stable across a
broad range of 𝑤1and𝑤2values, indicating the robustness of our
approach to these hyperparameters. This suggests that our method
can be effectively applied to a variety of downstream tasks with
different parameter settings.
5.5 Neural Collapse Visualization
As shown in Figure 6, we visualize the distribution of text represen-
tations and image representations for novel classes on base-to-novel
task in the EuroSAT dataset, considering both balanced and imbal-
anced conditions. The evaluated methods include zero-shot CLIP
(ZSCLIP), current soft prompt tuning methods, and our proposed
approach. Under the balanced condition, ZSCLIP demonstrates a
relatively poor degree of neural collapse. Interestingly, CoOp also
exhibits a significant degree of neural collapse attributed to overfit-
ting on base classes, resulting in limited generalization performance

Figure 6: Comparison of NPT with standard prompt learning methods. (a) Existing methods suffer from lower generalization

on novel classes. However, both CoCoOp and MaPLe improve this
generalization aspect by displaying an evident neural collapse. Our
proposed method showcases a similar level of neural collapse as
observed in MaPLe. Nonetheless, when confronted with imbalanced
scenarios, both CoCoOp and MaPLe suffer from a substantial de-
cline in performance due to neural collapse. By integrating our NPT
method into the framework, we mitigate this degradation to some
extent, leading to enhanced overall performance.CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we explore the text-to-image representation geometry
of CLIP prompt tuning from the perspective of neural collapse. It is
found that class imbalance has detrimental effects on representation,
thus hurting generalization. We propose Neural-collapse-anchored
Prompt Tuning (NPT), a method that optimizes prompts to en-
sure text and image representations share the same simplex ETF
structure. By incorporating language-modality collapse and multi-
modality isomorphism regularization terms, NPT enhances V-L
