ABSTRACT
Population aging, increasing social demands, and rising costs of
treatments are stressing healthcare systems to the point of risking
the sustainability of universal and accessible healthcare.
A hope in this dismal panorama is that there are large inefficien-
cies, and so opportunities for getting more from the same resources.
To name a few, avoidable hospitalizations, unnecessary medication
and tests, and lack of coordination among healthcare agents are
estimated to cost several hundred billion euros per year in the EU.
Technology can be useful for locating and reducing these inefficien-
cies, and within technology, the full exploitation of the data that
the system collects to record its activity.
In this talk, I will review the case for activity data analytics in
healthcare, with two main considerations: 1) The need to include
information about resources and costs in the models, in addition to
clinical knowledge and patient outcomes, and 2) the need to use
mostly data that healthcare organizations already collect and is
not locked and distributed in silos. Fortunately, data collected for
administrative and billing purposes, even though imperfect, partial,
and low resolution, can be used to improve efficiency and safety, as
well as fairness and equity.
I will focus on the work carried out at Amalfi Analytics, a spin-
off of my research group at UPC in Barcelona. On the one hand, we
have addressed predictive management in hospitals, from influx to
the emergency room to availability of surgical areas, beds, and staff.
Anticipating activity, needs, and resource availability lets managers
improve critical KPIs, e.g. waiting times, but also reduce staff stress,
which leads to fewer medical errors and accidents. On the other
hand, we have developed a patient cohort analyzer, based mostly
on a recent clustering algorithm, that gives experts a fresh view of
their patient population and lets them refine protocols and identify
high-risk patient groups. This tool has also been used to support
territorial planning and resource allocation.
These problems have been extensively addressed in the past,
but actual penetration of solutions in hospitals is smaller than one
could expect. For example, one can find hundreds of papers on
predicting influx to emergency rooms or bed demands, but many
of them conclude after producing an AUC figure, and even fewer
describe a working system that can be exported from the hospital

describe the approach taken at Amalfi so that hospitals can have
such a solution up and running in a few days of work for their
IT departments, in what I think is an interesting combination of
software engineering and automatic Machine Learning.

BIOGRAPHY
Ricard Gavaldà is a full professor, currently on leave, at the De-
partment of Computer Science of the Universitat Politècnica de
Catalunya – BarcelonaTech (UPC). His research for over 20 years
has focused on Machine Learning, both in theoretical and algorith-
mic aspects and in applications to real scenarios. On the algorithmic
side he has worked on stream-mining techniques and on frequent
pattern discovery. On the more applied side, from UPC he has led
or participated in knowledge-transfer projects in domains such
as social media analysis, smart cities, fraud detection, customer
churning, and energy efficiency.
Since the mid-2010s, his main interest has been in the application
of Machine Learning and complex pattern analysis to data from
healthcare systems, in order to make them more efficient, fair, and
safe. In 2017 he co-founded the startup Amalfi Analytics, whose aim
is to transform the practice of clinical management by exploiting
existing data, and where works full-time since March 2020.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

lytics: Co-founders (J. Ribera and M. Zamora), students, colleagues,
employees, and advisors. My gratitude extends to the funding agen-
cies listed in Amalfi’s website, to the UPC for their support, and to
investors, especially the Relyens group.
