Abstract
Computation has fundamentally changed the way we study nature.
New data collection technologies, such as GPS, high-definition
cameras, autonomous vehicles under water, on the ground, and
in the air, genotyping, acoustic sensors, and crowdsourcing, are
generating data about life on the planet that are orders of magnitude
richer than any previously collected. Yet, our ability to extract
insight from this data lags substantially behind our ability to collect
it.
The need for understanding is more urgent than ever and the
challenges are great. We are in the middle of the 6th extinction,
losing the planet’s biodiversity at an unprecedented rate and scale.
In many cases, we do not even have the basic numbers of what
species we are losing, which impacts our ability to understand
biodiversity loss drivers, predict the impact on ecosystems, and
implement policy. From the basic science perspective, the new
data opens the possibility of understanding function of traits of
organisms and ecosystems, which is critical for biologists to predict
effects of environmental change or genetic manipulation and to
understand the significance of patterns in the four-billion-year
evolutionary history of life.
The key to unlocking the potential of this data are machine learn-
ing (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods, which are already
beginning to have significant impacts on research across ecology
and conservation. AI can turn data into high resolution information
source about living organisms, enabling scientific inquiry, conser-
vation, and policy decisions.
The talk introduces a new field of science, imageomics, and
presents a vision and examples of AI as a trustworthy partner both
in science and biodiversity conservation, discussing opportunities
and challenges.

Biography
Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf is a Pro-
fessor of Computer Science En-
gineering, Electrical and Com-
puter Engineering, and Evolu-
tion, Ecology, and Organismal
Biology at the Ohio State Uni-
versity, where she is also the
Director of the Translational
Data Analytics Institute. She
is leading the US National Sci-
ence Foundation funded Im-
ageomics Institute and the
newly funded AI and Biodiver-
sity Change (ABC) Global Cli-
mate Center.
Berger-Wolf is a member of the US National Academies Board on
Life Sciences, US National Committee for the International Union
of Biological Sciences (IUBS), and the Advisory Committee for the
Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) AI and Biodiversity working group,
among many others. She has received numerous awards for her
research and mentoring, including University of Illinois Scholar,
UIC Distinguished Researcher of the Year, US National Science
Foundation CAREER, Association for Women in Science Chicago
Innovator, and the UIC Mentor of the Year.
Berger-Wolf is also a director and co-founder of the AI for conser-
vation non-profit Wild Me (now part of Conservation X Labs), home
of the Wildbook project, which has been chosen by UNSECO as one
of the 100 AI projects worldwide supporting the UN Sustainable
Development Goals.
Prior to coming to OSU in January 2020, Berger-Wolf was at
the University of Illinois at Chicago. She received her PhD from
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2002.
