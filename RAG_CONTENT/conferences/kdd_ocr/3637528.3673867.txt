SUMMARY
AI technologies have the immense potential to revolutionize our
daily lives and environments. However, to fully capture and sustain
the benefits of AI, it is crucial to effectively manage the associ-
ated risks. Responsible AI is currently a must [ 2] and spans from
principles [ 3] to regulation, including governance [ 1]. It is key
to addressing the ethical and social challenges of developing and
deploying AI systems. These factors introduce multidimensional
solutions, and require both theoretical and empirical knowledge.
The Responsible AI Day will bring together researchers and
industry professionals to present their views on the problem, focus-
ing on particular aspects or specific use cases. By empowering AI
decision-makers to consider ethical aspects, we can enable innova-
tive ways to advance our mission. Evaluating AI systems correctly
for both, intended and unintended performance, is crucial for build-
ing accountable and responsible systems.
Join us to explore the potential and challenges of Responsible
AI and listen to speakers that will bring a localized view of it such
as Andrea Aler, Cristian Canton, Carlos Castillo, Vanina Martínez,
Nuria Oliver, and Andreas Theodorou, ending with a community
discussion. Together, we can shape the future of AI and ensure its
ethical deployment!
