Abstract  
The European Data Science Day offers a full day focused 
exclusively on innovative KDD -relevant research and 
development projects from national and regional funding 
programs, as well as corporate, start -up, and nonprofit channels. 
The idea is to bring together a diverse community of researchers 
in Data Science, Machine Learning, Language Technologies, and 
Knowledge Discovery, as well as partnerships in the social and 
physical sciences/arts, to showcase the state -of-the-art in 
research and applications .

 1 Focus of the European Data Science Day  
This European Data Science Special Day  of the International 
Conference ACM KDD 2024  [1] solicited submissions primarily 
from collaborative projects, whether publicly or privately 
funded. Preference was given to open science and innovation 
projects, especially those contributing to open source, open data, 
or socially impactful goals. However, we welcomed submissions 
from particularly interesting projects that do not exactly fit these  
criteria if they provide new insights and compelling 
demonstrations.    
The authors were asked to include the following information  
in their submission : 
• A brief description of the research goals and partners . 
• The main contribution/innovation that they would like to 
showcase.  
• How the project fits within the KDD ecosystem.  
• If available, links to online demonstrations or a description 
of what they plan to show interactively to the audience.  
• If available, links to the project website, repositories, and 
other dissemination materials (optional).  
Submissions were evaluated based on the level of innovation 
and research breakthroughs, fit with KDD, the compelling nature 
of the demonstrations/additional information, and the need to 
create an event with a broad array of themes.  
2 Program of the European Data Science Day  
The program includes keynote presentations, project 
presentations with demos, and posters. Projects are allotted a 10 -
minute pitch/presentation and demonstration time, as well as a 
poster slot in a dedicated poster session. All projects must 
provide instructive and compelling demonstrations of their 
results, not marketing.  
2.1  Keynotes  
1. OECD AI Observatory and AI Incidents Monitor , by 
Karine Perset, OECD  
As AI -related policymaking gains traction, it requires evidence, 
foresight, and international cooperation. Used by policy makers 
and AI practitioners in over 220 countries, the OECD.AI Policy 
Observatory leads the way in shaping AI policy for trustworthy 
AI. It provides live data and knowledge that shed light on the †Author Footnote to be captured as Author Note /use for identifying contact author

 most recent developments in AI, and serves as a global hub for 
international collaboration and sharing of good practices. 
OECD.AI resources serve as common references for the 
international AI community. For example, its catalogue of 
practical tools and metrics helps practitioners develop and use 
trustworthy AI; its AI Incidents Monitor provides valuable 
insights into the risks and harms of AI systems; and its database 
of over 1,000 AI policies from 70 countries facilitates cross -
country comparisons and learning. As AI advances rapidly, 
OECD.AI's role will become even more vital, standing as a 
beacon of guidance and a catalyst for global collaboration for 
trustworthy AI.  
2. NSF Strategy on AI , by Cornelia Caragea , NSF and 
University of Illinois Chicago  
NSF Directorate for Computer and Information Science and 
Engineering  supports investigator -initiated research and 
education in all areas of computer and information science and 
engineering, fosters broad interdisciplinary collaboration, helps 
develop and maintain cutting -edge national cyberinfrastructure 
for research and education, and contributes to the development 
of a computer and information technology workforce with skills 
necessary for success in the increasingly competitive global 
market.
