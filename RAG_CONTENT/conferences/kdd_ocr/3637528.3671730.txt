Abstract
Mobile traffic prediction plays a crucial role in enabling efficient
network management and service provisioning. Traditional predic-
tion approaches treat different mobile application services (such
as Uber, Facebook, Twitter, etc) as isolated entities, neglecting po-
tential correlation among them. Moreover, such isolated prediction
methods necessitate the uploading of historical traffic data from
all regions to forecast city-wide traffic, resulting in consuming
substantial bandwidth resources and risking prediction failure in
the event of data loss in specific regions. To address these chal-
lenges, we propose a novel Cross-service Attention-based Spatial-
Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (CsASTGCN) for precise
and communication-efficient multi-service mobile traffic prediction.
Our methodology allows each mobile service to transmit the traffic
data of only a fraction of regions for city-wide traffic prediction of
all mobile services, which reduces the resource consumption caused
by data transmission. Specifically, the sparse traffic data are initially
transmitted to the cloud server and the masked graph autoencoder
is utilized to roughly reconstruct the traffic volume for regions with
missing data. Subsequently, a cross-service attention-based predic-
tor is designed to calculate the data correlation among different
mobile services within the same region. Considering the constantly
emerging mobile services, we incorporate a novel model-based
adaptive transfer learning scheme to extract valuable knowledge
from the existing models and expedite the training of a new model
for a new service without training from scratch, thereby enhancing
the scalability of our framework. Extensive experiments conducted
on a large-scale real-world mobile traffic dataset demonstrate that
our model greatly outperforms the existing schemes, enhancing
both the communication-efficiency and robustness of large-scale
multi-service traffic prediction.

1 Introduction
With the enhancement of mobile device hardware performance and
the evolution of new-generation communication technology, mo-
bile services installed on these devices have become more diverse
and intricately integrated into the daily lives of ordinary people.
Accurately predicting the traffic volume of mobile services is par-
ticularly crucial for both efficient business management and city
management. Firstly, precise mobile traffic prediction aids service
providers in gaining a better understanding of user demands and
behavioral habits. Analyzing data such as the number of users,
frequency of use, and usage time of mobile services allows ser-
vice providers to glean insights into users’ lifestyles, consumption
habits, and hobbies in different regions. This information, in turn,
enables providers to allocate resources more effectively and en-
hance the quality of service (QoS) [ 12]. Secondly, mobile service
traffic prediction assists city management departments in obtain-
ing a clearer picture of the city’s operational status and providing
a scientific basis by estimating socio-economic indicators, urban
traffic conditions, public safety and so on.
The traffic patterns of mobile services display periodic, inter-
mittent, regional, and dynamic characteristics over time. Some re-
searchers capture the above characteristics and propose prediction
methods for a single mobile service [ 8,12,29,39]. Different from
the above research, some researchers consider the multi-service
prediction scenarios by utilizing the complex relationship of the
traffic patterns of different services [ 22,32,37]. Regardless of single-
service or multi-service scenario, these methods rely on the funda-
mental assumption that all historical data are complete and readily
available. Based on the above assumption, the previous methods
 
794
KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Zhiying Feng, Qiong Wu, and Xu Chen
allow each mobile service to make predictions using its own histor-
ical data during model inference stage, which ignores the benefits
of inherent correlation among various mobile services for model
inference. However, the assumption of data integrity would not
be fully satisfied in reality, due to occasional data loss during the
data transmission. For a specific mobile service, when the assump-
tion of data integrity cannot be guaranteed, the previous methods
fail to obtain additional information from other mobile services to
compensate for prediction errors caused by missing data, leading
to predictive performance degradation or even prediction failures.
Even if data loss does not occur, collecting and transmitting histor-
ical traffic data of all regions across the entire city to the remote
cloud server in real time requires significantly large amount of ex-
pensive communication bandwidth and the transmission overhead
is further magnified due to the long transmission delay of Wide
Area Network (WAN) and potential network congestion [36].
In this work, we aim to address the following fundamental issue:
can we leverage the data correlations among different mobile
services to reduce the amount of data transmission while
achieving accurate multi-service traffic prediction? To this
end, we delve into a solution capable of integrating predictions from
various mobile services within a unified framework and propose
a novel cross-service traffic prediction scheme, which is shown in
Figure 1. We break the basic assumption of data integrity mentioned
above and propose a novel method to handle the situation of incom-
plete data, no matter passive data loss or active data abandonment.
To address this challenge, we consider the cross-service correlation
during both the model training and inference stages to achieve
information exchange and fusion among different mobile services.
Specifically, we devise the Cross-service Attention-based Spatial-
Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (CsASTGCN), which si-
multaneously integrates temporal correlation, spatial correlation,
and cross-service correlation of the traffic data in a unified manner.
Temporal convolution is leveraged to capture time-dependent pat-
terns of the historical traffic trends. Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) is employed to handle spatial correlations, considering the in-
terconnected relationships among different regions within the same
mobile service. To incorporate cross-service correlations, attention
mechanism allows the model to adaptively weigh the influence
of various mobile services on the prediction. This comprehensive
approach addresses the challenges posed by missing historical data
in specific regions, achieving precise and communication-efficient
traffic prediction. Within this framework, diverse mobile services
can efficiently transmit and complement information, leading to
benefits such as reduced data transmission volume and enhanced
training efficiency without sacrificing prediction accuracy.
Furthermore, in order to improve the scalability and training
efficiency of the proposed framework, we further propose a novel
model-based adaptive personalized transfer learning scheme to
extract valuable knowledge from the models of existing mobile
services and expedite the training of the model of a newly-operated
mobile service without training from scratch. The model for the new
mobile service seamlessly integrates into the original CsASTGCN
framework without requiring alterations to the model structure or
parameters of existing mobile services.

In this section, we first give the data description and detailed anal-
ysis of mobile traffic datasets of different mobile services, and then
elaborate the problem formulation of multi-service traffic predic-
tion.

2.1 Multi-service Traffic Dataset Description
The multi-service traffic dataset we study in this paper is provided
by the renowned network operator Orange [ 18], which encom-
passes records of spatio-temporal consumption for 68 popular mo-
bile services across 20 cities in France. The geographical area of
each city in France is partitioned into several regions in the form
of a grid structure, each measuring 100m ×100m. The sampling
frequency is set as 15 minutes per sampling point. The dataset spans
77 consecutive days from March 16, 2019, to May 31, 2019.
Diversity and similarity coexist in mobile service traffic pattern
among different regions. For example, in Figure 2, we plot the
Twitter download traffic of four regions in Paris from 00:00 to 24:00
on April 1, 2019, where Tile 103950 and Tile 103951 are adjacent
regions, and so are Tile 81451 and Tile 81105. The traffic volume
and trends of adjacent regions exhibit similarity. The trend of traffic
changes in regions that are far apart can also be similar, but there
may be notable differences in traffic volume. It can be seen that for
the same mobile service, its traffic changes have similar periodicity,
but due to differences in population density in different regions and
other reasons, the traffic volume often have large differences.

Figure 2: The download traffic of Twitter of different regions
on April 1, 2019.
As depicted in Figure 3(a), the traffic series of four mobile ser-
vices, including Twitter, Uber, Facebook Like, and Spotify, display
similar periodicity. To quantify this correlation among different
service traffic, we introduce the widely used correlation coefficient
defined as shown in Eq. (1). The values of correlation coefficient in
Figure 3(b) indicate a significant difference in correlation among
various mobile services, ranging from a maximum of 0.8 to a mini-
mum of only 0.22. It can be clearly told that the correlation indeed
exists among different mobile services. The degree of cross-service
correlation depends, to a certain extent, on the similarity of types
of mobile services, For example, both Facebook Live and Twitter
belong to social media services, so they have a high correlation.
On the contrary, Uber and Spotify are respectively car-hailing apps
and streaming music service platforms, so they have a low correla-
tion. This differentiated correlation can be utilized for mobile traffic
prediction.

2.2 Problem Formulation
The geographical area of a city can be divided into 𝑀regions,
and these regions are denoted as M={1,2,...,𝑀}. The set of
mobile services are denoted as S={1,2,...,𝑆}. For each region
𝑣∈M , the traffic volume of mobile service 𝑠∈S at time slot 𝑡
can be represented as 𝑦𝑡𝑣,𝑠. We aim to predict the traffic demand of
mobile service 𝑠in region𝑣at time slot𝑡+1given 1) the previous
𝑃observed traffic data of service 𝑠in region𝑣,y𝑡−𝑃+1:𝑡𝑣,𝑠 ; 2) the
previous𝑃observed traffic data of other relative services in region
𝑣,y𝑡−𝑃+1:𝑡
𝑣,𝑟∈S\𝑠; 3) the previous 𝑃observed traffic data of service 𝑠in
other regions, y𝑡−𝑃+1:𝑡
𝑢∈M\ 𝑣,𝑠; and 4) the previous 𝑃observed traffic
data of other relative services in other regions, y𝑡−𝑃+1:𝑡
𝑢∈M\ 𝑣,𝑟∈S\𝑠. The
mobile service traffic prediction problem can be formulated as
𝑦𝑡+1
𝑣,𝑠=F(y𝑡−𝑃+1:𝑡
𝑣,𝑠,y𝑡−𝑃+1:𝑡
𝑣,𝑟∈S\𝑠,y𝑡−𝑃+1:𝑡
𝑢∈M\ 𝑣,𝑠,y𝑡−𝑃+1:𝑡
𝑢∈M\ 𝑣,𝑟∈S\𝑠).(2)
However, in real-world scenarios, collecting traffic data for all
mobile services in each region and transmitting it to the remote
server is costly, and ensuring data integrity is often a challenge.
Based on the above considerations, we aim to achieve accurate and
robust prediction of mobile service traffic data when input data is
sparse. Therefore, the problem of Eq. (2) can be further expressed
as
𝑦𝑡+1
𝑣,𝑠=F(ey𝑡−𝑃+1:𝑡

3 CsASTGCN Framework For Cross-service
Traffic Prediction
In this section, we introduce the proposed cross-service traffic pre-
diction scheme, CsASTGCN. Initially, we discuss the construction
of the spatial relation graph. Subsequently, we provide an overview
of the CsASTGCN framework. Then, we present the detailed design
 
796KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Zhiying Feng, Qiong Wu, and Xu Chen
of the masked graph feature reconstruction module and the cross-
service attention based predictor. Finally, we provide the detail of
the adaptive masking strategy.
3.1 Construction of Spatial Relation Graph
The grid structure of the city divides the city into several regions
from a geographical perspective. For a given region, the grid struc-
ture can only obtain information from surrounding regions, and
cannot obtain information from regions that are far apart but have
similar traffic patterns. Therefore, the city’s grid structure must
undergo transformation into a graph structure based on specific
criteria to achieve more effective information transmission among
different regions. In this research, we consider two criteria: 1) the
distance of geographical location; 2) the similarity of historical traf-
fic series, to transform the grid structure into graph structure. For
𝑣∈M , the𝐾geoclosest regions to 𝑣will be established edge with 𝑣.
Besides, by calculating the cosine similarity [ 30] of historical traffic
series data of different regions, the 𝐾simregions with the highest
similarity to 𝑣are obtained, and then they are established edge with
𝑣. Therefore, each region will be connected to at most 𝐾geo+𝐾sim
other regions. This relation graph can reflect the spatial relationship
among regions considering both the geographical distance and the
data similarity. Based on the above graph construction method, we
construct the spatial relation graph of each mobile service. For each
mobile service 𝑠, we derive the adjacency matrix A𝑠and the degree
matrix eD𝑠.
3.2 Overview of CsASTGCN Framework
Given the spatial relation graphs of all mobile services, we propose
CsASTGCN framework for precise multi-service traffic prediction,
which consists of two key module, the masked feature reconstruc-
tion module and the cross-service attention based predictor. The
graph data with some nodes (e.g., regions) masked are first fed into
the masked feature reconstruction module. Then the features of
masked nodes are reconstructed, forming a reconstructed graph.
Following masked feature reconstruction, the reconstructed graph
is fed into the cross-service attention based predictor, which consist
of the spatial-temporal feature extractor and attention-based coor-
dinator. Each mobile service utilizes the spatial-temporal feature
extractor to obtain their node embedding synchronously. In order
to improve the prediction performance by leveraging cross-service
correlations, each mobile service exchanges its own node embed-
ding with other mobile services, and achieves cross-service fusion
and collaboration under the attention-based coordinator. Finally,
the final prediction results are obtained through a fully connected
layer. The diagram of the CsASTGCN framework is illustrated in
Figure 4.
3.3 Masked Feature Reconstruction
In this context, we consider historical traffic data as the nodes’
features to form the feature matrix H(0)
𝑠. Considering the issues of
data loss and high transmission overhead, we opt for transmitting
a sparse graph instead of a complete graph for further processing.
Nevertheless, directly inputting this sparse graph into the predictor
can lead to substantial errors. Hence, it is crucial to reconstruct the
masked features initially. Inspired by the approach presented in [ 13],we first mask the features of randomly selected nodes in the feature
matrix H(0)
𝑠and then incorporate a masked graph autoencoder to
address the reconstruction of masked features. This autoencoder
comprises an encoder and a decoder. The process of generating
reconstructed features can be represented as follows:
H𝑠,mask=𝑓encoder(H(0)
𝑠,mask,eA𝑠), (4)
Z𝑠,mask=𝑓decoder(H𝑠,mask,eA𝑠), (5)
where H(0)
𝑠,mask=H(0)
𝑠⊙Mask 𝑠is original masked features, eA𝑠=
A𝑠+I𝑀, and I𝑀is the𝑀-dimensional identity matrix.
The object of masked feature reconstruction is to minimize the
mean squared error (MSE) between the original features H(0)
𝑠and
the reconstructed features Z𝑠,mask. The backbones of the encoder
and the decoder can be any type of GNNs, such as GCN[ 2], GAT[ 28],
or GIN[ 31]. In this research, we use GCN as the backbones of both
the encoder and the decoder. The total layers of encoder and decoder
are𝐿MFR, Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) can be transffered into Eq. (6) and Eq.
(7).

layer of mobile service 𝑠’s masked graph autoencoder.
3.4 Cross-service Attention based Predictor
In this section, we propose a novel predictor that can jointly inte-
grates temporal correlation, spatial correlation, and cross-service
correlation in a holistic manner and introduce the spatial-temporal
feature extractor and attention-based coordinator separately below.
By regarding time series data as a one-channel and one-dimensional
image, we first use the temporal convolutional layers to extract the
temporal features of nodes. Inspired by [ 34], we combine three tem-
poral convolutional layers as a whole to form a temporal-convolutional
block. Specifically, for the service 𝑠in region𝑣, given the input x𝑣,𝑠,
the output of temporal convolutional block can be formulated as:
𝑜TC1
𝑣,𝑠=𝑓TC1 x𝑣,𝑠;𝜃TC1, (8)

where𝜃TC1,𝜃TC2and𝜃TC3are the trainable parameters of these
three temporal convolutional layers, 𝜎reluand𝜎sigmoid are the relu
and sigmoid activation function.
After the above processing, all nodes form a new graph O(TC)
𝑠,
containing the temporal features. We use a graph convolutional
layer to extract the spatial features of nodes. For service 𝑠, given the

where E𝑠is the output of the graph convolutional layer, W𝑠is the
trainable parameters of the graph convolutional layer. The feature
of service𝑠in region𝑣ofE𝑠can be expressed as e𝑣,𝑠. We combine
a graph convolution layer with a temporal convolutional block to
create a spatio-temporal block. We stack several spatio-temporal
blocks as a spatial-temporal feature extractor to extract the node
embedding.
The masked feature reconstruction module outlined above effec-
tively addresses the majority of missing data by relying on infor-
mation from the adjacent nodes and the nodes with similar traffic
pattern within the same service, which are often not completely
consistent with the real data. To enhance prediction accuracy, we
further propose cross-service attention based predictor to utilize
the correlation among different mobile services, because the traffic
data of distinct mobile services in the same region is correlated,
as illustrated in in Figure 3. Therefore, we introduce the attention
mechanism [27] to automatically learn this correlation and utilize
it to enhance prediction accuracy. As far as we know, we are the
first to exploit cross-service correlations to handle multi-service
mobile traffic prediction. It is worth noting that the methodology
introduced in our paper is distinct from the approach described in
[11], where attention mechanism is used to capture the dynamic
spatial-temporal correlations in traffic data. Specifically, for mobile
service𝑠in region𝑣, the query vector, the key vector, and the value
vector are calculated as follows:
q𝑣,𝑠=W(𝑠)
query e𝑣,𝑠, (13)
k𝑣,𝑠=W(𝑠)
keye𝑣,𝑠. (14)
v𝑣,𝑠=W(𝑠)
valuee𝑣,𝑠, (15)
where W(𝑠)
query ,W(𝑠)
key, and W(𝑠)
value∈R𝑑×𝑃are trainable matrix, e𝑣,𝑠
is the node embedding of service 𝑠in region𝑣after the extraction
of spatial-temporal feature extractor.For the mobile service 𝑟, we multiplies its own W(𝑟)
keyand the
node embedding e𝑣,𝑟to obtain the key vector k𝑣,𝑟=W(𝑟)
keye𝑣,𝑟. The
attention coefficient of service 𝑟towards service 𝑠is calculated as
the inner product of q𝑣,𝑠andk𝑣,𝑟:
𝛼𝑡
𝑣,𝑠,𝑟=qT𝑣,𝑠k𝑣,𝑟√
𝑑. (16)
In addition to considering the correlation of data between the
target service and other collaborative services, we take into account
the proportion of real nodes and reconstructed nodes of the mobile
services. For a specific node 𝑣of mobile service 𝑠, the higher the
proportion of real data of itself and its adjacent nodes, the greater
weight we should assign to this service. Therefore, we define 𝛽𝑡𝑣,𝑟
as the proportion of real data in region 𝑣with its adjacent regions
of mobile service 𝑟. The normalized attention coefficient of service
𝑟towards service 𝑠is calculated using softmax function as follows:
ˆ𝛼𝑡
𝑣,𝑠,𝑟=exp(𝜎sigmoid(𝛼𝑡𝑣,𝑠,𝑟)𝛽𝑡𝑣,𝑟)
Í
𝑖∈Sexp(𝜎sigmoid(𝛼𝑡
𝑣,𝑠,𝑖)𝛽𝑡
𝑣,𝑖). (17)
The impact of all other mobile services on a specific service 𝑠is
calculated by weighted aggregation as follows:
ˆe𝑣,𝑠=∑︁
𝑟∈Sˆ𝛼𝑡
𝑣,𝑠,𝑟v𝑣,𝑟,(18)
where ˆe𝑣,𝑠is the collaborative embedding of other services towards
service𝑠. For the service 𝑠in region𝑣, the collaborative embedding
ˆe𝑣,𝑠is fed into the MLP to predict the mobile traffic demand 𝑦𝑡+1𝑣,𝑠
as shown in Eq. (19).
𝑦𝑡+1
𝑣,𝑠=MLP(ˆe𝑣,𝑠). (19)
3.5 Adaptive Masking Strategy
In our quest to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the training
process, we employ a dynamic approach to adjust the composition
ofMask 𝑠by leveraging the loss values associated with each trained
node. Specifically, with a given mask rate 𝛾𝑠, we selectively mask
out the𝛾𝑠of nodes displaying the lowest training loss values, which
helps mitigate their influence on subsequent iterations. Conversely,
 
798KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Zhiying Feng, Qiong Wu, and Xu Chen
the remaining 1−𝛾𝑠of nodes with the highest training loss val-
ues are retained, prioritizing their contributions to the model’s
parameter updates.
This strategy is grounded in the idea that nodes with higher
training losses may contain more valuable information for model
performance improvement. It introduces an adaptive element to
the optimization process, to refine the model’s focus on nodes with
potentially richer gradients, which contributes to overall training
efficiency and enhances the model’s ability to capture intricate pat-
terns in the data. Moreover, considering nodes with higher training
losses as more challenging to converge, providing raw data for their
training becomes essential. The proposed methodology embodies

Learning Scheme
When tasked with training a new model for a fresh mobile service,
transfer learning allows us to glean valuable knowledge from sev-
eral existing local models, thereby avoiding the need to start train-
ing from scratch and significantly enhancing training efficiency.
Through transfer learning, we hope to achieve the following three
goals: 1) A higher starting point: before fine-tuning, the initial per-
formance of the transfer model is higher than training from scratch.
2) Faster convergence speed: the model for a new service conver-
gences faster by fine-tuning the transferred model of an existing
service. 3) Better final model: the convergence performance of the
final model after fine-tuning is better than that without transfer
learning. As shown in Figure 3, there are significant differences in
the correlation among different mobile services. The importance
of knowledge transferred for the new models varies among the
existing models. In alignment with these objectives, we design a
novel model-based adaptive personalized transfer learning scheme.
This proposed transfer learning approach calculates the correlation
between different source services and the target service through
exploratory training. It then utilizes gradient descent to adjust the
transfer weights of different source services for different layers.
The detailed training process of the proposed adaptive transfer
learning scheme is elaborated in Figure 5, which contains three
main steps.
Step 1. Transfer model aggregation. The source model of
mobile service 𝑖is denoted as W𝑖. The transfer strategy can be
expressed as Θ𝑡=
Θ𝑡
1,...,Θ𝑡
𝑖,...,Θ𝑡
𝑆
, where Θ𝑡
𝑖is the matrix with
the same size of W𝑖. The transfer model can be calculated as
W𝑡
𝑆+1=𝑆∑︁
𝑖=1Θ𝑡
𝑖⊙W𝑖, (20)
where the elements of Θ𝑡
𝑖are all initialized as1
𝑆,∀𝑖.
Step 2. Loss calculation. Use the local dataset D𝑆+1of mobile
service𝑆+1 to calculate the loss value L𝑡(Θ𝑡;W1,...,W𝑆)of the
current transfer model.
Step 3. Transfer strategy update. The parameters of source
models W𝑡
1,W𝑡
2,...,W𝑡
𝑆are frozen. The transfer strategy is updated
as
ˆΘ𝑡
𝑖=Θ𝑡
𝑖−𝜂∇Θ𝑡
𝑖L𝑡
=Θ𝑡
𝑖−𝜂W𝑖⊙∇W𝑡
𝑆+1L𝑡.(21)
Step 4. Normalization. The transfer strategy is normalized
using softmax function:
Θ𝑡+1
𝑖,𝑙=exp(ˆΘ𝑡
𝑖,𝑙)
Í𝑆
𝑖=1exp(ˆΘ𝑡
𝑖,𝑙),∀𝑖,𝑙, (22)
where ˆΘ𝑡
𝑖,𝑙is the𝑙th layer of ˆΘ𝑡
𝑖.
The above steps are executed repeatedly until the target number
of training rounds is reached. It is worth noting that the total num-
ber of the exploratory training rounds is limited compared with
the following fine-tuning.
The suggested adaptive transfer learning method provides a
flexible means to expand the scale of the CsASTGCN framework.

Figure 5: The workflow of model-based adaptive personalized
transfer learning scheme.
Expanding on the principles of transfer learning for a single mo-
bile service, we introduce a progressive transfer learning scheme
tailored for multiple mobile services. Assume the original CsAST-
GCN framework comprises 𝑆mobile services, with 𝑆newupcoming
mobile services awaiting integration into the CsASTGCN frame-
work. We transfer the knowledge of 𝑆models under the original
CsASTGCN framework to one new mobile service, creating a cor-
responding new model, and subsequently integrating it into the
updated CsASTGCN framework. Following this analogy, we iter-
ate through the transfer of new models one by one until all 𝑆new
services are successfully assimilated into the CsASTGCN frame-
work. The comparison between our proposed progressive transfer
learning method and the traditional transfer learning method is
shown in Figure 6. The advantage of our progressive transfer learn-
ing method is that it can gradually expand the diversity of mobile
services within the CsASTGCN framework, thereby enriching the
potential knowledge learned by subsequent mobile services that re-
quire knowledge transfer and accelerating the subsequent training
process.
5 Experiments
5.1 Experimental Settings
Due to computing resource limitations in our research lab, we opt
to use data from 01/04/2019 to 30/04/2019 (30 days) for training
and testing. In the experiment, the first 80% and the last 20% of
the dataset are designated as the training set and testing set, re-
spectively. For the performance evaluation, we choose 4 mobile
services including Twitter, Uber, Facebook Live, Spotify in two city
including Paris and Bordeaux, for the collaborative learning. Be-
sides, we select Twitter, Uber, Facebook Live, Spotify as the source
domain and Facebook Messenger as the target domain to evaluate
the performance of the proposed adaptive transfer learning method.
Baselines. We compare our proposed method with the following
widely used methods:
•Historical average (HA): HA predicts the value using the
average of previous mobile traffic demand of the given region
in the same relative time interval (i.e., the same time of the
day) [33].

scheme (a) and traditional transfer learning scheme (b),
where each circle represents a mobile service.
•STGCN: STGCN is a time series prediction method that con-
siders the graph structure. This method does not consider
the correlation among different mobile services [34].
•LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of re-
current neural network architecture designed to effectively
capture and retain long-range dependencies in sequential
data, making it well-suited for tasks such as time series pre-
diction and natural language processing [26].
•CNN-LSTM: CNN and LSTM are integrated into a model to
capture spatial dependency and temporal relationship in a
holistic manner [14].
Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate our model with Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which are
defined as follows:
𝑀𝐴𝐸 =1
𝑧𝑧∑︁
𝑖=1|ˆ𝑦𝑖−𝑦𝑖|, (23)
𝑅𝑀𝐴𝐸 =vt
1
𝑧𝑧∑︁
𝑖=1(ˆ𝑦𝑖−𝑦𝑖)2, (24)
where ˆ𝑦𝑖is the predicted value, 𝑦𝑖is the ground truth, and 𝑧is the
total number of predicted samples.
5.2 Prediction Results
Performance Comparison. We standardized the transmission cost of
all baselines at 100%, implying that the baselines can make predic-
tions using the complete data. In our CsASTGCN scheme, we vary
the data integrity rates (e.g., transmission cost) to 60%, 70%, and
80%, respectively. As depicted in Figure 7(a), CsASTGCN consis-
tently outperforms all baselines with significantly lower transmis-
sion costs, achieving the lowest average MAE (3,999) and average
RMAE (6,696) in Paris. Illustrated in Figure 7(b), CsASTGCN also
outperforms all baselines with notably reduced transmission costs,
resulting in the lowest average MAE (288) and average RMAE (378)
 
800KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Zhiying Feng, Qiong Wu, and Xu Chen
in Bordeaux. Although the MAE and RMAE of STGCN are compa-
rable to CsASTGCN in both Paris and Bordeaux, the transmission
cost is considerably higher than that of CsASTGCN.
Furthermore, for visual illustration, we plot the ground truth and
predicted values of a given region in Paris in Figure 8. It shows that
most predicted values generated by CsASTGCN are much closer
to the corresponding ground truth throughout the time period
compared to other baselines.

Robust analysis. To clearly demonstrate the superiority of CsAST-
GCN, we delve into a robust analysis of various prediction methods.
In this section, we assess how the prediction error of different
methods changes as the proportion of uploaded data decreases.
Specifically, we randomly selected 0%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of the
nodes in the testing set, respectively, as the missing/failure nodes,
by setting the historical traffic data of these nodes to 0. Figure 9
and Figure 10 illustrate that the MAE and RMAE of CsASTGCN
remain relatively stable and even slightly decrease as the mask rate
increases, while the performance of other baselines generally dete-
riorates. This verifies that CsASTGCN possesses the nice property
of robustness.
5.3 Effect of Attention Mechanism
To validate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism, we com-
pare the prediction results of our CsASTGCN model with and with-
out the attention mechanism. As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, the
CsASTGCN model exhibited significant improvements in predic-
tion accuracy and performance metrics when attention mechanisms
were incorporated. Specifically, CsASTGCN achieved an average
performance gain of more than 9% and 5% over CsASTGCN without
attention in terms of MAE and RMAE under different mask rates.

5.4 Performance of Transfer Learning
In Figure 11 and Figure 12, we depict the training loss for masked
graph autoencoder and he proposed predictor under various trans-
fer methods, where the global model is obtained by taking a simple
average of the model parameters from the source domain models.
The adaptive model is obtained from our proposed model-based
adaptive personalized transfer learning scheme. It is clear that our
adaptive transfer learning method can let the target model better
learn the useful knowledge from different models in a personalized
way.
To verify the effectiveness of the proposed progressive tranfer
learning method, we select Twitter, Uber, Facebook Live, and Spotify
as the source services, and select Facebook Messenger, Netflix, and
YouTube as the target services. We compare the number of train-
ing rounds required for progressive transfer and non-progressive
transfer to reduce to the same training error. Table 3 and Table 4
show that as the number of mobile services incorporated into the
CsASTGCN framework increases, the number of rounds required
for subsequent model training to reach the target training error
decreases.
The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of trans-
ferring knowledge from our model-based adaptive personalized
transfer learning scheme to enhance the performance of the new
mobile service. This approach not only streamlines the learning
process for the new mobile service but also underscores the sig-
nificance of leveraging pre-existing knowledge to achieve optimal
results. The above results demonstrate the scalability of the method
proposed in this paper. Through adaptive transfer learning, the
scale of mobile services for collaborative training and inference can
be rapidly expanded.

The incorporation of a masked graph autoencoder, cross-service
attention based predictor, and a novel transfer learning scheme
contributes to its effectiveness. Our extensive experiments on a
real-world dataset showcase the model’s robustness and scalability,
making CsASTGCN a valuable advancement in large-scale cross-
service traffic prediction for information-based cities. Future re-
search directions could focus on further optimizing the structure
and algorithms of the CsASTGCN model by integrating the latest
deep learning techniques, such as Transformer, federated learn-
ing, etc., to enhance its computational efficiency and prediction
accuracy.

B.1 Mobile Traffic Prediction
Initially, researchers utilized traditional time series prediction meth-
ods to mobile traffic prediction, such as ARIMA [ 15,35], Holt [ 25],
Prophet [ 17]. However, these conventional time series prediction
methods rely on classic statistical principles, making it challenging
to capture the nonlinear and intricate dependencies within mobile
service traffic data. Recent advances in deep learning models have
become strong competitors to classic statistical models in traffic
prediction [ 38]. Mobile service traffic prediction methods based

on deep learning can be roughly divided into RNN-based methods
[9,26] and CNN-based ones [ 38,39]. In [ 26], Trinh et al. employed
LSTM to predict the mobile traffic of an LTE base station. Feng et
al.introduced an end-to-end model to predict traffic demands from
spatial-dependent and long-period cellular traffic [ 9]. Most RNN
framework are autoregressive generative models, where a predic-
tion is generated by using the past observations, and the generated
result is then fed back as the ground truth to make further predic-
tion [ 3]. Consequently, RNN encounters challenges in large-scale
parallel processing. To improve the efficiency of time series predic-
tion, Lea et al. first proposed Temporal Convolutional Networks,
employing a hierarchy of temporal convolutions to handle time
series [ 16]. Inspired by [ 16], some researchers delve into the CNN-
based mobile service traffic prediction. Zhang et al. introduced a
densely connected CNN to learn spatial dependence and augment
feature propagation [ 38]. Zhao et al. proposed a spatial-temporal at-
tention convolution network to predict the citywide cellular traffic
[39]. Some researchers further leverage GNN to extract correlations
in mobile traffic across different regions [ 8,12,29]. Fang et al. pro-
posed to model the spatial relevancy among cells by a dependency
graph based on spatial distances among cells and applied GCN and
LSTM to model the spatial and temporal aspects, respectively [ 8].
Heet al. introduced Graph Attention Spatial-Temporal Networkfor precise mobile traffic prediction, where they built a spatial re-
lation graph based on the time series similarity of traffic demand
using the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm [ 12]. Wang et al. pro-
posed a TSGAN model, incorporating a time-series similarity-based
spatial information integration and graph attention networks for
cellular traffic prediction [ 29]. Different from the above research
that conducts mobile traffic prediction for a single service, some
researchers consider the multi-service prediction scenarios by uti-
lizing the complex relationship of the traffic patterns of different
services. For example, Zhang et al. combine sequence-to-sequence
(S2S) learning paradigm and convolutional long short-term memo-
ries (ConvLSTMs) to handle multi-service mobile traffic forecasting
[37]. Rago et al. combine multi-service traffic classification and
prediction into a whole task and use autoencoders as key building
blocks for common feature representations, shared by both classifi-
cation and prediction tasks [ 22]. Xu et al. divide different mobile
services into several clusters and employ a single model for each
service cluster, which can learn specific patterns corresponding to
the unique cluster features [32].
B.2 Transfer Learning
Transfer learning stands out as a crucial tool in machine learning for
addressing the fundamental issue of limited training data [ 24]. The
primary concept of transfer learning involves utilizing knowledge
from a pre-trained model on a source domain to aid in learning in
a different, but related, target domain. Transfer learning encom-
passes instance transfer, feature representation transfer, parameter
transfer, and relational knowledge transfer [ 21]. Instance transfer
involves directly assigning varying weights to different instances.
Daiet al. introduced TrAdaBoost, a method that re-weights source
domain instances to amplify the impact of favorable instances and
diminish the influence of unfavorable ones [ 5]. Sun et al. proposed
a two-stage weighting framework for multi-source domain adapta-
tion, involving re-weighting source domain instances based on both
instance and domain weights [ 23]. Feature representation transfer
maps data from diverse domains to a specific feature space, reduc-
ing domain divergence and model errors. Tzeng et al. introduced
an adaptation layer and an additional domain confusion loss to a
traditional CNN model, facilitating the learning of a representation
that is both semantically meaningful and domain-invariant. Dai
et al. advocated Co-Clustering-Based Classification for document
classification, incorporating a co-clustering algorithm to propagate
label information from the source to the target domain [ 4]. Parame-
ter transfer involves reusing model parameters from existing source
domain models to enhance performance in the target domain. Gao
et al. proposed a locally weighted ensemble learning framework to
combine multiple models of source domain, where the weights are
assigned based on a model’s predictive power on each test sample
in the target domain, rather than a global weighting for each model
[10]. Duan et al. presented a Domain Adaptation Machine frame-
work to construct a robust classifier for the target domain to ensure
similarity in decision values between the target classifier and rele-
vant base classifiers on unlabeled instances from the target domain
[7]. Relational knowledge transfer aims to transfer the relationships
among data from a source domain to a target domain. Mihalkova
et al. proposed a complete Markov Logic Networks transfer system
 
804KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Zhiying Feng, Qiong Wu, and Xu Chen
that transfers relational knowledge across relational domains as-
suming that the learner has access to information from the entire
graph [ 19] or only the bold relations are known to the learner [ 20].
DIet al. proposed Relation Extraction via Domain-aware Transfer
Learning, to extract relation mentions from a given text corpus byleveraging knowledge from existing databases [ 6]. Battaglia et al.
explored the integration of graph networks to capture relational
dependencies, underscoring the potential of relational approaches
in enhancing transfer learning [1].
