ABSTRACT
The rapid decline in groundwater around the world poses a sig-
nificant challenge to sustainable agriculture. To address this issue,
agricultural managed aquifer recharge (Ag-MAR) is proposed to
recharge the aquifer by artificially flooding agricultural lands us-
ing surface water. Ag-MAR requires a carefully selected flooding
schedule to avoid affecting the oxygen absorption of crop roots.
However, current Ag-MAR scheduling does not take into account
complex environmental factors such as weather and soil oxygen,
resulting in crop damage and insufficient recharging amounts. This
paper proposes MARLP, the first end-to-end data-driven control
system for Ag-MAR. We first formulate Ag-MAR as an optimiza-
tion problem. To that end, we analyze four-year in-field datasets,
which reveal the multi-periodicity feature of the soil oxygen level
trends and the opportunity to use external weather forecasts and
flooding proposals as exogenous clues for soil oxygen prediction.
Then, we design a two-stage forecasting framework. In the first
stage, it extracts both the cross-variate dependency and the periodic
patterns from historical data to conduct preliminary forecasting. In
the second stage, it uses weather-soil and flooding-soil causality to
facilitate an accurate prediction of soil oxygen levels. Finally, we
conduct model predictive control (MPC) for Ag-MAR flooding. To
address the challenge of large action spaces, we devise a heuristic
planning module to reduce the number of flooding proposals to
enable the search for optimal solutions. Real-world experiments
show that MARLP reduces the oxygen deficit ratio by 86.8% while
improving the recharging amount in unit time by 35.8%, compared
with the previous four years.

1 INTRODUCTION
Groundwater is an important resource for agricultural stability, for
example, providing up to 60% of the water supply in dry years for
California [ 20]. Due to recurring global droughts in recent years,
groundwater pumping has increased significantly, exceeding the
natural recharge rate and leading to insufficient water supply in un-
derground aquifers [ 29]. This poses a threat to the food security of
many regions [ 14,24]. Therefore, careful management and conser-
vation of groundwater resources are highlighted in many regions
worldwide. In California, the Sustainable Groundwater Manage-
ment Act (SGMA) has been introduced, aiming to achieve a balance
between extraction and recharge within the next 20 years [10].

Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is a technique used to redi-
rect excess surface water into underground aquifers during raining
seasons, helping to replenish groundwater sources and reduce the
impacts of excessive water withdrawal. This method is particularly
adopted in areas close to rivers where the land is primarily used
for farming, known as Agricultural Managed Aquifer Recharge
(Ag-MAR). Ag-MAR has been recognized as an effective method
for restoring water levels in depleted aquifers, enhancing the sus-
tainability of crop yield, as well as for other advantages such as
conditioning the soil before planting seasons and enhancing habi-
tats for bird populations [14, 35], as illustrated in Figure 1.
The effective implementation of Ag-MAR remains a challenging
problem. Flooding farmland reduces the soil‚Äôs oxygen content, as
water hinders the dissolution of oxygen, limiting its availability
to crop roots. Crops have specific tolerance thresholds for the soil
oxygen level; if the level drops below the threshold, the crop root
starts to decay, significantly damaging the crops. Consequently,
Ag-MAR needs to optimize two objectives at the same time, i.e.,
maximizing the amount of water recharged to the underground
aquifer while keeping the soil oxygen level above a predefined
threshold. We show examples of the soil oxygen level trends under
three different scenarios in Figure 2. From left to right of the figure:
first, if the flooding continues for an continuous long period, the soil
oxygen level continuously drops over the tolerance threshold for the
plant root, resulting in root rot and future yield reduction. Second,
if the water amount is slight, like sprinkler irrigation or light rain, it
may only achieve a balance with evapotranspiration (ET) (water lost
to air from soil surface and plants), resulting in insufficient aquifer
recharge. Finally, the optimized solution is to flood on intermittent
cycles, alternating between substantial flooding and drying periods
so that the oxygen can diffuse into the soil.
Ideally, such a schedule should take into account multiple pieces
of information, e.g., current soil oxygen level, future weather, and
soil type. Given that the water permeation through soil is a continu-
ous and long-lasting process, the effect of flooding actions can not be
evaluated immediately, but will result in a delayed, long-term effect.
Therefore, it is crucial to model and predict each flooding event‚Äôslong-term impact, along with potential environmental dynamics,
to determine the optimal flooding schedule. However, building an
accurate prediction and control method that considers all of the
above information remains an open challenge.
Analyzing our four-year real-world dataset in alfalfa fields1re-
vealed two key observations that motivate our design, which we
will describe in detail in Section 2. In short, we found out that:
‚Ä¢Soil oxygen exhibits a multi-periodicity pattern, modulated by
environmental factors and flooding actions.
‚Ä¢Due to the strong causality between weather-soil and flooding-
soil, exogenous clues such as weather forecasts and flooding
proposals can boost oxygen prediction.
In light of these observations, we devise MARLP, a model pre-
dictive control (MPC) system for Ag-MAR. The core is a causality-
aware long-term forecasting model that features a two-stage learn-
ing scheme. First, it integrates cross-variate and periodicity learning,
generating a preliminary self-consistent multi-variate forecasting.
In this step, environment-related periodicity is handled by segment-
ing the 1D data and reshaping them into a 2D format to facilitate
learning interperiod-variation, while the action-triggered periodic-
ity is filtered out. The exogenous clues are then used to calibrate
the oxygen prediction via a causality-aware projection module. By
combining them, the final oxygen prediction adapts well to the
fluctuating rhythms of environmental factors.
This predictive capability sets the stage for the subsequent MPC
workflow, which provides predictive outputs to any flooding pro-
posals for days in the future. The optimizer can accordingly choose
the best flooding strategy that both mitigates oxygen-deficit risks
and maximizes the recharging to the underground aquifer. How-
ever, due to the long forecast window, the total number of flood-
ing proposals is exponentially huge, which cannot be searched by
brute-force or approximation algorithms. To this end, we propose
a domain-specific heuristic planning module that filters the invalid
flooding proposals in advance. The number of proposals has been

reduced to thousands, making it practical for the system to iterate
all proposals and find the best in real-time.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of MARLP in predicting oxy-
gen variations and scheduling flood actions, we perform statistical
comparisons on past datasets, real-world control trials, and large-
scale simulations. The experimental results show that the proposed
algorithm and scheme outperform the state-of-the-art models and
can provide practical and trustworthy decisions.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
‚Ä¢We formulate the Ag-MAR optimization as a long-term model
predictive control problem and design a customized time-series
forecasting model that utilizes the external predictive input and
extracts the periodicity features of data traces.
‚Ä¢We propose MARLP, an MPC workflow based on the model. To
handle the large action space, we devise a heuristic planning
scheme, making the forecasting-based search practical.
‚Ä¢We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effective-
ness of MARLP on both recharging amounts and safety war-
ranty. We release the five-year dataset and code repository at
https://github.com/ycucm/kdd24_marlp.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Ag-MAR Optimization
Ag-MAR is the most applied MAR scheme for two primary reasons:
1) The nearby river areas are usually fully plotted with fields, and
applying water to these fields enables minimal water transportation;
2) the riverside fields typically represent the lowest points in the
area, ensuring minimal lift work. For the area of resource-demand
mismatch, Ag-MAR is carried out during the off-season when the
surface water flow is adequate [ 46], and crops are not in their active
growth phase.
Ideally, we should flood as much as possible into the field, but
excessive ponding will cause oxygen deficiency and root rot[ 50].
To coordinate these contradictory objectives, water use must be
intermittent, so that the soil can dry out and the oxygen level can
take time to recover, as shown in Figure 2. The control objective
is to maximize the amount of water recharged while maintaining
a healthy oxygen level for the root zone. So this problem could

be formulated as an optimization problem while the output is a
flooding decision series, indicating whether and how much water

Figure 3 shows the principle of how soil water content ( ùúÉ(ùëö3/ùëö3))
and oxygen percentage change within a flooding event. In the be-
ginning, the water saturates the soil and exceeds the surface, the
oxygen level drops because the water has squeezed the gas in the
soil (ùë°1toùë°2). This period continues after the valve is turned off. ùë°3
represents the turning point of the oxygen level, which
In our experimental field, after 10 minutes of turning on the
valve, the entire field surface would be flooded, i.e., the soil water
content reaches the peak value and the oxygen starts to drop since
no gas exchange may occur. The flooding lasts for ùë°ùë†in total, which
can be controlled by our strategy.
Why predicting for a long-term? To choose the best flooding
strategy that maximizes the water amount while reducing the risks
of oxygen-deficit situations, the consequences of applying water
should be accurately predicted, until the next time that the oxygen
level recovers to the dry level. Given that this recovery process
may be slowed by high atmosphere humidity or interrupted by
precipitation, the forecasting window should be long enough to
cover the entire recovery process.
2.2 Key Observations
Throughout our five-year in-field Ag-MAR dataset, exampled in
Figure 4, we‚Äôve revealed two key observations for helping long-term
prediction.
4864KDD ‚Äô24, August 25‚Äì29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Yuning Chen et al.
Observation 1. Soil oxygen exhibits a multi-periodicity pattern,
caused by different sources.
Daily periodicity: This dynamic is subject to the impact of
micro-biofunctions, whose behavior is modulated by environmental
conditions and our strategic flooding interventions, e.g., elevated
temperatures invigorate microbial activities. This leads to a more
rapid consumption of oxygen, especially during the day when the
temperature is at its zenith and microbial metabolic activities peak.
Overall, the multi-periodicity pattern makes the prediction task far
from interpretable and straightforward.
Action-triggered periodicity: Post saturation, the oxygen level
forms periodic V-curves after saturation, first drops, and then grad-
ually recovers, as shown in Figure 3.
Observation 2. There is a strong causality between flooding,
weather, and soil oxygen.
Precipitation affects soil oxygen levels by saturating the soil,
displacing air from pore spaces, and reducing aeration, leading to
anaerobic conditions that affect plant and microbial respiration.
Thus, predicting soil oxygen levels benefits from considering the
causality between weather and soil oxygen levels. Fortunately, mod-
ern weather forecasting reports that synthesize global atmospheric
modeling are becoming more and more reliable, especially in sce-
narios with sudden and severe rainfall events [ 32,73]. They can be
used as external clues to facilitate oxygen level inference.
3 LONG-TERM SOIL OXYGEN PREDICTION
In this section, we introduce a long-term time-series forecasting
model customized for soil oxygen prediction.
3.1 Model Overview
The model architecture is shown in Figure 5, consisting of three ma-
jor components: dependency extraction backbone, multi-periodicity
block, and causal projection. The iTransformer dependency learn-
ing backbone extracts the cross-variate and temporal dependencies.
The latent space representation is then passed towards the multi-
periodicity block to learn the inter- and intra-periodicity features.
To this end, a forecasting result would be produced, which is self-
consistent among all variates. Then the partially observable future
clues, i.e., future flooding and external weather forecasts, are uti-
lized to calibrate the oxygen prediction.
The historical records can be represented as X={ùíô1,..., ùíôùëá}‚àà
Rùëá√óùëÅ, withùëátime steps and ùëÅvariates. They are soil oxygen
concentration, soil water content, flooding history, and weather
records, i.e., air temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind
speed. Besides, some partially observable future clues are included,
specifically the flooding plan and weather forecasts for future ùëÜtime
steps Y={ùíô‚Ä≤
ùëá+1,..., ùíô‚Ä≤
ùëá+ùëÜ}‚ààRùëÜ√óùëÅ‚Ä≤. With both inputs, we predict
the oxygen in future ùëÜtime steps z={ùë•ùëá+1,...,ùë• ùëá+ùëÜ}‚ààRùëÜ√óùëÅ.
3.2 Multi-Periodicity Block
Periodicity lies inherently in real-world time series [ 63]. Due to
the lack of application contexts, existing works assume that the
periodicity would be kept. However, this is not always the case. The
action-triggered periodic patterns would change when the action
patterns are changed. Therefore, we identify the action-triggeredperiodicity in Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis and filter it out
in advance.
To harness the full potential of periodicity within other peri-
odic patterns, we adopt a structured approach, TimesBlock, to first
perform data segmentation and reorganization [ 63]. The data is
segmented according to the daily frequency bin in FFT results to
isolate periodic components, which are then reorganized into a 2D
format that aligns their intra-period indexes. In this reorganized
structure, each column of the tensor represents a discrete time
point within a single period, and each row correlates to the same
phase across different periods. This configuration allows the model
to differentiate and learn from both intra-period and inter-period
variations. This transformation overcomes the inherent limitations
of 1D time-series data representation, enhancing the learning of
temporal patterns in microbial activities. Inception blocks are then
implemented to extract and learn the periodicity from a specific
time segment period/frequency.
3.3 Causal Projection with Exogenous Clues
Trustworthy weather forecasts and flooding plans are partially ob-
servable factors of the future. To combine their insights with history-
inferred results, we compare them with preliminary weather and
flooding forecasting outputs from history-based prediction mod-
ules. Considering the temporal self-consistency of ùõºùëá+ùëõ‚ààùíô‚Ä≤

Œîùõºùëá+ùëõ=ÀÜùõºùëá+ùëõ‚àíùõºùëá+ùëõcan be leveraged to fill the confidence gap
betweenùõΩùëá+ùëõand the groundtruth if causality holds between them.
The causality between temperature, precipitation, soil water,
and oxygen holds intuitively and empirically. Discovering causal
relationships within dozens of sequential variates is relatively easy,
especially when their physical interpretations are specified. How-
ever, the challenge remains in leveraging this causality to enhance
time-series forecasting. We categorize the variables into three tiers
based on their causal relationships, where upper-tier variables cause
the subsequent lower-tier ones, which can‚Äôt be reversed. Flooding
and weather factors are in the top layer, followed by soil moisture in
the second layer, and soil oxygen in the bottom layer. After setting
the causal layers between variates, we apply Granger causality [ 54]
learning for each pair of variates to learn the parameters:
ŒîùõΩ(ùë°)=ùëù‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëó=1ùê¥ùëóŒîùõº(ùë°‚àíùëó)+ùëù‚àëÔ∏Å

whereùê∏(ùë°)is the residual, ùê¥ùëóandùê¥‚Ä≤
ùëóare linear parameters, we
only model the first-derivative causality since the context is clear,
e.g., increased soil water to reduce the oxygen diffusion speed,
higher temperature leads to faster soil water emission, etc. During
inference, we iterate through layers, up to bottom, to calculate ŒîùõΩ
for allùõΩwithout external clues, i.e., soil water and soil oxygen.
These values are utilized to calibrate raw outputs to achieve a new
consistency between soil oxygen forecasting and external clues.
3.4 Dependency Extraction Backbone
Understanding dependencies between soil oxygen levels and other
variables is crucial for predicting soil oxygen level. While transformer-
based methods excel at uncovering dependencies in time series,
they are less effective at identifying relationships across different

variables. To this end, inversed transformer (iTransformer) [ 38] is
adopted as the backbone to learn the dependencies among variables
via inversed layer normalization and attention mechanism.
The layer normalization is applied across time steps rather than
features, which preserves the distinct temporal dynamics of each
variable, ensuring the learning of the patterns inherent to the data.
The feed-forward networks serve to distill complex temporal fea-
tures from each variate, allowing the attention module to work
effectively. The attention mechanism of iTransformer is carefully
calibrated to work with the tokenized series of variates. It avoids the
traditional composite token format to enhance the model‚Äôs ability
to map out the dependencies among multiple variables. We modify
the decoder to be combined with the multi-periodicity block and to
be trained end-to-end.
In-situ Model Update. Considering distribution shifts between
regions, fields, and other environmental dynamics, we use the newly
collected data to adapt the forecasting model, which enhances the
scalability for wide adoption.
4 MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL
In this section, we integrate the prediction of soil oxygen into our
MPC workflow to guide the recharging actions.
4.1 Workflow
The workflow of MARLP is shown in Figure 2. The heuristic plan-
ning generates flooding traces with predefined rules and constraints
to propose potential flooding schedules. The long-term oxygen
forecasting module then incorporates historical data and weather
forecasts to simulate the consequential oxygen trace of all flooding
traces. These flooding proposals and the oxygen level predictions
are then analyzed by the optimizer according to the optimization
objective specified by Eq.1. Once the best flooding plan is identified,
the optimizer sends the actions to the actuator. The workflow can
be conducted again anytime, not necessarily after the plan is fully
executed.
To handle the errors in external clues like weather forecasts, we
have the decisions updated every 10 minutes to recalibrate them
timely, significantly reducing the impact of unexpected dynam-
ics. This scheduling interval can be adjusted to balance the timeli-
ness and the computation overhead. Note that agile re-scheduling
doesn‚Äôt conflict with the necessity of long-term forecasting because
flooding actions can never be revoked.4.2 Heuristic Planning
The essential part of MPC is to estimate the optimal flooding trace
among all flooding proposals, while not consuming an intolerable
amount of computation. Traditionally, this is done by adopting
stochastic searching methods such as shooting-based methods[ 4]
or cross-entropy methods[ 1]. Considering a planning period that
may extend beyond 120 hours, with a decision required every 10
minutes, the number of potential action sequences can reach 2720,
which is too large for a stochastic searching method to be effective.
To address this, we propose schemes based on an understanding of
saturating actions in the system. These schemes are derived from
two key principles:
(1)Flooding Duration Constraint: To ensure the effectiveness
of groundwater recharging, once flooding begins, it must continue
for at least a minimum duration before ceasing. This constraint can
be represented as:
‚àÄùë°‚ààùëá,(ùêπ(ùë°‚àí1)=0‚àßùêπ(ùë°)=1)‚áí
(‚àÄùúè‚àà[ùë°,ùë°+Œîùë°min_flood),ùêπ(ùúè)=1) (4)
‚àÄùë°‚ààùëá,(ùêπ(ùë°)=1)‚áí
(‚àÉùúè‚àà[ùë°,ùë°+Œîùë°max_flood),ùêπ(ùúè)=0) (5)
Here,ùêπ(ùë°)is a binary indicator function where ùêπ(ùë°)=1, if
flooding is occurring at time ùë°,ùëá, is the total observation time period,
andŒîùë°min_flood is the minimum required duration for continuous
flooding.
(2)Idle Period Duration Constraint: Between two floodings,
the idle interval must be long enough that the oxygen can effectively
diffuse, otherwise it should not take the interval, but should grasp
the chance to flood more. This constraint ensures an adequate
drying period for the soil oxygen recovery:
‚àÄùë°‚ààùëá,(ùêπ(ùë°‚àí1)=1‚àßùêπ(ùë°)=0)‚áí
(‚àÄùúè‚àà[ùë°,ùë°+Œîùë°min_idle),ùêπ(ùúè)=0) (6)
In this case, ùêπ(ùë°)=0indicates an idle (non-flooding) period at
timeùë°, andŒîùë°min_idle represents the minimum required duration
for the idle period to allow for soil aeration.
By implementing these constraints, we can mathematically de-
fine and enforce the necessary spacing between flooding and idle
periods within the MPC framework. By filtering out suboptimal
action traces, we significantly reduced the size of the search space

to several thousand traces, which can be effectively brute-forced to
find the optimal trace.
5 IN-FIELD EXPERIMENT SETUP
As shown in Figures 6 and 13, we build a real experimental testbed to
verify the effectiveness of MARLP in practical scenarios. It includes
sensory data collection, transmission and decision making modules.
These components function as a comprehensive in-field experiment
system that enables online evaluation of MARLP, offering more
precise and realistic insights than those obtained from simulations
or offline evaluations.
Sensor Data Collection: The oxygen and moisture sensors
are placed at critical points throughout the facility. These sensors
continuously measure real-time oxygen and moisture data, enabling
prompt adjustments to maintain optimal oxygen levels.
Sensor Data Transmission: The collected oxygen and moisture
data are transmitted to a central server through LoRa networks,
ensuring long-range, low-power wireless communication [ 66,67,
69]. The implementation details are in Appendix A. We configured
the transmission parameters to ensure that all measured sensory
data are accurately received by our central server [68, 70].
Inference Server. This server is configured on the cloud [ 65]
with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-11900KF CPU and an NVIDIA GEFORCE
RTX 3080 Ti GPU. It executes the MPC algorithm and forecasting
neural networks with continuously aggregated sensor data and
queried weather forecast data from open-source web API [ 48] in
real time.
System Overhead. The power consumption of each sensor
node for sensing and communicating is 64 mW, which can be easily
covered by a solar panel, mitigating the need to change batteries.
The gateway and server could be purchased as a service during
flooding seasons. Overall, the system requires less than $400 to
implement and $50/year to maintain, ensuring easy adoption, even
for small farms.
6 EVALUATION
We ask the following questions to evaluate MARLP through in-field
experiments and large-scale simulations:
RQ1 How effective is MARLP in predicting oxygen curves?
RQ2 How effective is MARLP in control performance?
RQ3 Can MARLP be effectively generalized across different soil
types, plant species, and weather patterns?
RQ4 How effective is each design component of MARLP?
To answer these questions, we evaluate the predictive capacity on
datasets of past years in Section 6.1 and assess the control perfor-
mance of MARLP during the in-field deployment in Section 6.2.

Then, we investigate the performance under different factors in
Section 6.3, followed by the ablation study in Section 6.4.
6.1 Predictive Capability
We choose four recent, representative and highly performed time-
series forecasting models as baselines: TimesNet [ 63], PatchTST [ 45],
DLinear [ 72], and iTransformer [ 38], covering convolutional, lin-
ear, and transformer-based methodologies. We evaluate all baseline
forecasting models on five datasets from five years within three
fields. The prediction sequence length is set as 720, which repre-
sents five days. Given the sensor reading interval of 10 minutes, the
forecasting window is 120 hours, which can fully observe oxygen
recovery in most cases. Table 2 shows dataset statistics, including
the collection area, period, flooding strategy, and sequence length.
Ag-MAR actions lie between growing seasons, which is roughly
from January to April for alfalfa in California, US. From 2020 to
2023, the field is flooded with constant intervals, e.g., once a week.
Trials in 2024 are controlled by MARLP.
Table 1 reports the MSE, MAE, as well as the mean absolute error
of the peak time (PTE) and peak value (PVE) among all forecasting
models. The unit of peak time error is an hour. In Table 1, it is
evident that MARLP consistently achieves the highest performance
(highlighted with red values) when incorporating weather fore-
cast data. This underscores the effectiveness of our long-term soil
oxygen prediction algorithm, which is vital for the MPC.
6.2 In-field Control Experiments
We perform the first in-field deployment of the Ag-MAR control
scheme, as illustrated in Section 5. The quality of control is evalu-
ated under two factors: oxygen deficit ratio (ODR) andrecharg-
ing amount. ODR calculates the ratio of time that the soil oxygen
level is below the safety threshold, which should be zero in ideal
cases. The best recharging amount may vary according to weather
conditions, so the optimal recharging amount can not be asserted,
instead, we can only compare the schemes with each other. All
in-field experiments are conducted in alfalfa fields, with the safety
threshold of oxygen concentration as 10%.
Table 3 compares the control performance of MARLP with the
weekly flooded scheme in 2020-2023 as the baseline. The weekly
flooded scheme resulted in an average oxygen deficit ratio of 2.72%,
while controlling with MARLP yields an ODR of 0.36%. At the same

time, MARLP increased the recharging amount (inch per week)
from 7.64to10.371, with a 35.8%improvement.Figure 8 provides an example of comparison between the weekly
flooding scheme and MARLP to show the reason behind the high
effectiveness of MARLP. The red and purple bars represent the
amount of precipitation and flooding, respectively. Each bar is 10
minutes wide, so the visual areas indicate the total amount of water
input. In Figure 8 (a), the weekly-based approach ignores the heavy
rain forecast after flooding, resulting in the unexpected oxygen
deficit below 10% on day 1 and day 8. At the same time, it misses
the opportunity to flood during days 3-6, when there is no rainfall.
Figure 8 (b) shows the performance of MARLP. On day 1 and day
2, when the rainfall is negligible, it conducts a 14-hour recharge
for 3.1 mm. The oxygen low peak is 10.16%, without exceeding the
safety threshold, as depicted by the red dashed line. Knowing the
heavy rain on day 4 of the forecast, it discarded aggressive proposals
and stopped flooding for 5 days to avoid danger. This shows that
MARLP can foresee the consequences of each proposal and avoid
risky flooding while making full use of flooding opportunities.
6.3 Large-scale Simulation
To evaluate the generalization capability of all prediction models,
we utilize a simulator to replicate a diverse array of factors, includ-
ing soil types, crop species, and regional climate.2Specifically, we
simulate the water content transition in the soil using HYDRUS [ 56],
a classical simulator for soil flux [ 6]. Then we model the oxygen
diffusion process, root respiration, and microbial respiration based
on empirical equations [ 13]. The evaluation targets the oxygen
deficit ratio and recharging amount in the simulation.

6.3.1 Impact of Soil Types. To check the generalizability of MARLP
on different soil, we mimic three representative soil types: sand,
loam, and silt according to the soil texture triangle defined by
USDA [ 58]. We simulate each soil texture as a testbed, where all
models are evaluated with MPC architecture the same as MARLP.
The crops and weather remain the same as in the 2023 in-field
experiment. Figure 9(a) shows that MARLP achieves the lowest oxy-
gen deficit ratio than the baselines for all three soil textures, and
Figure 9(b) shows that MARLP achieves a high recharging amount
at the same time. Although DLinear achieves a higher recharg-
ing amount on loam and slit, it performs significantly worse than
MARLP in terms of oxygen deficit ratio. The superior robustness
based on the causality-aware forecasting of MARLP holds on other
soil types. Note that the soil texture has a significant impact on
the general trend of the potential recharging amount because soil
with relatively high percolation rates can accelerate the atmosphere
exchange process.
6.3.2 Impact of Crop Species. We choose walnut trees, grapes and
almond trees, with distinct root densities, depths and oxygen-deficit
tolerances [ 47], to assess how the crop diversity influences the con-
trol performance. Walnuts and almonds are less tolerant to flooding
than alfalfa, hence they are more susceptible to high oxygen-deficit
ratio. Figure 10(a) shows that MARLP achieves the lowest oxygen-
deficit ratio than the baselines for all three crop species, and Fig-
ure 10(b) shows that MARLP achieves a high recharging amount
at the same time. Therefore, MARLP has the best generalization
capability among all methods.
6.3.3 Impact of Regional Climatic. Although California is at the
forefront of Ag-MAR adoption, this practice is becoming increas-
ingly popular in other parts of the world that face similar hydrologi-
cal challenges, particularly those with a Mediterranean climate. We

broaden its scope to include the High-Atlas region in Morocco [ 8]
and the Algarve region in Portugal [ 57], incorporating soil and
weather data from these diverse global regions that are actively
exploring Ag-MAR. The experimental periods for the simulations
are both Feb. 28th - Apr. 6th, 2023, aligning with our real-world
experiments in California. We use HYDRUS [ 56] to simulate the
soil dynamics of these two sites and use five models to conduct
flooding control separately, with the same goal settings. The results
are shown in Figure 11. The control performance of all models
exhibits drops since the High-Atlas encounters a few sharp precip-
itations due to high altitude, while Algarve is located by the sea,
with stronger daily periodicity. MARLP keeps achieving the best
control performance. It underscores the generalizability of MARLP
and its potential to be adapted worldwide.
6.4 Ablation Study
In this section, we systematically tested the performance of MARLP
by excluding each design module to evaluate their individual ef-
fectiveness. Additionally, we examined how each input variable
contributes to the system. These tests revealed the necessity of
involving these clues and casual strength between the soil oxygen
and each of them. We plot the mean and standard deviation of MSE
across all datasets.
Design module ablations. We construct ablated versions of the
model by substituting the iTransformer with a vanilla Transformer,
removing the periodicity block and the causal module. Figure 12(a)
illustrates that the performance of each ablated version diminishes,
with the version lacking the causal module experiencing the most
significant reduction. This decline is because of the pronounced
causality inherent in Ag-MAR data.

Impact of Input Features. Figure 12(b) shows the influence of
various inputs on the MSE of oxygen forecasting. The abbreviations
FH, SW, WH, WF, and FF represent flooding history, soil water
content, weather history, weather forecast, and future flooding,
respectively. All inputs play a pivotal role in enhancing the final
performance, with weather forecasts and future flooding making the
most significant contributions. Consequently, optimal forecasting
necessitates a synergistic integration of historical data.
Overall, this ablation study affirms the importance of each factor
in improving oxygen forecasting and underscores the significance
of causal-aware forecasting that incorporates external indicators.
7 DISCUSSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
Ag-MAR studies. Ag-MAR has been studied in terms of environ-
mental benefits and potential risks[ 6,24,30], the fitness of different
soil types, crops, and geological regions. The preliminary results
are positive and bring it towards global adoption [ 42]. However, its
current implementation is empirical [ 23], lacking a standardized
and automatic workflow to achieve the best flooding. Based on the
oxygen pattern analysis, MARLP provides a systematical solution
that can work seamlessly with sensor systems, without the need for
expert knowledge. Recent studies also illustrate that the oxygen-
deficit tolerance level is temperature dependent [ 7]. Future works
can integrate this feature to enhance the practicality of MARLP.
Multi-variate time-series prediction algorithms. The evo-
lution of multivariate time series prediction algorithms has been
marked by significant milestones, starting with the development of
the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model [ 9],
progressing through the use of recurring neural networks (RNN) [ 12,
27], and further evolving with the introduction of Transformer [ 59].
NS-Transformer [ 39] proposes series stationarization and de-stationary
attention to handle the distribution shift and boost the performance
of the Transformer on time-series prediction. Dish-TS [ 21] proposes
a general paradigm to alleviate distribution shifts in time series.
ESG [ 71] integrates learning pairwise correlations and temporal
dependency in one framework. iTransformer [ 38] optimizes the ex-
traction of temporal and cross-variate dependency by swapping two
modules. Instead of conducting universal forecasting, other works
focus on different objectives. TimesNet [ 63] and DEPTS [ 22] aims to
learn periodic patterns in time series. TSMixer [ 19] utilizes the MLP
architecture to reduce computing overhead. IPOC [ 11] innovates
with ensemble learning, offering real-time adaptable confidence
interval predictions. MARLP distinguishes itself with a two-stage
method that first predicts based on historical patterns, then utilizes
external clues for causality-aware calibration.
Causal discovery and inference for time-series data. Causal
relationship widely exists in sequence data, e.g., the classical causal-
ity between milk price and butter price [ 5]. Granger causality is
proposed to handle the delay of the causal impact [ 54]. [28] proposes
Bayesian forecasting with time-varying causal models, but it only
works for short terms. CASTOR [52] introduces time-lagged links
into GNN to enhance Granger causality modeling. REASON [ 62]
utilizes graph neural networks to extract layered causal relation-
ships. CORAL [ 61] is a framework that automatically updates the
root cause analysis model. Instead of discovering and quantifying
causality, our solution focuses on applying causality to long-term
time-series forecasting with external clues.Time-series forecasting for real applications. Time-series
forecasting is not only a critical question in agricultural practices,
but also vital in other industries such as electricity, weather, finance,
traffic, and human-computer interaction [ 37,40,41,53,60]. For
example, RAPT [ 53] performs a prediction on medical data for the
diagnosis of pregnancy complications. ClimODE [ 60] uses physics-
informed neural ODE to simulate global atmosphere dynamics for
climate forecasting. We will upgrade the sensor systems to enable
neural ODE on Ag-MAR oxygen modeling in future works.
MPC based on long-term forecasting. MPC has been used
for application scenarios from the microsecond-level horizon (e.g.,
embedded system voltage control [ 36]) to the hour-level horizon
(e.g., building control [ 2,4], grid control [ 44]). Existing works utilize
MPC for irrigation, but the planning horizon and forecast window
are less than one day [ 17,18]. Reinforcement learning [ 15,16,55]
based control can achieve effective control, but lacks reliability and
requires a large amount of data to converge, making it unsuitable
for Ag-MAR. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
MPC work to consider a planning horizon of several days.
Robustness and Efficiency. Robustness is a major concern for
applied machine learning [ 31,49,51]. The predicted state trajectory
generated as part of the MPC planning process allows the safety
check of the trajectory, which offers a higher level of reliability [ 3].
In future works, we may apply safe guarantee mechanisms like a
Gaussian-based uncertainty check[5], to achieve better tradeoffs
between reliability and efficiency. Furthermore, given the typically
extensive search spaces involved in real-world, long-term forecast-
ing control, efficiency becomes a pivotal aspect. Unlike RL, which
can separate agent models from environmental models to improve
efficiency [ 25,33,34], time series modeling offers limited scope
to balance performance with efficiency. However, recent advances
in state space models (SSM) have significantly mitigated computa-
tional burdens [ 26]. Future research could explore the application
of SSMs in scenarios where real-time requirements are critical.
8 CONCLUSION
This paper introduces MARLP, a model predictive control system
for Ag-MAR, employing heuristic planning and a long-term oxy-
gen forecasting module to optimize groundwater recharge and soil
oxygen levels. Benefiting from a causality-aware forecasting model,
MARLP effectively manages environmental variables in real-time,
enhancing water use efficiency in agriculture. The successful de-
ployment of MARLP, which reduces the oxygen deficit ratio and
improves the total amount of applied water, showcases the sys-
tem‚Äôs potential in precision agriculture and sustainable resource
management.

Figure 13: The illustration of the solar-powered sensor node.
The sensor node is powered by solar energy. As shown in Fig-
ure 13, it consists of several key components. The Arduino Uno
serves as the central controller, managing the operations of sen-
sor readings and LoRa signal modulation. It is connected to KE-25
oxygen sensors and IRROMETER Watermark 200SS soil moisture
sensors, which are deployed in the soil. The InAir9B LoRa radio
is connected to the Arduino Uno via a relay board, which enables
low-power long-range communication. The rechargeable battery
along with the solar charger ensures minimum maintenance efforts.
Key components are hosted in the waterproof box to protect them
from damage and fast aging caused by environmental factors. The
spreading factor (SF) [64] of the LoRa transmission is 8.
