ABSTRACT
When a customer overdraws their bank account and their balance is
negative they are assessed an overdraft fee. Americans pay approx-
imately $15 billion in unnecessary overdraft fees a year, often in
$35 increments; users of the Mint personal finance app pay approxi-
mately $250 million in fees a year in particular. These overdraft fees
are an excessive financial burden and lead to cascading overdraft
fees trapping customers in financial hardship. To address this prob-
lem, we have created an ML-driven overdraft early warning system
(ODEWS) that assesses a customer’s risk of overdrafting within the
next week using their banking and transaction data in the Mint app.
At-risk customers are sent an alert so they can take steps to avoid
the fee, ultimately changing their behavior and financial habits.
The system deployed resulted in a $3 million savings in overdraft
fees for Mint customers compared to a control group. Moreover,
the methodology outlined here is part of a greater effort to pro-
vide ML-driven personalized financial advice to help our members
know, grow, and protect their net worth, ultimately, achieving their
financial goals.

Overdraft fees largely fall on the most vulnerable customers, of-
ten living paycheck-to-paycheck, and are considered excessive and
exploitative[ 28]. Americans typically pay $15 billion a year in avoid-
able overdraft fees. The same 9% of customers pay 80% of overdraft
fees, often paying more than 10 overdraft fees in a year. Overdrafts
can be considered a way to monetize accounts with small depos-
itory amounts[ 10]. Moreover, overdraft fees can discourage the
most vulnerable customers from even participating in the banking
system due to the high cost of banking by incurring these fees[ 9].
An overdraft fee is charged by the bank for accepting a transac-
tion when there are insufficient funds; a non-sufficient fund fee is
charged for denying a transaction when there are insufficient funds.
When an overdraft or non-sufficient fund fee is charged depends on
a bank’s terms of service. For this work we use the term overdraft
fee for both types of fees as we are interested in preventing both.
An account can be overdrawn in one of five ways due to insuffi-
cient funds: a check is denied (bounce a check), electronic debit,
debit card transaction, ATM withdrawal, or in person withdrawal.
Originally, overdraft fees were a rare occurrence. The bank would
charge a fee to customers who had not properly balanced their
checkbook. With the popularization of debit transactions and elec-
tronic bill payments, overdraft fees have ballooned into a billion
dollar revenue stream for banks. This is how a $5 coffee transaction
can become a $40 transaction or a $15 electronic bill payment can
become a $50 bill payment. Ultimately, this can lead to cascading
overdraft fees, creating a financial burden, and trapping customers
in a cycle of fees and low balances.
There has been a patchwork of temporary and uneven measures
to combat overdraft fees. During the Covid-19 pandemic many
banks granted waivers to customers who knew to request them
while some banks waived overdraft fees for all customers temporar-
ily. There has also been legislation proposed in the United States,
2021 Stop Overdraft Profiteering Act [6], but not passed. AI tools
mostly focus on financial markets–explainable AI for trading[ 18],
trading strategies[ 17], risk management[ 30], and fraud detection[ 26,
29] rather than personal finance.
In [19], a Bayesian hierarchical model is proposed to find an
optimal overdraft fee structure as a percentage of the overdrawn
amount. In [ 22] an ML-framework for identifying how many over-
drafts a customer should be allowed and what the cost should be
is proposed. There have also been retrospective economic studies
on the impact of overdrafts and predatory lending[ 3,21] and the
positive benefits of providing SMS notifications for overdrafts and
loan repayments[ 7]. In the behavioral sciences, there has been work
on finding effective nudge messaging to reduce overdrafts[5].

Figure 1: Overdraft Fees paid by Mint Customers per Bank from 09-2019–09-2020. On average Mint customers pay $250 million
in Overdraft Fees to banks often in $35 increments. The share of overdraft fees collected by banks scales linearly with the
number of customers. The goal of ODEWS is to provide a customer with an early warning to prevent paying unnecessary
overdraft fees.
There are several challenges in preventing overdrafts fees that
make it suitable for an ML-driven solution. Firstly, different banks
have different policies regarding the cost of the overdraft fee, the
number of overdraft fees that can be charged to a customer in a day,
the grace period an account can be made current, different thresh-
olds until an overdraft fee is assessed, and different fees for different
types of overdrawing an account[ 12]. A ML-based model can learn
these policies per bank and adapt to changes over time. Secondly,
banks order transactions in order of largest amount transaction to
lowest amount transaction during nightly processing (known as
Transaction Processing Order) which can make it difficult to predict
an overdraft. Although the Mint app receives balance and transac-
tion data, the app does not receive the data in real time, oftentimes
there can be a delay of hours to days depending on the financial
institution. The transaction processing order and lag in receiving
data rule out the possibility of simply waiting for a pending trans-
action to appear, calculating whether the transaction will place a
customer in a negative balance, and then alerting the customer be-
fore the transaction is posted or using a time-series model. Instead,
an ML-model can leverage financial data and predict if a customer
is going to overdraft. Finally, we are seeking to quantify the risk of
a customer overdrawing their account. There are a constellation
of factors that lead to an overdraft besides a point-in-time balance
and debits that can be leveraged in a systematic and structured way
using an ML-model to provide an individualized measure of risk,
ranking of customers based on risk, and even inform the type of
intervention.
1.1 Our Contribution
In light of temporary and uneven measures from banks, stalled
legislative efforts, and other challenges in preventing overdraft fees,
the authors have created an ML-driven Overdraft Early Warning
System (ODEWS) on the Mint app. The problem has been cast asID Total

a binary classification problem where the system predicts a cus-
tomer’s likelihood of overdrawing their checking account in the
next week by leveraging platform and transaction data. At-risk
customers are then provided an early warning through email noti-
fication to prevent overdrafts and ultimately save our customer’s
money. This work builds on prior work of [ 5] by focusing on the
ML-aspects of assessing the risk of overdrafting and providing an
effective intervention. In addition to theoretical models that pro-
pose percentage fee structures[ 19] and alternative overdraft pricing
strategies [ 22], the ODEWS system focuses on preventing overdrafts
and has been deployed, tested, and shown to successfully prevent
overdrafts. Moreover, the authors chose to focus on overdrafts due
to their large impact on our customers, but this framework can be
adopted for preventing other types of junk fees as well. An example
of the output of the model is shown in Table 1, where customers
are ranked by their risk of overdrafting. The risk score is the output
of the model. The highest at-risk of overdrafting are then sent a
notification to prevent the overdraft.
1.1.1 Scope of Overdraft Problem. Since the time of this work and
current time of this writing several banks have reduced overdraft
5273Know, Grow, and Protect Net Worth: Using ML for Asset Protection by Preventing Overdraft Fees KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
fees, adopted less punitive policies, and a few smaller banks have
outright eliminated the fees[ 4]. Despite this positive change, many
of the largest banks are still charging overdraft fees and overdraft
fees still remain an unnecessary drag on a customer’s cash flow.
In 2019, overdraft revenue was estimated to be $12 billion, now
it is estimated to be a $9 billion revenue generator[ 10]. In a re-
cent survey by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[ 10], low-
income households are charged overdrafts fees (34% of households
with $65,000 in income) at a much higher rate compared to higher-
income households (10% of households with $175,000 in income);
most households that have incurred an overdraft fee could have
used a credit card if they had been given a warning. The authors,
therefore, believe that the prevention of overdraft fees and junk
fees in general are still an important part of asset protection.
1.2 Overdraft Problem for Mint Customers
The Mint app is a personal finance app with 20 million users in the
United States and Canada that tracks customer’s transactions by
linking their bank accounts, credit cards, and investment accounts;
the app also provides budgeting tools, forecasting, and personal
finance insights1. A decrease in unnecessary overdraft fees paid
by Mint customers is a significant savings that protects our cus-
tomer’s cash flow–especially for those who are living paycheck-
to-paycheck. Mint users pay on average $250 million dollars in
unnecessary overdraft fees every year. The average customer over-
drafts 1.8 times before they are aware they overdrafted their account.
Before this project, Mint customers would incur overdraft fees with-
out warning. Figure 1 shows the breakdown of overdraft fees of
Mint customers across nine banks over the period 9/2019-9/2020.
Typically, the amount of fees collected scales with the number of
customers with the largest three American banks, Chase, Bank of
America, and Wells Fargo, collecting the largest share.
ODEWS was deployed during the Covid-19 pandemic which saw
a sudden and extreme shock on the American economy. Suddenly,
many Americans were unemployed and businesses were shuttered,
leading to a precipitous decline in economic activity. As Figure 2
shows, there was a sudden decrease in overdrafts at the beginning of
the pandemic, approximately 03-2020, due to a sudden decrease in
transaction volume as a result of shutdowns caused by the pandemic.
Secondly, banks modified their overdraft policies to temporarily
suspend overdrafts or adopt more lenient overdraft policies. In this
case both the behavior of the customer as well as overdraft policies
were changing lending itself to an ML-solution that is adaptable to
a rapidly changing environment.
2 DATA SOURCES
The data used for this work is derived from a customer’s banking,
platform, and transaction data collected by the Mint app (Figure 3).
Customers can link their bank accounts, credit cards, investment
accounts, and loans to the app to receive a panoramic view of their
finances and receive financial insights. Data security policies can
be found at security.intuit.com. Mint has 3.6 million monthly active
users with transaction history for customers that can range from
1As the time of this writing, the Mint app is currently being merged with the Intuit
Credit Karma app where these features will be migrated.three months to over a decade depending on how long the customer
has used the app.
2.0.1 Banking. The Mint app allows customers to link their fi-
nancial accounts. This includes checking and savings accounts,
CDs, money market accounts, credit card accounts, and investment
accounts as well as their respective balances.
2.0.2 Platform. Platform data includes the number of logins a user
has in the Mint app as well as clickstream regarding what pages they
access in the app. The number of logins is a measure of intent and
proxy for how closely a customer monitors their finances[ 11,13].
Our reasoning is that if a customer has logged into Mint recently
they have likely assessed their finances and therefore at lower risk
of overdrafting.
2.0.3 Transaction History. As part of linking financial accounts to
the app, Mint will fetch the transaction history of customers. This
includes the transaction timestamp, amount, transaction descrip-
tion, and transaction category.
2.0.4 Data Limitations. The main limitation of the data is due to
the velocity the Mint app receives the latest banking and transac-
tion data. The time from when a transaction is made and transits to
the Mint app can be anywhere from hours to days. Several banks
require customers to log-in to Mint, provide a two-factor authenti-
cation, and then the app can fetch the latest transactions. Moreover,
several banks do not provide data over the weekend while transac-
tion processing is occurring, which can lead to scenarios where a
customer can spend over the weekend and not realize they have
overdrafted until transaction processing is complete on Monday
morning. Secondly, Mint bank balance data also has a lag that is
often slower than the velocity that the app receives the latest trans-
action data. This can lead to scenarios where the app believes a
customer has a positive balance but in actuality they have a negative
balance and are actively overdrafting their account.
3 METHODOLOGY
This section describes the overall methodology from extracting
features for training, selecting and evaluating machine learning
models. The unit of prediction is a customer and checking account
on a given day. The majority of customers have a single checking
account. There are a set of features derived from the customer as
well as a set of features derived from the transaction history of the
checking account.
The label of whether a customer has overdrafted is derived by
searching through transaction history. Each bank has their own
unique transaction descriptions to indicate whether a fee has been
assessed. Searching through transaction history through manual
curation and keyword search, we were able to identify the trans-
action descriptions that indicate an account was overdrawn and
match the description to a bank based on the origin of the account.
On the (simulated) day of prediction, we look-forward one week
to search through customer transaction history and find any over-
draft fee transactions. If any overdraft fees are found then this is
a positive label (overdrafted within the next week) otherwise the
customer/account is given a negative label (did not overdraft in the
next week).

Figure 2: Overdrafts per Week from 09-2019–09-2020. The Covid-19 pandemic saw mass shutdowns which led to a precipitous
decline in the number of overdrafts due to a precipitous decrease in the number of transactions as well as changes in bank
overdraft policies. As the pandemic progressed the number of overdrafts gradually increased. The rapid change in overdrafts
due to changing customer behavior as well as changing bank policies makes the problem of preventing overdrafts well suited
to an adaptable machine-learning based solution.
Figure 3: The Mint app is used for tracking a customer’s
transactions and managing their finances. Customers can
link their savings, checking, and investments accounts and
see their transaction history.The features of the model can be divided in several feature groups:
overdraft features, transaction features, bank features, and login
features. Overdraft features are related to a customer’s history
of overdrafting and are the most important features of the model.
Generally, if a customer has ovedrafted before they are at a high risk
of overdrafting again, especially if they have already ovedrafted in
the same week. The overdraft features are the number of ovedrafts
in the last six months in the account, number of overdrafts across all
accounts in the last six months, days since the last ovedraft, amount
of the last ovedraft, and whether there has been an overdraft in
the last week. The bank features provide a panoramic view of
how many accounts a customer has indicating a level of financial
complexity. The bank level features are the number of checking
accounts, credit card accounts, savings accounts, CD accounts, and
investment accounts on the day predictions are made. Transaction
features are related to the amount of debit and credit transactions
in a checking account as well as the amounts, the balance of a
checking account, and changes in the bank account balance. The
account activity is predictive of the risk of overdrafting. The account
level features are the last known balance in the account before the
day of prediction as well as transaction activity before the day
of prediction. Due to fetching both transactions and balances at
different times, customer balances can often be out of sync of the
true balance. To address this problem a new balance is calculated by
fetching the last known balance, transactions that were made after
the last known balance timestamp, and calculating a new balance.
The transaction history of an account is converted into features by
first dividing transactions into credit and debits and creating the
following features: the total number of credit and debit transactions,

min, max, and average amounts over a four-week and one-week
look back window from the day of prediction; the number of debit
transactions under $50 as well the number of credits over $200
over the last two months from the day of prediction. Different look-
back windows were tested for different features. Looking back six
months provides a comprehensive look of a customer’s overdraft
history, including the number of overdrafts, days since the last
overdraft, and number of days since last overdraft. If, say, a one-
month look back window was used, the model would be unable to
separate chronic overdrafters from occasional overdrafters which
would increase our false positives. Additionally, there could be a
customer that recently overdrafted but may have not overdrafted
in the previous six months. The model would find this customer at
medium-to-low risk looking back six-months and likely not be in
the at-risk pool. The look-back windows for features reported here
provided the best model performance.
4 MODELING APPROACH AND RESULTS
The cohort of interest that receives a prediction are Mint customers
who have overdrafted at least once in the last six months and have
a checking account from the following banks: Chase Bank, Bank
of America, Wells Fargo, US Bank, TD Bank, Citibank, PNC Bank,
Navy Federal Credit Union, and Ally Bank. (Note: At the time of
this deployment Citibank and Ally Bank were charging customers
overdraft fees. They have since eliminated overdraft fees at the time
of this writing. Now, each bank will simply deny transactions at
their discretion based on their respective overdraft policies[ 1,2]).
Many Mint customers likely have overdraft protection coverage
where if an overdraft occurs, rather than being charged a fee, the
bank will draw funds from the customer’s savings account, line
of credit, or charge a credit card. In an ideal world, all customers
would have overdraft protection to avoid overdrafts fees. This is
not possible for several reasons. A customer may not have a savings
account to link with a checking account; a customer may also not
have a line of credit or credit card available to cover an overdraft.
Moreover, it may not be financially prudent to charge an overdrawn
amount to a credit card and pay the interest on the debt or associ-
ated fees. We do not have insight into which customers have this
type overdraft protection and which do not. To prevent sending
overdrafts warnings to customers with overdraft protection we re-
strict our cohort to customers who have overdrafted in the last six
months and assume they have no overdraft protection since they
have received an overdraft fee. There is a trade off to this approach
where any customer who overdrafts for the first time in the last
six months will not be in the prediction cohort. Although we are
missing a small portion of overdraft fees through this conservative
approach, we are avoiding false positive notifications ensuring cus-
tomers have faith in the system when they do receive a notification.
If a customer were to enable overdraft protection while being in
the cohort, they would decrease in risk as time went on and fall out
of the high-risk list of customers. For new customers, we typically
receive three months worth of transaction history from the bank
when they sign-up and they would be subject to the same criteria.
The goal of the model is to predict if a customer will overdraft
within the next week; to that end, the model calculates predictions
every Friday afternoon. We currently do not make a point-of-timeprediction after a transaction is made or a daily prediction due to
technical limitations with how quickly the app receives transaction
data. Also due to limitations with fetching data from banks, the Mint
app receives transaction at different cadences from banks leading to
performance differences for each bank compared to historical offline
testing. Moreover, even if our system could predict if a customer was
going to overdraft that day or the next, the customer often cannot
change their behavior quickly enough to prevent the overdraft
(based on customer interviews). The system, therefore, focuses on
predicting the risk of overdraft over a one week window of time
to allow customers sufficient time to change their behavior, and
the authors saw good performance of the model using this label.
Focusing on a longer time window such as a two-week window
may be too much time and a customer may not feel the urgency to
take corrective action. After the model generates predictions, a list
of at-risk customers is created and they are sent an email notifying
them we believe they are about to overdraft. This then provides the
customers the opportunity to adjust their spending, transfer money,
or contact the bank for a waiver. Due to diverging overdraft policies
of different banks, particularly during the height of the Covid-19
pandemic, a separate model was created for each individual bank.
Initially, we explored having a single model to predict overdrafts for
all banks but found the model was learning the overdraft policies of
the largest banks, hurting the performance for customers belonging
to smaller banks. Rather than trying different sampling strategies
the authors decided to create a model per bank, particularly to catch
acute changes to overdraft policies by individual banks. Empirically,
this provided better performance.
4.0.1 Temporal Cross-Validation: The model training scheme is de-
signed to mimic the deployment process in order to have the most
accurate performance results. The model is trained using temporal
cross-validation to take into account temporal effects and serial
correlations that affect customer behavior (features) and overdraft
policies (labels)[ 15]. As can be seen from Figure 2 and previously
stated, during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic there were
extreme exogenous shocks in customer behavior and overdraft poli-
cies. The model is retrained every week to take into account any
temporal effects such as shutdowns, re-openings, government stim-
ulus payments[ 14], and changes in overdraft policies that would
affect overdraft behavior. An example of temporal cross-validation
is the following: if simulating making a prediction on 2020-06-14
the label is calculated between the dates 2020-06-07–2020-06-14
and features are calculated looking back six months from the date
2020-06-07. The test-set of the model is then calculated using a label
from 2020-06-14–2020-06-21 and features looking back six months
from 2020-06-14. In this way, train-test pairs are created every week
over six months and used to train models.
4.0.2 Model Selection: The system has the following high-level
requirements.
(1)The system needs to be trusted by the user for it to be ef-
fective. In this context, the customer needs to understand
intuitively why they received the message if they are a false
positive so they have trust in the system.
(2)Our goal is to reach the largest group as possible to prevent
overdrafts.

ing a prediction on 2020-06-14 the label is calculated between
the dates 2020-06-07–2020-06-14 and features are calculated
looking back six months from the date 2020-06-07. The test-
set of the model is then calculated using a label from 2020-
06-14–2020-06-21 and features looking back six months from
2020-06-14. In this way, train-test pairs are created every
week over six months and used to train models taking into
account temporal effects and serial correlations.
(3)The overdraft email notification is one of many different
notifications customers receive (e.g., large expenses, payday,
credit card offers, late fees, etc). A product requirement is
to roughly keep the amount of notifications constant every
week so one notification does not flood customers inbox over
others, meaning there is a roughly fixed k of users that are
notified.
Different classification methods (Logistic Regression, Decision
Trees, Random Forests Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, and Neural
Nets), hyperparameters, training data time ranges, and feature sets
were compared to each other using precision@k%, recall@k%[ 25],
as well as model stability over time. A full model grid and hyper-
parameter set can be found in Table 3. Rather than optimizing the
model for an aggregate metric such as AUC, the local precision-
recall space is optimized to maximize the number of customers that
will overdraft in the top k% and provide an accurate measure of the
performance of the deployed model. Precision@k% and recall@k%
are metrics commonly found in information retrieval and search
engine literature[ 15] where it is important that the items flagged at
the top of a list are accurate. It is appropriate for our requirements
because we can only send roughly the same number of notifica-
tions each week, a requirement of the email system. Therefore, the
system has to maximize the precision@k% and recall@k% of the
top k% to reach the largest audience. When using metrics such as
precision@k% and recall@k%, NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cu-
mulative Gain) is often calculated as well to quantitatively measure
if the relevant customers or items are at the top of a predicted list.
NDCG does not apply in this particular instance because we have
no need to have a well-ordered list at k. All customers in our at-risk
at k list regardless of where they are in the list will get an email
notification.
The model informs which customers will receive an email inter-
vention. An email is a low-cost intervention allowing considerable
flexibility regarding who receives an email as well as how many
emails can be sent every week. The only resource requirement is
that the number of overdrafts messages is roughly constant each
week due to there being a number of other email campaigns and
the requirements of the system. This notification is one of manythat customers receive (e.g., large expense, payday, credit offers,
late fees etc). To guide how many notifications are sent we have
to consider the costs of false positive and false negative cases. A
false positive message can inure the customer to future messages
and make them lose trust in the system. The risk of a false negative
case is a customer does not receive a notification and overdraws
their account.
Models were selected with the goal to maximize precision@k%
and recall@k% at the highest k%. To that end, models were selected
where 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 @𝑘%≈0.4−0.5and𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 @𝑘%≈0.4−0.5to bal-
ance precision and recall. False positives and false negatives were
implicitly balanced in this approach and assumed to be equally
harmful. For the banks Wells Fargo, Chase Bank, US Bank, Navy
Federal Credit Union, TD Bank and Citibank models that balanced
precision@k% and recall@k% were found. In cases where preci-
sion@k% and recall@k% could not be easily balanced–Bank of
America, PNC Bank, Ally Financial–precision@k% was favored
and set to 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 @𝑘%≈0.4−0.5to minimize false positives
and maintain trust in the system. If the authors had maximized the
recall@k%, the large amount of false positive notifications would
have led to a loss in trust in the system. The k%, percentage of
customers each week that receive a notification, precision@k%,
recall@k% and model type can be found in Table 2. For complete-
ness the AUC of the models used is reported in Table 5 and the
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 @𝑘% and 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 @𝑘% are reported for Chase Bank across
the different algorithms in Table 6. Figure 5, shows a specific ex-
ample for Chase Bank. In this case the threshold of k% is set at 10%
and precision@k% is 0.42 and recall@k% is 0.45, roughly balancing
the precision@k% and recall@k%. For 8 of the 9 banks, a GBDT
(Gradient Boosted Decision Trees)[ 16] model was the most perfor-
mant model and the best performing model for Ally Financial was a
Feed Forward Neural Net. The authors considered using a risk score
cutoff or a top k cutoff for the model. In the end, we found both to
be equivalent; the top k cutoff corresponded with a risk score cutoff
and was stable over time. Model hyperparameters and architecture
can be found in Table 4. As is common in problems assessing risk,
boosting largely performed better than deep learning methods[ 23].
To understand if a sophisticated ML-system was worth deploying,
each bank’s model was compared to the bank’s Bayesian prior of
ovedrafting and a rules-based baseline. Overall, each model had a
4-15x lift compared to the prior. Since there is no current process
for preventing overdrafts, a 2-deep decision tree was created for
each bank to simulate the best business rule that can be found.
Comparing each model to a 2-deep decision tree model, each model
has a 1.17-2x lift compared to the 2-deep decision tree, showing the
model was worth deploying. Full details can be found in Table 2.
Another aspect of the model that was important to optimize is
balancing performance and stability over time. As figure 7 shows
different models had different levels of variance and performance
over time which can lead to large variances in performance week
over week. Through temporal-cross validation we are able to mea-
sure the model performance over time after choosing how many
customers, k%, the model will flag. The final model selected is
chosen for having the best performance over the last four weeks
compared to the best possible performance of all models trained
and being within 5% of the precision of the best possible model

Figure 5: Precision and Recall @k% for Chase Bank Model:
The model informs who and how many people receive an
email notification. There is considerable flexibility in how
many notifications can be sent every week since there are no
resource constraints. Models are selected trying to balance
precision and recall. In this case the threshold of k% is set at
10% and precision@k% is 0.42 and recall@k% is 0.49, roughly
balancing the precision@k% and recall@k%. The Chase Bank
model has a 5x lift from the prior and 1.17x lift from business
rules.
within the last four weeks. This method ensures both stability and
performance.
4.0.3 Feature Importances: Feature importances were calculated
using Gini Importance[ 20]. The top feature is the number of over-
draft fees a customer has had in the past. This largely makes intu-
itive sense. Customers that are living paycheck-to-paycheck and
have become accustomed to overdrafting are likely to continue
overdrafting. Though, having a history of overdrafts is not solely
predictive of overdrating an account in the next week. There is
a moderate correlation between this feature and other overdraft
features such as average number of overdrafts each week. Sec-
ondly, the days since the last overdraft fee and if there has been
an overdraft in the last week are also important. The average Mint
customer overdrafts 1.8x before they realize they have overdrafted.
The feature days since last overdraft was weakly correlated with all
other features. The model can often identify customers that have
had a recent overdraft and alerts them before they have more. A
large amount of debits indicates a highly active account where an
overdraft is more likely. Debit features were moderately correlated
with other debit and credit features. Customers typically spend after
they have deposited into the accounts. Interestingly, the number of
debit features were not correlated with the number of overdrafts.
Figure 6: Feature Importances of Chase Overdraft Model.
Feature importance is calculated using Gini importance. The
top features of the Chase model (GBDT) are the number of
times a customer has overdrafted, days since the last over-
draft, whether they have overdrafted this week and the sum
of debit transactions in the past week. These features are
largely what was intuitively expected. If customers are regu-
larly overdrafting, have low balances, or have already over-
drafted in the week we expect the customer is at high risk of
overdrafting again.
Figure 7: Balance Stability and Performance: Different mod-
els have different levels of variance and performance over
time which can lead to large variances in performance week
over week. Through temporal-cross validation we are able
to measure the model performance over time after choosing
how many customers, k%, the model will flag. The final model
selected is chosen for having the best performance over the
last four weeks compared to the best possible performance
of all models trained and being within 5% of the precision of
the best possible model within the last four weeks.
Our expectation was the accounts with the most active debits would
be the most at-risk of overdrafts. A low or already negative balance
is also a high-risk indictator of an impending overdraft but not per-
fectly predictive. Certain banks will allow customers to hold a small
negative balance, typically below $50 dollars before an overdraft fee
is assessed. Balance features were strongly correlated with other
balance related features and moderately correlated with credit and
debit features as would be expected because credit and debits are
what affect the balance. On the low risk end, if a customer has low

their account.
5 EMAIL VARIANTS
Different variants of an email message were composed using nudge
theory[ 8,27] and tested in order to find the most effective messag-
ing, as measured by email open rates. Three variations of overdraft
warnings were composed: “Overdrafts Happen. Here’s how to beat
it” (Empowering Message), “Avoid paying overdraft fees of $35 or
more" (Loss Aversion Message), and “Overdraft Early Warning"
(Baseline Message). As Figure 8 shows, the subject line contains the
nudge message. The body of the email contains the bank name of
the account we believe the customer is at risk of overdrawing and
the last time a customer received an overdraft fee. The bank name
is provided so the customer knows what account we believe they
will overdraw; for legal reasons that is the extent we can identify
an account via email. Receiving a notification with the last over-
draft fee date helps customers understand, intuitively, why they
are receiving the message. There is also a list of actions we suggest
to customers to avoid an overdraft.
6 MODEL TEST DESIGN AND RESULTS
The Overdraft Early Warning System was deployed and tested in an
RCT (randomized control trial) to test the system’s ability to reduce
overdraft fees. The null hypothesis is that the model cannot identify
customers about to overdraft better than random and the email
intervention has no effect on preventing overdrafts. The test was
run for 12 weeks from November 2020–January 2021. The model
was retrained every Friday and subsequently used to generate a
list of at-risk customers who were sent email notifications. For the
test, customers were divided into four groups: control (at-risk but
receive no notification) and a group for each of the three email
variants, Baseline Message group, Loss Aversion Message group,
and Empowering group. A customer is randomly assigned to one
of the groups the first time they receive a notification and stay
in that group for the duration of the test when receiving futurenotifications. Overall 200k notifications were sent and there were
60k participants in the test (48K in an email variant and 12k in
control). As previously mentioned there is a lag in the velocity the
Mint app receives the latest transaction data. In offline historical
testing we measured a precision of 40%-45% for each bank’s model
(Table 2) where there is no data lag. We would therefore expect
on average 45% of customers in the test to overdraft each week
during model deployment. In the control group, the percentage of
customers that overdrafted each week was approximately 27%. We
attribute this performance difference to the lag in transaction data
we receive at the time of prediction. Notably, users in the treatment
group who had never opened an email had similar overdraft rates
as the control group. In these cases, emails from the Mint app may
be summarily ignored or not reach the recipient (e.g., sent to the
spam filter). The overall email open rate across all three variants
was 24%. Of the users who opened an email, there was a 3.71%
(trending) reduction in customers overdrafting compared to the
control group indicating the customer took some action or was
mindful of overdrawing their account over the next week. Each
email also contained a link to a user’s checking account on the Mint
app. Of those users who clicked the link to see their balance, there
is a 12.86% reduction in customers overdrafting compared to the
control group (statistically significant p < 0.05), indicating these
users monitored their balances and likely took action to prevent
overdrafts over the next week.
An important goal of the system is to promote behavior change
among customers that led to reducing overdrafts. Users were tracked
for three months from when they received their first email. Many
certified financial planners suggest that it takes approximately three
months for a new financial habit to develop. Overall, there was an
estimated savings of $3 million dollars for customers in overdraft
fees in the treatment group compared to control. There was also
a $5 difference in the average overdrafts fees per customer in the
treatment group compared to the control group.
The purpose of creating and testing email variants is to find
the most effective messaging. The results of the test support that
customers who open the email are likely to have a reduction in
overdrafts. A message that resonates and prompts the customer
5279Know, Grow, and Protect Net Worth: Using ML for Asset Protection by Preventing Overdraft Fees KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
to action is therefore an important part of the system. The clear
winner with a 30% open rate is the Baseline Message, "Overdraft
Early Warning", compared to Empowering (21%), "Overdrafts Hap-
pen Here’s how to beat it", and Loss Aversion (22%), "Avoid paying
overdraft fees of $35 or more." The authors speculate that the sim-
ple message, “Overdraft Early Warning”, has a higher open rate
because the message communicates that an overdraft is imminent
and requires immediate action as opposed to the other variants that
sound more like they are providing generic financial advice.
Another goal of the test was understanding the customer’s ability
to respond to an overdraft notification. The model predicted a
customer’s risk but cannot predict if a customer has the means to
prevent an overdraft when they are notified. Typically, customers in
the low-mid range of risk opened notifications more often compared
to customers at high risk. As part of the test analysis customers were
divided into three groups: high ability to respond, positive balances
in accounts and few overdrafts; medium ability to respond, positive
balances and many overdrafts; low ability to respond, negative
balances in accounts and many overdraft. The high and medium
ability to respond groups generally always had a smaller percentage
of customers that overdrafted than the low ability to respond group
as well as higher email open rates. We find that the low ability to
respond group is not unaware they are overdrafting, rather they do
not have the means to prevent overdrawing their accounts making
this intervention ineffective for them. This raises the question of
whether chronic overdrafters should receive email notifications
even if we believe they cannot prevent the overdraft or will not
interact with the notification. Given that the model exists in a social
and ethical context, we believe that all customers should be warned
of an overdraft regardless of their ability to prevent overdrafts. If
certain customers receive email interventions and others do not, we
risk creating or exacerbating a disparity[ 15,24] by not providing
everyone at-risk the chance to prevent the overdraft.
Customer interviews during the test provided valuable insight
into how customers react to the warning. One major concern was
that false positives messages would lead to customers losing faith
in the system and ignore future messages as a result. In those in-
terviews, we were able to learn that customers were not inured
by false positives messages, email notifications that incorrectly
identified customers that are about to overdraft, as long as they
could intuitively understand why they received the notification
based on their transaction and balance data. Customers that re-
ceived messages and could not avoid an overdraft were also still
engaged and believed the notifications could be helpful when they
had the ability to respond in the future. Secondly, we found that no
customer actually handled an overdraft the moment they received
a notice and sometimes forgot until an overdraft fee was charged.
We plan on adding an immediate push notification and later email
reminder to be more effective in the future. A common request
across interviews was for the Mint app to handle an impending
overdraft automatically. In the future this could be done by auto-
mated or assisted movement of funds or requesting a waiver on the
customer’s behalf.7 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, the authors have presented a machine learning ap-
proach to develop a risk model for predicting which Mint customers
will overdraft their checking account within the next week and
provide an early warning email notification. Each bank’s model
provides lift over the prior and outperforms a business rule model
while also balancing stability and performance. Several message
variations were tested using nudge theory to find the most effective
messaging. Overall, the system has saved customers $3 million in
overdraft fees during a test of the model.
At a higher level, the methodology and approach can be used
to provide different types of financial advice. We have shown in
this paper we can help customers avoid unnecessary overdraft
fees. Although most ML-based work has focused on investing and
financial markets, we strongly believe that ML-based tools can
benefit personal finances. Specifically, we believe that we can pro-
vide ML-driven advice to help customers with other important
aspects of personal finance such as increasing credit scores, build-
ing emergency savings, paying down debt, and allocating capital for
investments. In the future, we hope to report on more ML-guided
tools in personal finance.

Figure 8: Overdraft Messages. Customers in the treatment
group were sent a variety of messages meant to nudge them
to change their behavior. This includes an empowering, base-
line, and loss aversion message. The message also included
the bank of the account we believed they were going to over-
draft as well as the last date a customer had received an
overdraft fee and a list of options for trying to avoid an over-
draft fee. The baseline message, "Overdraft Early Warning",
had the highest open-rate (30%) compared to the other two
messages. We speculate the simple message, "Overdraft Early
Warning", better prompted the customer that they were at
immediate risk of overdrawing their account compared to
the other two messages.
