ABSTRACT
In the era of information explosion, news recommender systems
are crucial for users to effectively and efficiently discover their
interested news. However, most of the existing news recommender
systems face two major issues, hampering recommendation quality.
Firstly, they often oversimplify users’ reading interests, neglecting
their hierarchical nature, spanning from high-level event (e.g., US
Election) related interests to low-level news article-specific inter-
ests. Secondly, existing work often assumes a simplistic context,
disregarding the prevalence of fake news and political bias under
the real-world context. This oversight leads to recommendations of
biased or fake news, posing risks to individuals and society. To this
end, this paper addresses these gaps by introducing a novel frame-
work, the Hierarchical and Disentangling Interest learning frame-
work (HDInt). HDInt incorporates a hierarchical interest learning
module and a disentangling interest learning module. The former
captures users’ high- and low-level interests, enhancing next-news
recommendation accuracy. The latter effectively separates polarity
and veracity information from news contents and model them more
specifically, promoting fairness- and truth-aware reading interest
learning for unbiased and true news recommendations. Extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate HDInt’s supe-
riority over state-of-the-art news recommender systems in deliver-
ing accurate, unbiased, and true news recommendations.

1 INTRODUCTION
News recommender systems (RSs) aim at helping users efficiently
discover news items aligned with their specific interests from a
vast array of candidates [ 14,30,31]. News RSs have assumed an
increasingly vital role in the contemporary era of big data and digi-
tal economy. Various news RSs have been widely applied on news
portals such as CNN, BBC, as well as social media platforms like
Facebook and TikTok [ 21]. In practical terms, news RSs can influ-
ence or even change users’ reading behaviors to a great extent [ 6].
A series of studies on news RSs have been documented in the
literature, spanning from conventional machine learning-based
methods to advanced deep learning-based approaches. For instance,
Capelle et al. [ 3] introduced a method that represents news using
Synset Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency for news recom-
mendations. More recently, deep learning models have been em-
ployed to enhance the understanding of news content for more
accurate recommendations. For example, Wu et al. [ 38] used self-
attention and additive attention to represent words in each news
item and news sequences, respectively, for news recommendations.
Wang et al. [ 27] utilized dilated convolutions to capture fine-grained
reading interest matching degrees. Mao et al. [ 16] utilized graph
attention networks to improve user and news representations by
incorporating additional semantic information.
Although great advancements have been achieved, most of ex-
isting news RSs face two major gaps, significantly hampering the
recommendation quality. Gap 1: they often oversimplify users’ read-
ing interests into a single level, neglecting the hierarchical nature
(i.e., high- and low-level) of them, leading to limited recommendation
accuracy. In practice, a user’s reading interests towards news often
span from high-level interests in events (e.g., Russia-Ukraine con-
flict) to low-level interests in specific news articles. Furthermore,
these interests often change along with time and low-level interests
usually change faster compared with high-level ones, and thus such
two levels of interests cannot be well modelled in a single level. For
instance, a user Alice has kept reading a sequence of different news
articles for the event “Russia-Ukraine conflict” for several months
and then changed to reading news articles for another relevant
event “Nord Stream pipeline bombed”. In this case, Alice’s change
on news articles is much faster than that on news events since each
3200

event often has a series of news articles of various styles associated
with it. Gap 2: more importantly, existing news RSs often assume a
simplistic context, disregarding the prevalence of political bias (i.e.,
left-leaning or right-leaning) and fake news under the real-world
context [2]. This oversight easily leads to biased and/or fake news
recommendations, posing risks to individuals and society [ 33,35].
In the real world, it is not uncommon that there may exist politically
biased news and fake news in the cyber space, bringing significantly
extra challenges for news recommendations.
These challenges cannot be well addressed by existing news RSs
even some of them have taken news bias or veracity into account.
On the one hand, existing fairness-aware news RSs mainly focus
on sentiment bias on news side [ 39], exposure bias on provider
side [ 20], or attribute (e.g., gender) bias on user side [ 40]. However,
the commonly existing political polarity bias on news side is less
studied though it often generates significant impact on the public
opinion. More importantly, they often sacrifice recommendation
accuracy and overlook the existence of fake news. On the other
hand, those very limited studies [ 33] which take news veracity
into account tend to overlook other important aspects like fair-
ness and accuracy of recommendations. All in all, there lacks of a
unified framework to comprehensively address all the aforemen-
tioned three important aspects for generating high-quality news
recommendations: accuracy, news bias and veracity.
To this end, we aim at bridging those aforementioned two signifi-
cant gaps in the literature. Specifically, we focus on the concrete task
of how to make accurate, unbiased and true news recommendations
toward a healthy news reading environment under the complex
context where biased news and fake news commonly exist.
Accordingly, we propose a novel unified Hierarchical and Disen-
tangling Interest learning framework (HDInt) for accurate, unbiased
and true news recommendations. HDInt is composed of two core
modules: (1) a hierarchical interest learning module for bridging the
first gap, and (2) a disentangling interest learning module for bridg-
ing the second gap. In particular, the first module is equipped with
two relatively independent dynamic interest learning components
to well learn each user’s high-level and low-level reading interests
respectively from their historical news articles, leading to accurate
recommendations. The second module is equipped with two disen-
tanglers which successively disentangle the political polarity bias
and veracity information from news contents and model them in a
relatively independent way. In this way, the reading interest learned
from users’ reading history are more politically unbiased and true
news-oriented, contributing to recommending unbiased and true
news. Furthermore, the disentangled veracity information will be
input into a veracity classifier to accurately predict the veracity
label (i.e., true or fake) of each candidate news item so that only
those predicted true news will be recommended to end users.
Main contributions of this work are summarized below:
•We propose a novel, practical and emerging research problem,
namely how to make accurate, unbiased, and true news rec-
ommendations with a unified framework under the real-world
complex context where biased and fake news commonly exist?
•We propose a novel and unified HDInt framework as one of the
early solutions to this challenging problem. HDInt is more robust
to the real-world complex context than existing news RSs.•In HDInt, a novel hierarchical interest learning module is devised
to accurately learn each user’s high-level and low-level reading
interests respectively, together with another novel disentangling
interest learning module to effectively learn each user’s unbiased
and true news-oriented reading interests.
We instantiate this framework into a specific model. Extensive
experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the
consistent and significant superiority of our model over the repre-
sentative and state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommending
accurate, unbiased and true news to users.
2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Accuracy-oriented News Recommendation
News RSs generally recommend the next piece of news to users via
learning users’ reading interest towards news from their reading
history, i.e., a sequence of news items. During the past decades, a va-
riety of methods have been proposed to continually improve news
recommendation accuracy. For instance, Capelle et al. [ 3] intro-
duced a method which utilises Synset Frequency-Inverse Document
Frequency to represent news contents for news recommendations.
In recent years, deep neural networks have been widely employed
to improve the accuracy of news recommendations. Various deep
neural models from recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [ 1,17], at-
tention mechanism [ 37,47], dilated convolution [ 27], graph neural
networks [ 8], knowledge distillation [ 28], to deep reinforcement
learning [ 46] are explored for news recommendations. For example,
Wu et al. [ 38] introduced self-attention and additive attention mod-
els to represent words within each news article and a sequence of
historical news for news recommendations. Wang et al. [ 27] utilised
dilated convolution model to capture fine-grained interest match-
ing signals for news recommendations. Ma et al. [ 15] proposed
an unsupervised pre-training paradigm to effectively model user
behaviors for accurate new recommendations. Although great suc-
cess has been achieved, all of these methods are accuracy-oriented
only. They overlook other important aspects, such as bias and fake
information, which commonly exist in the real-world context.
2.2 Unbiased and True News Recommendation
Recently, researchers have realized the negative effect of bias in
news recommendations, and thus developed various news RSs for
unbiased recommendations [ 12]. They can be generally categorized
into different classes according to the type of bias (e.g., user side bias,
item side bias, provider side bias). For instance, Wu et al. [ 40] pro-
posed a decomposed adversarial learning approach to alleviate the
biases of sensitive user attributes for fair news recommendations.
Wu et al. [ 39] proposed a sentiment diversity-aware news RS to
remove the sentiment bias embedded in news contents. Qi et al. [ 20]
proposed an orthogonal regularization to better learn provider-fair
representations in news representations. However, all those stud-
ies did not touch the commonly exiting political bias. Only quite
limited studies explored political effect in news recommendations.
They either proposed an attention-based neural network model to
reduce political homogenization in content-based news recommen-
dations [ 23], or modelled the interaction between political typology
and filter bubbles to diversify recommended news contents [ 13].
However, these studies are just to diversify the political polarities

or news contents, totally different from the political bias we focused
on in this work. Moreover, they overlooked the veracity informa-
tion and may unavoidably recommend fake news to end users. Very
few researchers take news veracity into account [ 26,33]. However,
they are just in the early stage and more importantly, they overlook
the commonly existing bias issue.
3 PROBLEM FORMULATION
A user-news interaction dataset records each user’s sequence of
historical interactions (e.g., clicks or reading) with news in a certain
time period. Specifically, D={S1,···,S𝑢,···,S|U|}denotes a
collection of news sequences interacted by all users (indexed by
𝑢∈U ), whereS𝑢={𝑣1,···,𝑣𝑡}(𝑣∈V) consists of𝑡pieces of
news sequentially interacted by a user 𝑢. Each news is indexed by
its interaction timestamp where V=V𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡∪V𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑙∪V𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 or
V=V𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒∪V𝑓𝑎𝑘𝑒.Vdenotes the whole news set with polarity
and veracity labels. In addition, a news information table Nrecords
the meta information (i.e., news title) of each news piece. For each
user𝑢, given their(𝑡−1)historical true and/or fake news pieces with
polarity labels, denoted as context 𝐶𝑢={𝑣1,···,𝑣𝑡−1}together
with the meta information, we build a recommendation framework
F(i.e., HDInt) with two-fold goals: (1) learning users’ high- and
low-level interests from 𝐶𝑢for accurate recommendations, and (2)
disentangling the polarity bias and veracity information from news
contents for unbiased and true news recommendations.
4 THE HDINT FRAMEWORK
As shown in Figure 1 (a), the HDInt framework contains three main
components: (1) hierarchical interest learning module, (2) disentan-
gling interest learning module, and (3) next-news prediction. First,
given a context consisting of a sequence of (𝑡−1)news pieces
interacted by a user where each news piece is associated with news
contents and keywords, we map the contents and keywords of each
news item into a latent embedding vector respectively. Afterwards,
disentangling interest learning module takes the content embed-
ding as input and successively disentangles the potential political
polarity information and veracity information with a polarity dis-
entangler and a veracity disentangler respectively. Subsequently,
the resultant polarity- and veracity-free content embedding will
be input into the low-level interest learner within the hierarchical
interest learning module to learn user’s low-level interest towards
specific news articles. At the same time, the keyword embedding
is input into the high-level interest learner to learn high-level in-
terest towards certain news events. Finally, both levels of interests
are aggregated for predicting the next piece of news. In addition,
prediction module takes each candidate news’ veracity embedding
as the input to predict its veracity label to filter out those predicted
fake news. Although each module has been instantiated to a specific
model structure, they can be easily instantiated to other structures
in the future. Hence, our proposed HDInt is a general framework
with great potential for expansion and further optimization.
4.1 Disentangling Interest Learning Module
As illustrated in Figure 1 (b), the disentangling interest learning
module comprises two serially connected disentanglers to disen-
tangle the polarity information including political bias and veracityinformation from news contents and model them in a relatively
independent manner. Both disentanglers are built on an adversarial
auto-encoder framework [ 5,33,44], which encompasses an encoder,
two decoders, and a specifically designed loss function module. Here,
we delve into the specifics of the polarity disentangler, while the
veracity disentangler has a similar structure.
4.1.1 Encoder. The encoder consists of a three-layer network struc-
ture that takes the news content embedding as input. For a news 𝑣𝑗,
we learn a content embedding c𝑗based on its title and description:
c𝑗=𝐹𝐶(c𝑚
𝑗), (1)
where𝐹𝐶indicates a fully connection layer with a sigmoid acti-
vation function. c𝑚
𝑗is a concatenation of both news title embed-
ding and news description embedding. Following the established
conventions in text embedding [ 9,43], both types of embeddings
are initially generated using a widely adopted pre-trained BERT
model [ 10]. Then, we undergo fine-tuning to align with the specifics
of our task. We empirically set the dimension of c𝑗to 256, employing
a grid search method. The dimensions of the title embedding and
description embedding remain at the default 768 within the BERT
model. Once content embedding c𝑗is ready, it is inputted into the
encoder to derive the hidden state h𝑝
𝑗in the polarity disentangler:
z1
𝑗=𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑘𝑦𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈(𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒(c𝑗)), (2)
z2
𝑗=𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑘𝑦𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈(𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒([c𝑗;z1
𝑗])), (3)
h𝑝
𝑗=𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑘𝑦𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈(𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒([c𝑗;z2
𝑗])), (4)
where the parameter 𝛼is empirically configured to 0.1 in the
LeakyReLU activation function and 𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒 indicates a fully connec-
tion network. Besides, we employ residual connections to enhance
the efficiency of feature extraction.
Upon obtaining the hidden state h𝑝
𝑗for news𝑣𝑗, this state serves
as the input for both the polarity-free decoder and polarity decoder.
From the standpoint of representation learning, h𝑝
𝑗can be viewed
as the high-level abstract representation of the content of news 𝑣𝑗.
4.1.2 Polarity-free Decoder. A polarity-free decoder extracts the
polarity-free information from the news content hidden represen-
tation h𝑝
𝑗. Similar to encoder, the structure of this decoder is also a
three-layer network with residual connections. Specifically,
d1
𝑗=𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑘𝑦𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈(𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒(h𝑝
𝑗)), (5)
d2
𝑗=𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑘𝑦𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈(𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒([d1
𝑗;h𝑝
𝑗])), (6)
f𝑗=𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑘𝑦𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈(𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒([d2
𝑗;h𝑝
𝑗])), (7)
where the parameter 𝛼in LeakyReLU is empirically set to 0.1. The
output f𝑗of polarity-free decoder is the latent representation of
content(s) without polarity information for news 𝑣𝑗.
4.1.3 Polarity Decoder. The polarity decoder comprises a decoder
with an identical structure to that of the polarity-free decoder,
alongside a news polarity classifier . This classifier is designed to
predict the polarity label of the news article 𝑣𝑗by utilizing the
output of the decoder as input. During the training phase, we mini-
mize the discrepancy between the predicted polarity label and the
ground-truth label in the training set. This process encourages the
polarity decoder to extract polarity-specific information effectively.

Figure 1: (a) HDInt framework is bulit on three main components: hierarchical interest learning module, disentangling interest
learning module and next-news prediction, (b) The disentangling interest learning module is equipped with two serially
connected disentanlgers: polarity disentangler and veracity disentangler.
Specifically, with the news hidden representation h𝑝
𝑗as input, the
decoder performs operations akin to those outlined in Eqs. (5) to (7)
to generate the polarity representation p𝑗for news𝑣𝑗. Then, the
classifier takes p𝑗as the input to predict the polarity label ˆ𝑦𝑝
𝑗,
ˆ𝑦𝑝
𝑗=𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒(p𝑗)), (8)
where we employ the softmax function here, which is a widely
accepted choice for classification task. However, exploring more
powerful classifiers remains a potential avenue for future research.
4.1.4 Loss Function Module. In order to effectively train the polar-
ity disentangler, we have devised three specific loss functions for
its optimization: reconstruction loss, label prediction loss, adversarial
loss. Throughout the training phase, these losses collectively con-
tribute to the overall loss. The reconstruction loss is a fundamental
component inherent to any auto-encoder structure. Here, we con-
catenate the disentangled polarity-free content representation f𝑗
and the polarity representation p𝑗to facilitate the reconstruction of
the initial news content embedding c𝑗. This ensures no information
loss during the disentanglement process. Formally,
𝐿𝑝
𝑟=1
2 [f𝑗;p𝑗]−c𝑗2. (9)
The polarity label prediction loss aims at ensuring that the disen-
tangled polarity representation p𝑗accurately reflects the polarity
information (left-leaning, neutral or right-leaning) of the news
content. In this context, we employ the widely accepted binary
cross-entropy loss [ 45] to quantify this loss for each news item 𝑣𝑗:
𝐿𝑝
𝑙=−𝑦𝑝
𝑗log(ˆ𝑦𝑝
𝑗), (10)
𝑦𝑝
𝑗and ˆ𝑦𝑝
𝑗are the true polarity label and predicted one respectively.The adversarial loss plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the
disentangled polarity-free content representation remains devoid
of any polarity-related information. To attain this goal, we utilize
the disentangled polarity-free content representation f𝑗of news𝑣𝑗
to predict the polarity label ˜𝑦𝑝
𝑗and subsequently aim to maximize
the prediction error (or minimize the reciprocal of the error),
𝐿𝑝
𝑎=−1
𝑦𝑝
𝑗log(˜𝑦𝑝
𝑗), (11)
where ˜𝑦𝑝
𝑗=𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒(f𝑗)).
Finally, the overall loss of the polarity disentangler is the sum of
all the aforementioned three losses:
𝐿𝑝=𝐿𝑝
𝑟+𝐿𝑝
𝑙+𝐿𝑝
𝑎. (12)
In a similar vein, by adhering to the framework illustrated in Figure
1(b), the overall loss of the veracity disentangler can be calculated:
𝐿𝑣𝑒=𝐿𝑣𝑒
𝑟+𝐿𝑣𝑒
𝑙+𝐿𝑣𝑒
𝑎. (13)
4.2 Hierarchical Interest Learning Module
The hierarchical interest learning module consists of two compo-
nents: (1) the high- and low-level interest learners for assimilating the
user’s reading interests. One takes news keyword embedding as in-
put to learn high-level interests towards certain news events/topics,
while the other takes polarity- and veracity-free content embedding
for learning unbiased and true news-oriented low level interests to-
wards news articles for certain events/topics; and (2) the a high- and
low-level interest aggregation module to effectively aggregate both
levels of interests while well modeling the intricate relationships
between the context news and the candidate news.
3203A Hierarchical and Disentangling Interest Learning Framework for Unbiased and True News Recommendation KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
4.2.1 High-level & Low-level Interest Learner. Given a piece of news
𝑣𝑗, its three keywords are extracted and their embeddings k1
𝑗,k2
𝑗,k3
𝑗
are pre-trained using BERT aforementioned in 4.1.1. Then, we input
the concatenation of them into a fully connected layer:
k𝑗=𝐹𝐶([k1
𝑗;k2
𝑗;k3
𝑗]), (14)
where k𝑗is a column vector. Once k𝑗is ready, the keyword embed-
ding matrix K=[k1,k2,...,k𝑡−1]of the context can be fed into the
high-level interest learner, specified as a one-layer transformer:
˜K=𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑟(K), (15)
where ˜K∈Rdim(˜k𝑗)×(𝑡−1). Similarly, all the polarity- and veracity-
free content embeddings, denoted as E=[e1,e2,..., e𝑡−1], where
𝑑𝑖𝑚(e𝑗)=𝑑𝑖𝑚(k𝑗), can be seamlessly integrated into the low-level
interest learner, which is also specified as a one-layer transformer:
˜E=𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑟(E), (16)
where ˜E∈Rdim(˜e𝑗)×(𝑡−1)and these two transformers share an
identical structure.
4.2.2 High-level & Low-level Interest Aggregation. In order to gen-
erate a unified and informative interest embedding for next news
prediction, we aggregate interests learned from each interest learner
with the guidance of candidate news information. Concretely, we
utilize the keyword representation k𝑡and disentangled polarity-
and veracity-free content representation e𝑡of each candidate news
𝑣𝑡as aggregation cues. Accordingly, a specialized attention mecha-
nism is devised to selectively extract relevant information at each
level to form the high- and low-level interest representations iℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
andi𝑙𝑜𝑤respectively:
iℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ=𝑡−1∑︁
𝑘=1𝛼𝑘˜k𝑘,i𝑙𝑜𝑤=𝑡−1∑︁
𝑘=1𝛽𝑘˜e𝑘, (17)
𝛼𝑘=𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(kT
𝑡W1˜k𝑘),𝛽𝑘=𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(eT
𝑡W2˜e𝑘),(18)
where W1andW2are trainable parameters.
4.3 Next-news Prediction Module
In addition to the news context 𝐶, user ID information is also incor-
porated as an input to enhance the personalization of recommen-
dations. Therefore, we combine the high- and low-level interests
learned from context news and user ID together to build an infor-
mative user embedding with a dense layer:
u=𝐹𝐶([iℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ;i𝑙𝑜𝑤;u𝑖𝑑]). (19)
Once uis prepared, it is fed into the next-news prediction module
to forecast the next news item for user 𝑢. First, the polarity- and
veracity-free representation e𝑡and the veracity representation l𝑡
are disentangled for each candidate news article 𝑣𝑡, a task han-
dled by the disentangling interest learning module. Subsequently,
a standard inner product operation is executed between uande𝑡
to compute a score that quantifies the relevance between the given
context𝐶𝑢and𝑣𝑡. Finally, a sigmoid function is employed to trans-
form the computed score into a probability value, which signifies
the likelihood that the news article 𝑣𝑡will be appreciated by 𝑢:
𝑝𝑡=𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑑(uT·e𝑡). (20)
Simultaneously, aiming at recommending true news only to users,
the veracity label ˆ𝑦𝑣𝑒
𝑡for each candidate news 𝑣𝑡is predicted via
the veracity classifier with l𝑡as the input. As a result, from the pre-
dicted true candidate news, the top- 𝐾news items with the highest
probabilities are selected as the recommendation list.4.4 Model Optimization and Training
4.4.1 The Loss Function. As we are jointly optimizing multiple
tasks, the total loss 𝐿comprises three components: (1) the loss
arising from the next-item prediction task, denoted as 𝐿𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡, (2) the
disentangling losses incurred during the processing of context news,
specifically 𝐿𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑝and𝐿𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒, (3) the disentangling losses incurred
during the processing of candidate news, namely 𝐿𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑝and𝐿𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑣𝑒.

where𝜆and𝛾are hyper-parameters.
The calculation of the loss terms 𝐿𝑐𝑜𝑛and𝐿𝑐𝑎𝑛has been detailed
in Section 4.1.4. Therefore, we only focus on explaining how to
compute𝐿𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡. For the task of next-item prediction, we employ
the commonly used cross-entropy loss. Specifically, given a news
context𝐶, we create a contrastive pair ⟨𝑠+,𝑆−⟩. Here,𝑠+represents
the ground truth next news item, denoted as 𝑣𝑠, serving as the
positive sample. Additionally, we randomly select 𝑛news articles
from the news setV\𝑣𝑠to form the negative sample set 𝑆−. The
loss associated with the positive sample and each negative sam-
ple is computed as follows: −log(𝑝+𝑠)for the positive sample and
−log(1−𝑝𝑠−)for each negative sample, where 𝑝+𝑠represents the
predicted probability (as defined in Eq ( 20)). Consequently, the loss
for one contrastive pair is calculated as:
𝐿𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡=−[log(𝑝𝑠+)+∑︁
𝑠−∈𝑆−log(1−𝑝𝑠−)]. (22)
4.4.2 Model Training. Our model is implemented using Tensor-
Flow 1.14 within a Python 3.6 environment. Model parameters are
learned through the minimization of the total loss denoted as 𝐿,
employing a mini-batch learning procedure. We utilize the Adam
optimizer [ 11] for gradient-based learning. The initial learning rate
is determined through a grid search, exploring values within the
range [0.0006, 0.0014] with a step size of 0.0002, and it is empirically
set to 0.0001. The batch size is also empirically set to 64, and the
number of negative samples for training is configured to 4. All
model parameters are fine-tuned using the validation set. Our ex-
periments are conducted on a cluster, where each node is equipped
with a 32-core CPU running at 2.0GHz and 128GB of RAM.
5 EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATIONS
5.1 Data Preparation
In our particular setting, we need user-news interaction data, as
well as news political polarity and veracity information for accu-
rate, unbiased and true news recommendations. To the best of our
knowledge, there is not such an existing public dataset. Existing
public datasets for news recommendations do not contain news
veracity information while datasets for fake news detection usu-
ally lack comprehensive information regarding reading histories
of individual users. Fortunately, we found user-news interactions
and news veracity information can be extracted from a commonly
used dataset FakeNewsNet1[24]. In addition, we retrieved the po-
litical polarity of each news item according to its source from a
commonly used media bias/fact check website2. Therefore, we built

our dataset based on such information. FakeNewsNet dataset com-
prises two extensive datasets, namely PolitiFact and GossipCop. In
each dataset, for each user, we built their reading sequence Sby
arranging all news items (may contain true or/and fake news) con-
sumed by them in chronological order according to their respective
reading timestamps. The aggregation of all such sequences consti-
tutes the user-news interaction dataset D. Concurrently, for each
news item, we extracted its content information, comprising the
title and a concise one-paragraph description, keywords, together
with news political polarity and veracity information.
Once users’ reading sequences are built, we construct sequence
instances for training and testing using each user 𝑢’s news se-
quenceS. Each instance is a context-target news pair ⟨C,𝑣𝑡⟩, where
C={𝑣1,···,𝑣𝑡−1}is the reading history as the input, and 𝑣𝑡is the
target news item to be predicted. For better personalising, the user
ID is also taken as part of the input. To counteract recommend-
ing fake news, we retain only those instances with a ground-truth
true target news piece in experiments. We apply the commonly
adopted sliding window technique [ 25] and padding and masking
techniques [ 4] to process those sequences longer or shorter than
the fixed length 𝑡respectively. In line with typical practices [ 32],
we maintain a fixed value of 𝑡=5in our work. Subsequently, we
create three distinct test sets by randomly selecting 10%, 20% and
30% of the constructed instances. Similarly, we allocate 10% as the
corresponding validation set, the remainder for the training set.
For each split ratio, we conduct 10-fold cross-validation and report
the average results. Notably, our method consistently outperforms
all baseline approaches across all three splits. Due to space con-
straints, we present results exclusively for the 10% split. Detailed
characteristics of the experimental datasets are provided in Table 1.
5.2 Experiment Settings
5.2.1 Baseline Methods. Our task is to recommend the next news
article, similar to sequential recommendations [ 22]. In addition,
we aim at reducing bias and fake news. To this end, we select
two classes of methods as baselines: (1) representative and state-
of-the-art sequential RSs [ 34], encompassing both general (item)
sequential RSs and those tailored for next news recommendations;
and (2) representative and state-of-the-art RSs for unbiased news
recommendations or for mitigating fake news. In total, the selected
11 baseline methods are grounded in various modeling paradigms,
including nearest neighbor models, graph neural networks (GNNs),
recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), and attention models, etc. The details are as follows:•SKNN: a sequence and time aware neighborhood model for next-
item recommendation [7].
•SR-GNN: a representative GNN based model for next-item rec-
ommendation [41].
•NRMS: a multi-head self-attention based model for news recom-
mendation according to each user’s reading history [38].
•LSTUR: an RNN and attention based model for next-news recom-
mendation. It learns users’ long and short term preferences [1].
•FedRec: a decentralized next-news recommendation model based
on RNN, CNN and attention mechanism [19].
•FIM: a 3D CNN-based next-news recommendation model which
preforms fine-grained interest matching [27].
•ESM: a news RS that effectively combines event matching and
style matching for accurate news recommendations [18].
•Glory: an advanced news recommender which combines global
representations learned from other users with local representa-
tions to enhance personalized news recommendations [42].
•Rec4Mit: a personalized news recommendation model that takes
into account news veracity to mitigate the spread of fake news [ 33].
•SentiRec: a sentiment diversity-aware neural news RS, which
can recommend news with more diverse sentiment [39].
•ProFairRec: a news RS focusing on provider fairness to improve
the fairness and diversity of recommendations [20].
5.2.2 Evaluation Metrics. In light of our approach’s objective of
recommending accurate, unbiased and true news to end users, we
assess the performance of all the approaches from three distinct an-
gles: (1) recommendation accuracy, gauging the ability to precisely
recommend news articles that align with a user’s reading interests;
(2) recommendation fairness, evaluating the approach’s capacity to
mitigate political bias within the recommended news list; and (3)
the ratio of true news included in the recommendation list, indicat-
ing the approach’s effectiveness in avoiding recommending fake
news. In accordance with established conventions [ 1], we employ
two widely recognized ranking-based metrics: recall (REC) and
normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) [ 36] for measuring
recommendation accuracy, commonly used for assessing next-news
recommendation performance [ 19,27]. They are computed based
on the top𝐾ranked news, denoted as REC@ 𝐾and NDCG@ 𝐾,
respectively. Concerning recommendation fairness, we introduce
polarity proportion error (PE@ 𝐾) and fairness score (FS@ 𝐾):
𝑃𝐸@𝐾=1−|#𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑠
𝐾−#𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑠
𝐾|, (23)
𝐹𝑆@𝐾=−1×(#𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑠)+1×(#𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑠)
𝐾, (24)
where−1,0and1indicate the polarity label left-leaning, neutral
and right-leaning respectively. Hence, the more approaching 0 the
FS, the more unbiased the recommendation list.
Drawing inspiration from the conventional F1-score, we design
a new metric, i.e., a redefined F1-score@ 𝐾(F1@𝐾), to aggregate
NDCG@𝐾and PE@𝐾into a unified metric:
𝐹1@𝐾=2×𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺 @𝐾×𝑃𝐸@𝐾
𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺 @𝐾+𝑃𝐸@𝐾, (25)
Moreover, we introduce another metric, the ratio of true news (de-
noted as RT@ 𝐾) [33] for each recommendation list, for evaluating
the capability of recommending true news:
𝑅𝑇@𝐾=#𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑠
𝐾. (26)

1The improvement is over the best-performing baseline methods whose performance is underlined. For FS@K, negative and positive values indicate left biased and right biased
respectively, and the smaller its absolute value, the more fair the recommendations.
For all these four metrics, we report them at 𝐾=5and𝐾=20
respectively in our experiments. Following [ 29], a paired t-test with
p<0.05 is used for significance test.
5.2.3 Parameter Settings. To be fair, we meticulously tune all model
parameters, including hyper-parameters, for both baseline methods
and our proposed approach on a validation dataset. Specifically, for
each baseline method, we initialize parameters using values from
the original paper and fine-tune them on our datasets to optimize
performance. The embedding dimensions for user ID and news
ID are set to 32 and 128, respectively, using a grid search with
increments of 4 and 16, respectively, across all methods. Further
details about crucial parameters for each baseline will be provided
in Section 5.3 during the experimental result analysis. In our model,
we empirically assign a weight of 1.3 and 10 to the prediction loss
for the next news ( 𝜆) on the PolitiFact and GossipCop dataset,
respectively, based on validation set performance. The polarity loss
weight (𝛾) is set to 3 for both datasets. Empirically, we use 4 heads
in the one-layer transformer architecture for both datasets. We
conduct training for 15 epochs on both datasets and use 4 negative
samples (comprising 2 true news pieces and 2 fake news pieces)
during training.
5.3 Performance Comparison with Baselines
5.3.1 Comparisons w.r.t. Recommendation Accuracy and Fairness.
In order to achieve the best performance, we carefully tune param-
eters for each baseline on the validation set. For SKNN, we set the
number of neighborhoods to 500. In SR-GNN, we adjust the decay
ratio of the learning rate to 0.1 and introduce an L2 penalty of 10−5.
NRMS and FedNewsRec both feature 14 heads for self-attention,
while LSTUR utilizes 300 filters in the CNN with a filter window
size of 3. ESM employs 4 GCN layers and 10 clusters. In Glory, the
number of most recently clicked news article of a user is set to 50,
the maximum title length is set to 30 and the number of maximum
used entities of each news item is set to 5. In Rec4Mit, the number
of latent events is set to 10 and 20 on Political and Gossip dataset
Figure 2: The ratio of true news (RT) in recommendation
lists.
respectively. SentiRec adjusts two weights within the total loss
function, setting them to 0.5 and 15. In ProFairRec, the provider
encoder is considered as the polarity encoder, and the weight for
the adversarial loss is set to 0.04.
The comparison results on accuracy and fairness metrics are pre-
sented in Table 2. It is evident that representative next-item recom-
mendation approaches, such as SKNN and SR-GNN, exhibit lower
accuracy compared to prominent sequential news recommendation
methods like NRMS, LSTUR, ESM and Glory. This emphasizes the
superiority of sequential news RSs in effectively handling news data,
characterized by distinctive features like news meta-information
(e.g., title and description) and the real-time nature of news events.
In the context of unbiased news recommendation, SentiRec and
ProFairRec stand out as two of the few approaches that strike a bet-
ter balance between accuracy and fairness, as indicated by F1@ 𝐾
when compared with other accuracy-focused baselines. In contrast,
our HDInt not only captures users’ high- and low-level reading
interests but also disentangles political polarity information from
news contents and thus mitigates political bias. This comprehen-
sive approach results in superior performance w.r.t. both accuracy
and fairness. HDInt generally outperforms the best-performing
baseline(s) by an average of 2.23% across accuracy metrics, with
improvements up to 8.83%, and an average of 7.94% across fairness
3206KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Shoujin Wang et al.
metrics, with improvements up to 30.03% (cf. the last column in
Table 2).
5.3.2 Comparisons w.r.t. the Ratio of True News. In Figure 2, we
illustrate the ratio of true news (Eq. (26)) within the recommenda-
tion lists generated by all compared approaches. Our HDInt model
consistently outperforms all baseline methods regarding RT@5 and
RT@20 on both datasets. This superiority can be attributed to the
fact that most of the baseline approaches ignore the existence of
fake news, and thus generate recommendations based on interest
matching only, leading to recommendations of both true and fake
news. Notably, Rec4Mit demonstrates the second-best performance
w.r.t. RT, achieving an impressive RT@5 (resp. RT@20) of 99.85%
(resp. 99.76%) on PolitiFact, and 99.59% (resp. 98.31%) on GossipCop
respectively. This is attributed to its specific design for recommend-
ing true news. In contrast, our HDInt approach incorporates a
disentangling interest learning module, which not only mitigates
political polarity bias but also classifies each candidate news piece
into true or fake ones. Consequently, HDInt can recommend true
news to users only. Thanks to the high accuracy of the classifier,
it achieves an RT@5 and RT@20 of 100% on PolitiFact and 99.72%
and 98.59% on GossipCop, respectively.
5.4 Ablation Study
5.4.1 Settings. To analyze the rationality and the effectiveness of
the designed components in our HDInt framework, we conduct
an ablation study to compare HDInt with its three variants: (1)
HDInt-KW: which ignores the high-level interest by removing
the high-level interest learner; (2) HDInt-P: which removes the
polarity disentangler by directly taking the initial news content
embedding c𝑗as the input of the veracity disentangler; (3) HDInt-
V: which removes the veracity disentangler by directly replacing
its output e𝑗with the output of polarity disentangler f𝑗.

following findings: (1) The high-level interest learner benefit the
next-news recommendations. We note a notable numerical decline
in NDCG@𝐾when removing high-level interest learner. This phe-
nomenon underscores the critical role of high-level interests; (2) The
polarity disentangler can boost the recommendation fairness. Com-
paring the values in the fifth column in Table 3, we observe that in
the absence of a polarity disentangler, the fairness metrics PE@ 𝐾
and FS@𝐾experience a sharp decline; (3) The veracity disentangler
not only greatly reduces the recommendations of fake news, but also
improves recommendation accuracy. It is evident that the absence of
the veracity disentangler leads to a significant numerical decline in
RT@𝐾as well as REC@ 𝐾and NDCG@ 𝐾.
5.5 Parameter Test
We assess the sensitivity of HDInt on three critical parameters: the
weight assigned to predicting the next news loss, i.e., 𝜆, the weight
attributed to polarity loss, i.e., 𝛾(cf. Section 4.4.1), and the number
of heads in transformers (cf. Section 4.2.1).
5.5.1 Performance w.r.t. the weight of loss for predicting next news
(𝜆).We systematically vary the values of 𝜆across two datasets. For
the PolitiFact (resp. GossipCop) dataset, we range 𝜆from 1.1 (resp.
6) to 1.9 (resp. 14) with an increment step of 0.2 (resp. 2). The results
presented in Figure 3 show the optimal performance is attained
when𝜆is set to 1.3 and 10 for PolitiFact and GossipCop, respectively.
A smaller value fails to provide accurate recommendations, while
larger values compromise recommendation fairness.
5.5.2 Performance w.r.t. the weight of polarity loss ( 𝛾).We vary
the values of 𝛾on both datasets, ranging from 1 to 9 with a step
size of 2. Figure 4 presents the results. Our findings indicate that
an optimal value of 3, employed on both datasets, yields the best
performance. This weight strikes a balance by providing an infor-
mative representation for each piece of news. A smaller value fails
to capture the rich information from both news occurrence patterns
and meta information. Conversely, a larger weight over emphasizes
the fairness and thus reduces recommendation accuracy.
5.5.3 Performance w.r.t. the number of heads in transformers within
interest learners. We systematically varied the number of heads
in both transformers across both the PolitiFact and GossipCop
datasets, ranging from 2 to 32 with a step size of 2𝑛. The results
for both datasets are depicted in Figure 5. Our findings indicate
that an optimal value, specifically 4 for both datasets, delivers the
best performance by providing informative representations for
keywords and news contents. Smaller values for the number of
heads fall short in capturing the rich information encompassed by
both news keywords and news contents. Conversely, larger values
introduce unnecessary model parameters, ultimately impairing
performance.
5.6 Computation Efficiency Analysis
5.6.1 Complexity Analysis . The computational load of our pro-
posed HDInt model primarily stems from two components: (1) the
Disentangling Interest Learning Module, and (2) the Hierarchical In-
terest Learning Module. On one hand, within the Disentangling In-
terest Learning Module, the computational resources are consumed

by two encoder-decoder architectures (consisting of 2 encoders and
4 decoders, each composed of three layers of fully connected neural
networks with neuron counts ℎ1,ℎ2, andℎ3respectively) and 4
classifiers. The time complexity of encoder-decoder architectures is
𝑂(6·(𝑑·ℎ1+ℎ1·ℎ2))and that of classifiers is 𝑂(2·(2𝑑)+2·(3𝑑)),
where𝑑is the input dimension. On the other hand, in the Hierar-
chical Interest Learning Module, the computational cost primarily
arises from 2 Interest Learners (each implemented with a trans-
former layer) and 2 Interest Aggregation operations, with time
complexities of 𝑂(2·(𝑇2+2𝑇𝑑))and𝑂(2𝑑2), respectively, where
𝑇is the length of news sequence read by users. In summary, for
each user, the overall model’s time complexity approximates cubic
complexity.5.6.2 Inference Time Comparison. We compare the average infer-
ence time per user of HDInt with three representative and state-
of-the-art baseline methods on the two experiment datasets. Our
experiments are ran on a cluster node with an 8-core CPU running
at 3.70GHz and 64GB of RAM. As shown in Table 4, the average
inference time of HDInt is shorter on test sets of both datasets than
ProFairRec but slightly longer than that of ESM and Rec4Mit. This
result is acceptable, considering that HDInt can recommend accu-
rate, true and fair news to users, whereas the other three methods
can achieve at most two of these goals (cf. Section 5.3).

5.7 Case Study
To illustrate the practical impact of HDInt, on recommending unbi-
ased and true news, we conducted a case study on the GossipCop
dataset, which is presented in Section A in the appendix.
6 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we focused on a novel and significant research prob-
lem: how to effectively recommend accurate, unbiased and true
news in the real-world complex context? To address this problem,
we have proposed a novel hierarchical and disentangling interest
learning framework (HDInt). Owning to the special design, HDInt
is able to not only learn users’ high-level and low-level interests
towards news events and news articles respectively for improv-
ing recommendation accuracy, but also learn unbiased and true
news oriented reading interests to reduce political bias and fake
news in recommendation lists. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrated the superiority of HDInt over the state-of-
the-art news recommendation methods and verified the rationality
and effectiveness of its specific design. Future work includes the
exploration of more effective methods to disentangle political bias
and news veracity information from news contents for further
enhancing the fairness and truth of recommendations.

A CASE STUDY (CONT.)
To illustrate how our proposed framework HDInt contributes to un-
biased and true news recommendations in a more straightforward
manner, we conduct a case study on one of the real-world datasets,
namely the GossipCop dataset, which we use in our experiments.
Specifically, we randomly select 5 users from the GossipCop dataset.
For each user, we display their current reading history (referred to
as ‘context news’) alongside the corresponding recommendation
list generated by our HDInt model.
The results are presented in Table 5, where each user is repre-
sented by two rows: the first row displays the context news read
sequentially by the user, and the second row showcases the top-5
news pieces recommended to the user based on their context news.
From this table, we observe the following findings:
•Finding 1: Users may read left leaning, right leaning or neutral news
for the same/related events, which may be true or fake. Table 5
reveals noteworthy patterns. For instance, user 1and user 3mainly
read left-leaning news, which encompasses both true news and
fake news. For user 4and user 5, their reading history consists
solely of fake news.•Finding 2: For the users who have read news with polarity bias for
certain interests, our model is able to recommend the correspond-
ing unbiased news list for the same/related news events/topics to
counteract the biased news. For instance, let’s consider user 1, who
has previously read a piece of left biased news related to the
topic “Trump and North Korea”, denoted as CN 2. In this case, our
model recommended a piece of neutral news also pertaining to
the same topic, labeled as RN 5. Similar instances can be readily
identified for all the other four users presented in the table. This
serves as direct confirmation of the effectiveness of our proposed
model in mitigating the polarity bias of news.
•Finding 3: For the users who have read fake news for certain interests,
our model is able to recommend the corresponding true news for
the same/related topics to counteract the fake news. Consider user 3
as an example. He/She has previously encountered a piece of
fake news related to the event “Chris Pratt divorce”, referred to
as CN 3. In this instance, our model recommends a piece of true
news regarding the same topic, labeled as RN 3, and successfully
hit the ground truth. Similar scenarios can be readily identified
for all the other four users presented in the table. This serves as
direct confirmation of the effectiveness of our proposed model
in mitigating fake news by recommending corrective true news.
