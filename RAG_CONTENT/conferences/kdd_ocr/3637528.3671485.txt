Abstract
The goal of the 22ndInternational Workshop on Data Mining in
Bioinformatics (BIOKDD 2023) is to encourage KDD researchers
to solve the numerous problems and challenges in Bioinformatics
using Data Mining technologies. Based on the organizers’ expertise
and communities, BIOKDD 2023 features the theme “Large-Scale
Data-Driven Methods for Bioinformatics”. This theme encourages
the use of high-performance computing (HPC) to support the train-
ing of large machine learning models for problems in Bioinformatics
and Computational Biology. The key goal is to accelerate the con-
vergence between Data Mining and Bioinformatics communities to
expedite discoveries in basic biology, medicine and healthcare.
The goal of the 23rdInternational Workshop on Data Mining in
Bioinformatics (BIOKDD 2024) is to encourage KDD researchers
to solve the numerous problems and challenges in Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics with LLMs and GenAI”. This theme encourages the
use of large language models and generative artificial intelligence
to solve problems in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.
The key goal is to accelerate the convergence between Data Mining
and Bioinformatics communities to expedite discoveries in basic

1 Introduction
Bioinformatics is the science of managing, mining, and interpreting
information from biological data, and data mining plays an essential
role in addressing the fundamental problems in Biomedical Infor-
matics. The annual BIOKDD workshop is an established forum for
researchers and practitioners of Biomedical Informatics and Data
Mining to explore cutting-edge techniques and to exchange ideas
and experiences. BIOKDD has been successfully held in conjunction
with SIGKDD for 22 years.
The goal of the 23rdInternational Workshop on Data Mining in
Bioinformatics (BIOKDD 2024) is to encourage KDD researchers
to solve the numerous problems and challenges in Bioinformatics
using Data Mining technologies. Based on the organizers’ expertise
and communities, BIOKDD 2024 features the theme “Advancing
Bioinformatics with LLMs and GenAI”. In this year’s theme, we
encourage the use of large language models and generative artificial
intelligence for problem solving in Bioinformatics and Computa-
tional Biology. We also welcome broader research applying data
mining to address biomedical problems. A major challenge is to
discover new ways to build synergy between Data Mining and
Bioinformatics researchers that can help expedite discoveries in
the interdisciplinary areas spanning from basic biology to clinical
practice. Figure 1 shows the logo of BIOKDD 2024.
