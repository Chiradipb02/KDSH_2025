ABSTRACT
Physiological signals serve as indispensable clues for understanding
various physiological states of human bodies. Most existing works
have focused on a single type of physiological signals for a range of
application scenarios. However, as the body is a holistic biological
system, the inherent interconnection among various physiological
data should not be neglected. In particular, given the brain‚Äôs role as
the control center for vital activities, electroencephalogram (EEG)
exhibits significant correlations with other physiological signals.
Therefore, the correlation between EEG and other physiological
signals holds potential to improve performance in various scenar-
ios. Nevertheless, achieving this goal is still constrained by several
challenges: the scarcity of simultaneously collected physiological
data, the differences in correlations between various signals, and
the correlation differences between various tasks. To address these
issues, we propose a unified physiological signal alignment frame-
work, Brant-X , to model the correlation between EEG and other
signals. Our approach (1) employs the EEG foundation model to
data-efficiently transfer the rich knowledge in EEG to other physi-
ological signals, and (2) introduces the two-level alignment to fully
align the semantics of EEG and other signals from different semantic
scales. In the experiments, Brant-X achieves state-of-the-art per-
formance compared with task-agnostic and task-specific baselines
on various downstream tasks in diverse scenarios, including sleep
stage classification, emotion recognition, freezing of gaits detection,
and eye movement communication. Moreover, the analysis on the
arrhythmia detection task and the visualization in case study fur-
ther illustrate the effectiveness of Brant-X in the knowledge transfer
from EEG to other physiological signals. The model‚Äôs homepage is

1 INTRODUCTION
Physiological signals, as indispensable biomarkers, characterize
the underlying complexities of the human body and encapsulate
a wide range of critical information about an individual‚Äôs health,
with great significance for health monitoring, disease diagnosis,
and treatment [ 22,42]. Among these, several key signals including
electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electrocar-
diogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG), are especially essen-
tial in capturing primary physiological manifestations [ 49]. For
instance, EEG signals, which record neural activity in the brain,
have been utilized to study different stages of sleep and human
emotions, aiding in diagnosing sleep-related disorders and emo-
tional health issues [ 47]. Also, EOG signals, owing to their ability to
monitor potential changes during eyeball movements, have proved
instrumental in enabling communication for individuals living with
neurodegenerative disorders [10,59]. Moreover, ECG signals, which
record the fluctuation of the heart‚Äôs bio-electric activities, have been
widely employed in investigations relating to cardiac health and
diseases [ 66]. Finally, EMG signals capture the electrical activity of
human muscles, helping the diagnosis and rehabilitation training of
neuromuscular diseases [ 2]. The applications of these physiological
signals allow clinicians to monitor individual health in real-time
and make data-driven decisions, holding far-reaching implications
for many research fields like healthcare.
Despite each physiological signal records the physiological con-
ditions of its corresponding body part, it is worth noting that the
body functions as an integrated biological system rather than some
independent components [ 68]. Thus, there exists an inherent in-
terconnection among different physiological signals. Among these,
given the brain‚Äôs role as the epicenter for controlling vital activities,
EEG exhibits significant correlations with synchronous physiological
signals from other body parts [ 29]. Specifically, in some scenarios,
since the information of single-type signal may be insufficient or

noisy, ignoring this correlation can lead to great performance losses.
Taking sleep staging as an example, as shown in Fig. 1(a), although
EEG records different brainwaves in different stages, the rapid os-
cillations of EOG are particularly essential criteria for the rapid eye
movement (REM) stage. Moreover, Sharma et al . [51] has also shown
that introducing EOG signals can bring a relative improvement of
14.98% in accuracy. Besides, the correlations between EEG and other
signals also exists in other scenarios: (1) EEG&EOG: For individu-
als with neurodegenerative disorders who can only express their
thoughts and achieve interaction through eye movements, EEG and
EOG can contribute to the development of assistive communication
systems [ 59].(2) EEG&ECG: During different emotional states in
Fig. 1(b), brain signals and heartbeats consistently present differ-
ent patterns, such that EEG and ECG can be utilized for emotion
recognition [ 20].(3) EEG&EMG: Since the abrupt muscle rigidity
(named freezing of gaits, FoG) of Parkinson‚Äôs disease is related to a
complex interplay between motor, cognitive and affective factors,
EEG and EMG can be employed in FoG detection to enhance pa-
tient safety and quality of life [ 74]. Hence, the correlations between
EEG and other physiological signals (refered to as ‚ÄúEXG‚Äù in this
paper, including EOG, ECG, and EMG) hold potential to improve
performance in a variety of scenarios. Therefore, our work focuses
on establishing an EEG-centric unified framework for modeling the
correlation between EEG and EXG, which exploits the combined
information of EEG and EXG to contribute to various application
scenarios. However, current researches leave much to be explored
in this direction, primarily due to the following challenges.
From the viewpoint of data, simultaneously collected EEG
and EXG signals face a conspicuous lack of data. Due to the
acquisition costs, ethical restrictions, and a lack of emphasis on
the signal correlation in current machine learning research, the
majority of physiological data records only a single type of signal,
such as EEG datasets of several terabytes in size [ 19]. In contrast,
available multi-type physiological datasets, which contain various
physiological data collected simultaneously, are much smaller in
scale, most being less than a few gigabytes. Therefore, the scarcity
of simultaneously collected EEG and EXG data poses challenges intraining a unified framework for modeling the correlation between
EEG and EXG.
From a method perspective, there exist significant inherent
differences in correlations between EEG and different EXG
signals. Different types of physiological signals differ greatly in
their inherent properties such as amplitude and bandwidth [ 58].
To satisfy the sampling theorem [ 50], the huge gap in bandwidth
further leads to differences in sampling rates. Specifically, due to
the gap in bandwidth, the sampling rates for EOG, ECG, and EMG
may vary respectively within the ranges of 50-100Hz, 250-500Hz,
and 1000-2000Hz. These discrepancies are also evident in other
features like typical waveforms and rhythmicity [ 58]. The above
factors result in vast inherent differences in correlations between
EEG and different EXGs, posing a challenge to the unified modeling
method of EEG-EXG correlation.
From the viewpoint of task, in different scenarios, various
downstream tasks depend on different correlations even be-
tween EEG and the same EXG. Given that different application
scenarios involve different physiological activities of body organs,
different downstream tasks need to capture different correlations
between EEG and even the same EXG. Specifically, since the phys-
iological changes during sleep is relatively slow, in sleep staging
task, the EEG-EOG correlation is required to capture on a scale up
to 30sec, which is defined as a sleep stage [ 7]. In contrast, in eye
movement communication task, eyeball movements may occur in
less than 1sec, depending on different EEG-EOG correlation from
sleep staging [ 24]. Therefore, it is challenging to capture different
EEG-EXG correlations for various downstream scenarios.
To tackle the above issues, we propose a contrastive-learning-
based framework named Brant-X , to efficiently align EEG and EXG
signals from different semantic scales for the modeling of corre-
lation between EEG and EXG. To address the scarcity of simul-
taneously collected EEG and EXG data, our intuitive idea is to
use models trained with a large amount of EEG data to empower
the representation learning on EXG signals. Inspired by large lan-
guage models that are widely applied in other research fields like
computer vision [ 39,63], we employ the EEG foundation model
Brant-2 [ 70,73], which is pre-trained on 4TB brain signal data
and contains 1B parameters. Based on this, we summarize existing
public multi-type physiological datasets1, to perform data-efficient
knowledge transfer from EEG to EXG. Observing that the gaps be-
tween tasks primarily stem from the differences in semantic scales of
correlation, to address the gaps among various signals and tasks, we
introduce the two-level alignment that aligns the semantics of EEG
and EXG at both patch- and sequence-level. The patch-level align-
ment overcomes finer inherent differences and captures EEG-EXG
correlation at a smaller semantic scale, while the sequence-level one
aligns coarser differences and captures the correlation at a larger
scale. Moreover, we adopt the sampling augmentation to enhance
model robustness to different sampling rates. Using the above meth-
ods, data and model resources in EEG are extended to empower the
research on other physiological signals, paving a new avenue to
model the correlations between various physiological signals.

Figure 2: Overview of the physiological signal alignment framework Brant-X .Firstly, based on the EEG foundation model, the EXG
encoder is trained by the alignment between simultaneously collected EEG and EXG data. Then, the EEG and EXG encoders, capable of learning
strong representations from EEG and EXG signals, are applied to various downstream tasks in diverse scenarios.
To validate the effectiveness of Brant-X , extensive experiments
show that Brant-X achieves SOTA performance on various down-
stream tasks across diverse scenarios involving EEG and EXG sig-
nals, including sleep stage classification, emotion recognition, freez-
ing of gaits detection, and eye movement communication. The anal-
ysis on the arrhythmia detection task and the visualization in case
study further demonstrate that Brant-X can effectively transfer the
knowledge from EEG to EXG signals through alignment. Overall,
our key contributions comprise:

work to model the correlations between EEG and other physio-
logical signals, which can be applied to various scenarios.
‚Ä¢Based on the EEG foundation model, we adopt the two-level
alignment for data-efficient knowledge transfer from EEG to
EXG signals, which combines the semantics of EEG and EXG to
jointly improve the performance on downstream tasks.
‚Ä¢We validate Brant-X through extensive experiments on multiple
downstream tasks involving various physiological signals. More-
over, the analysis and visualization illustrate the effectiveness of
Brant-X in knowledge transfer from EEG to EXG.
2 PROPOSED METHOD
In this section, we introduce the technical details of the proposed
framework Brant-X . Specifically, as shown in the upper left part
of Fig. 3, we first split the EEG and EXG sequences into continu-
ous data patches. Then, considering the variance in sampling rates
between physiological signals in different scenarios, we adopt the
sampling augmentation (lower left corner of Fig. 3) to enhance
the model‚Äôs robustness to changes in sampling rates. As shown
in middle part of Fig. 3, the EEG patches and EXG patches, along
with the augmented patches, are fed into the EEG and EXG encoder,
respectively, to acquire the representation of each data patch. Here
we employ the EEG foundation model Brant-2 as the EEG encoder
of our framework (details in Sec. 2.2). During the unsupervised
training process, we propose the two-level alignment (right part of
Fig. 3), which aligns the simultaneously collected patches and se-
quences at both patch- and sequence-level. After the unsupervised
alignment, the representations of EEG and EXG data output by the
two encoders will be aggregated via the attention mechanism for
various tasks in diverse scenarios.
2.1 Problem Formulation
First, we formalize the definitions of the four downstream tasks
where the experiments are conducted. The collection of physiologi-
cal signals relies on signal collection pads, referred to as electrodes,
distributed on the body part to be monitored. Multiple electrodessimultaneously record the bioelectric activity of the corresponding
organs, generating a multi-channels time series. Formally, given ùëÜ
EEG signal sequences {ùíôùëñ}ùëÜ‚àí1
ùëñ=0that correspond to ùëÜphysiological
processes, each data sequence ùíôùëñ‚ààRùê∂√óùêøincludesùê∂channels with
a length ofùêøtimestamps. The simultaneously collected EXG signals,
including Àúùê∂channels, are denoted as {Àúùíôùëñ}ùëÜ‚àí1
ùëñ=0, where Àúùíôùëñ‚ààRÀúùê∂√óùêø.
According to different tasks or scenarios, each multi-type sequence
{ùíôùëñ,Àúùíôùëñ}is annotated with a label ùë¶ùëñ‚ààRby professional physicians.
Based on the above, our research problems can be defined as:
Definition 2.1. Given EEG data sequences {ùíôùëñ}ùëÜ‚àí1
ùëñ=0and EXG data
sequences{Àúùíôùëñ}ùëÜ‚àí1
ùëñ=0, with the corresponding labels {ùë¶ùëñ}ùëÜ‚àí1
ùëñ=0, the aim
is to classify each multi-type sequence {ùíôùëñ,Àúùíôùëñ}to determine which
class it belongs to.
2.2 Foundation Models for EEG
Due to the scarcity of simultaneously collected physiological data,
it is challenging to build a unified framework for the modeling of
correlations between EEG and EXG. To address this issue, we adopt
the brain signal foundation model to perform data-efficient knowl-
edge transfer from EEG to EXG. To the best of our knowledge, only
the series of works named Brant currently serves as open-source
foundation models on brain signals, including Brant and Brant-2.
Specifically, Zhang et al . [73] provide the first off-the-shelf foun-
dation model named Brant for intracranial EEG (iEEG)2signals,
which contains 500M parameters pre-trained on 1.01TB iEEG data.
Based on Brant, Yuan et al . [70] propose the foundation model for
brain signals named Brant-2. It consists of over 1B parameters and
is pre-trained on as much as nearly 4TB mixed data (with 2.3TB
iEEG data from 26 subjects and 1.6TB EEG data from about 15,000
subjects). Our choice to use Brant-2 as the EEG encoder in our
framework was two-fold. Firstly, it is pre-trained on a large corpus
of brain signal data and can learn powerful representations from
EEG signals. More importantly, it uses pre-training data with dif-
ferent sampling rates, resulting in a heightened level of robustness
towards changes in sampling rates.
2.3 Overall Architecture
Patching. Given that physiological data are bioelectric signals,
the semantic information of the physiological states can only be
collectively expressed with multiple sampling points, rather than

planted electrodes to measure deep brain activity. However, due to the required cranial
surgery and ethical restrictions, the application of iEEG is not as widespread as EEG.

a single one. Therefore, we split a whole data sequence into sev-
eral consecutive patches to aggregate semantic information within
patches and reduce computation demand [43].
Formally, as shown in the upper left part of Fig. 3, given the ùëñ-th
multi-channel EEG data sequence ùíôùëñ‚ààRùê∂√óùêøwhereùê∂denotes the
number of EEG channels and ùêødenotes the number of timestamps
(length of the sequence), we split ùíôùëñwith length ùëÄto generate a
set of non-overlapping patches {ùíôùëñ,ùëó}ùëÉ‚àí1
ùëó=0, where ùíôùëñ,ùëó‚ààRùê∂√óùëÄand
ùëÉ=‚åäùêø/ùëÄ‚åãis the number of patches in this sequence. For the EXG
data, we apply the same patching process as above, and the symbols
are also similar. Specifically, we use Àúùíôùëñ‚ààRÀúùê∂√óÀúùêøto denote the ùëñ-th
EXG sequence, where Àúùê∂is the number of EXG channels and Àúùêøis the
sequence length. Also, {Àúùíôùëñ,ùëó}ùëÉ‚àí1
ùëó=0denotes the set of patches, where
Àúùíôùëñ,ùëó‚ààRÀúùê∂√óùëÄ.
Sampling Augmentation. Considering that different physio-
logical signals exhibit large differences in sampling rates, models
that learn representations from physiological data must be suffi-
ciently robust to changes in sampling rates. For EEG, as presented in
Sec. 2.2, Brant-2 utilize pre-training data at various sampling rates,
making it fairly robust to changes in sampling rates. Hence, serving
as the EEG encoder of our framework, it is capable of handling
differences in the sampling rate of EEG data.
For the EXG signals, to address the issue of various sampling
rates, we adopt sampling augmentation to enhance the model‚Äôs
robustness to changes in sampling rate. Specifically, as shown in
the lower left corner of Fig. 3, we both upsample the original data to
twice its original rate and downsample it to half, producing two sets
of augmented data with different sampling rates. Formally, giventhe original EXG data patches {Àúùíôùëñ,ùëó}ùëÉ‚àí1
ùëó=0, we upsample the data
to twice its sampling rate, generating the upsampled data patches
{Àúùíô‚Ä≤
ùëñ,ùëó}ùëÉ‚àí1
ùëó=0where Àúùíô‚Ä≤
ùëñ,ùëó‚ààRÀúùê∂√ó2ùëÄ. Similarly, the original patches are
also downsampled to half the sampling rate, thus obtaining the
downsampled data patches {Àúùíô‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
ùëñ,ùëó}ùëÉ‚àí1
ùëó=0where Àúùíô‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
ùëñ,ùëó‚ààRÀúùê∂√ó‚åäùëÄ/2‚åã.
In subsequent representation learning and semantic alignment
sections, the original data Àúùíô, along with the upsampled data Àúùíô‚Ä≤and
downsampled data Àúùíô‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, will be fed into the EXG encoder for model
learning purposes.
Embedding to Latent Space. For EEG data, as shown in the
middle part of Fig. 3, we feed it directly into the pre-trained EEG en-
coder (details in Sec. 2.2) to obtain the EEG representation. Formally,
ùëÉconsecutive patches {ùíôùëñ,ùëó}ùëÉ‚àí1
ùëó=0from theùëñ-th EEG data sequence
ùíôùëñwill be input into the EEG encoder, yielding the representations
{ùíëùëñ,ùëó}ùëÉ‚àí1
ùëó=0of these patches, where ùíëùëñ,ùëó‚ààRùê∑ùëùdenotes the represen-
tation of the ùëó-th patch from the ùëñ-th sequence of EEG data, and ùê∑ùëù
denotes the dimension of patch representations.
When it comes to EXG data, it will be fed into the EXG encoder to
obtain its representation. Formally, all the patches {Àúùíôùëñ,ùëó}ùëÉ‚àí1
ùëó=0from
theùëñ-th EXG data sequence Àúùíôùëñare input into the EXG encoder, gen-
erating their representations {Àúùíëùëñ,ùëó}ùëÉ‚àí1
ùëó=0, where Àúùíëùëñ,ùëó‚ààRùê∑ùëù. Given
that the focus of our work is the alignment framework, the specific
architecture of the EXG encoder can be flexible. For the technical
details of the EXG encoder used in this paper, please refer to App. A.
Similarly, the upsampled EXG patches {Àúùíô‚Ä≤
ùëñ,ùëó}ùëÉ‚àí1

2.4 Two-level Alignment
We adopt two-level alignment that fully aligns the semantics of
EEG and EXG signals at patch- and sequence-level, to overcome
inherent differences and capture the correlation between EEG and
EXG at different semantic scales.
Patch-level Alignment. At a finer grain, we align EEG and
EXG data at patch-level by placing the simultaneous EEG and EXG
patches close together in the latent space, while mapping unrelated
patches further apart. As shown in the upper right part of Fig. 3,
since our EEG encoder is pre-trained on a large amount of data
(Sec. 2.2), it is reasonable to believe it can output representative
representations of EEG patches. Therefore, we set the EEG represen-
tation ùíëùëñ,ùëóas the anchor. The anchor ùíëùëñ,ùëóand the simultaneously
collected EXG patch Àúùíëùëñ,ùëóare set as the positive sample pair. Negative
samples are randomly selected from the representations {Àúùíëùëö}ùëö‚â†ùëñ
from other EXG data sequences. It is noteworthy that, contrary to
the sequence-level alignment described later, we can‚Äôt randomly
select the representations {Àúùíëùëñ,ùëõ}ùëõ‚â†ùëófrom the EXG sequence Àúùíëùëñas
negative samples. This is because these representations {Àúùíëùëñ,ùëõ}ùëõ‚â†ùëó
and the anchor originate from the same physiological process and
may have a temporal dependency between them. Formally, for
the anchor ùíëùëñ,ùëó, the negative sample set ùëçùëù
ùëñ,ùëóis randomly sampled
from all the negative samples {Àúùíëùëö,ùëõ|ùëö‚â†ùëñ,ùëõ=0,...,ùëÉ‚àí1}. The
InfoNCE [ 44] loss is applied to retain the maximum mutual infor-
mation between positive pairs:

Similarly, the same alignment process would also exist between
the EEG data and the two sets of augmented EXG data. These
two losses are denoted as L‚Ä≤ùëùandL‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ùëù, respectively. Overall, the

Sequence-level Alignment. At a coarser granularity level, we
employ sequence-level alignment to align the corresponding se-
quence in the latent space. To aggregate the representations of
patches from a data sequence, we firstly perform a linear projection
ùëäùëùùëüùëúùëó‚ààRùê∑ùë†√óùëÉùê∑ùëùon all patch representations ùíëùëñ,:‚ààRùëÉ√óùê∑ùëùfrom
sequence ùíôùëñ, thus obtaining the sequence representation ùíîùëñ‚ààRùê∑ùë†,
whereùê∑ùë†denotes the dimension of sequence representations:
ùíîùëñ=ùëäùëùùëüùëúùëó Flatten(ùíëùëñ,:). (3)
This linear projection is applied similarly for EXG data Àúùíëùëñ,:and the
augmented data Àúùíë‚Ä≤
ùëñ,:,Àúùíë‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
ùëñ,:as well, yielding the sequence representa-
tions Àúùíîùëñ,Àúùíî‚Ä≤
ùëñand Àúùíî‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
ùëñrespectively.
After obtaining the sequence representations, we set the rep-
resentations of simultaneously collected EEG and EXG sequences
(ùíîùëñand Àúùíîùëñ) as positive sample pairs, while all other sequence pairs
are set as negative pairs. Formally, the negative sample set ùëçùë†
ùëñof
sequence ùíîùëñis randomly sampled from all the negative samples
{Àúùíîùëö|ùëö‚â†ùëñ}. The sequence-level InfoNCE loss Lùë†for the EEG andthe original EXG data can be given as follows:
Lùë†=1

whereùë°ùë†denotes the temperature hyperparameter. As shown in
the bottom right part of Fig. 3, following the common practice in
CLIP [48], we adopt a similarity matrix to optimize this objective.
Likewise, we carry out the same alignment process between EEG
and augmented EXG data, resulting in two losses L‚Ä≤ùë†andL‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ùë†in
the same form. The overall loss in sequence-level alignment is:
L‚àó
ùë†=Lùë†+L‚Ä≤
ùë†+L‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
ùë†. (5)
Finally, the objective of joint optimization is obtained by adding
the patch-level and sequence-level alignment losses L‚àóùëùandL‚àóùë†.
3 EXPERIMENT
3.1 Experimental Setup
Alignment. To align the simultaneously recorded EEG and arbi-
trary EXG data, the training data used for unsupervised alignment
is collectively assembled from three datasets: CAP [ 57], ISRUC [ 32],
and HMC [ 4], which include EEG, EOG, ECG, and EMG signals.
Overall, the alignment training data includes 359 recordings from
267 subjects. The alignment is performed on a Linux system with 2
CPUs (AMD EPYC9654 96-Core Processor) and 2 GPUs (NVIDIA
Tesla A100 80G). The learning rate of EEG encoder is set as 1√ó10‚àí5
for finetuning, while the EXG encoder is trained with a higher
learning rate of 3√ó10‚àí4.
Downstream Tasks. Here we introduce the four downstream
tasks used to validate the effectiveness of our Brant-X , along with
the datasets, setups and and evaluation metrics.
‚Ä¢Sleep Stage Classification. In sleep health research, sleep staging
refines human understanding of sleep states and patterns, which
holds significance for the prevention and diagnosis of sleep-related
diseases [ 47]. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine
(AASM) manual [ 7], sleep occurs in five stages: wake, N1, N2, N3,
and REM. Among these, N1 to N3 are non-rapid eye movement sleep,
with each stage leading to progressively deeper sleep. Hence, sleep
stage classification is a five-class classification problem.
As for the dataset, the Sleep-EDF datasets [ 31] are very popular
in sleep staging researches. The Sleep-EDF-78 dataset contains 153
whole-night polysomnographic sleep recordings from sleep cassette
studies, containing 100Hz EEG and EOG data from 78 subjects aged
25-101 years (37 males and 41 females). Data are segmented into
30sec epochs and manually annotated by experts. The Sleep-EDF-20
dataset, which contains 39 recordings from 20 subjects, is also used
in our study to facilitate the comparison with the existing methods.
The experiment is conducted on EEG and EOG signals in a
subject-independent setting. We divide the subjects into training,
validation, and test sets in a 3:1:1 ratio. The experiments are re-
peated on all subjects to obtain overall results. The evaluation
metrics include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, macro F1 score,
and Cohen‚Äôs kappa ùúÖ.
‚Ä¢Emotion Recognition. Automatic emotion recognition has made
a remarkable entry in the domain of biomedical, brain-computer
4159KDD ‚Äô24, August 25‚Äì29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Daoze Zhang, Zhizhang Yuan, Junru Chen, Kerui Chen, and Yang Yang
interface, smart environment, safe driving and so on [ 28]. Emo-
tions are categorized into two types: (1) discrete emotions like joy,
fear and sadness; and (2) multi-dimensional emotions on three
emotion dimensions: arousal, valence, and dominance dimensions.
Existing works [ 30,35,36,54,56] mainly focus on the recogni-
tion of multi-dimensional emotions, so the task can be regarded as
three independent binary classification problems: low/high valence,
low/high arousal and low/high dominance.
The DREAMER dataset [ 30] is used to conduct experiments on
emotion recognition task. It contains EEG (128Hz) and ECG (256Hz)
data of 23 subjects (14 males and 9 females) when they are watching
18 film clips. Each film clip has an average length of 199s, which is
thought to be sufficient for eliciting single emotion. After watching
a film clip, emotion statuses are labeled as low or high on the three
emotion dimensions, serving as the labels for emotion recognition.
The experiment in this task is conducted on EEG and ECG signals
in a subject-independent setting. We split subjects into training,
validation, and test sets in a 3:1:1 ratio and repeat the experiments on
all subjects. The evaluation metrics are mainly accuracy [ 35,36,56],
with some studies [ 30,54] also including the F1 score and the AUC
of precision-recall curve.
‚Ä¢Freezing of Gaits Detection. FoG, which refers to the interruption
of the motion caused by the brain‚Äôs incompetence to deal with
concurrent cognitive and motor request, affects about 50%-80% of
Parkinson‚Äôs disease patients as one of the severest manifestations.
Thus, accurate detection of FoG can significantly improve patients‚Äô
life quality and promote personalized treatment [ 74]. The FoG
detection task is a binary classification problem, that is, determining
whether FoG appears during a walking process.
The FoG dataset [ 74] is used in this work, which includes EEG
and EMG signals (1000Hz) collected from 12 Parkinson‚Äôs disease
patients (6 males and 6 females) aged 57-81 years with disease
durations between 1 and 20 years. The valid data lasts for 3h42min,
including 2h14min of normal gait and 1h28min of freezing of gait,
labeled by two qualified physicians.
The experiment in this task is conducted on EEG and EMG. The
training, validation, and test data are randomly split in a 3:1:1 ratio.
We also repeat the experiments to obtain the overall results. As a
classification problem, the evaluation metrics used for this task are
accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
‚Ä¢Eye Movement Communication. Due to paralysis caused by neu-
rodegenerative disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
many patients lost almost all their communication abilities [ 24], and
only have remnant oculomotor control to form words, phrases, and
sentences using a speller system [ 59]. The speller system works on
a binary principle where the patient responds to auditory questions
by moving their eyes to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù and not moving the eyes for ‚Äúno‚Äù.
Therefore, the eye movement communication task is also a binary
classification problem (yes or no).
The dataset published by Jaramillo-Gonzalez et al . [24] is used
for the eye movement communication experiment. The dataset
contains EEG and EOG data (500Hz) recorded from four patients
suffering from ALS. Data are recorded during 2-10 visits, each visit
consisting of an average of 3.22 days with 5.57 sessions recorded
per day. Due to the inconsistency in EOG channels across differentfiles in the dataset, we exclude files lacking specific EOG channels
to conduct the experiment.
The experiment in this task is conducted using EEG and EOG.
Experiments are conducted on training, validation, and test data
split 8:1:1 and are repeated on all data files. The evaluation metrics
are accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
As for data pre-processing, for the three tasks except eye move-
ment classification, we did not perform filtering or other processing,
directly using the preprocessed data of the original datasets. For
the eye movement dataset, as the publisher didn‚Äôt filter, we applied
45Hz low-pass filtering and z-score normalization.
Baselines. As a unified unsupervised alignment framework for
physiological signal modeling, we compare Brant-X with the ad-
vanced self-supervised or unsupervised methods designed for gen-
eral time series on all the downstream tasks, including TF-C [ 75]
and SimMTM [ 15]. Also, to compare Brant-X with the methods that
performs time series classification based on pre-trained language
models, we set OneFitsAll [ 76] and Time-LLM [ 27] as a baseline. As
for the supervised methods, MiniRocket [ 14] is selected as our base-
line due to its efficiency and versatility. Furthermore, we compare
Brant-X with the SOTA methods that are specially designed for
each task, to demonstrate the effectiveness of Brant-X in various
scenarios. These task-specific or signal-specific supervised methods
includes: (1) TinySleepNet [ 55], XSleepNet [ 45], L-SeqSleepNet [ 46],
SleepHGNN [ 25], SleepKD [ 34], and SleepDG [ 62] for sleep stage
classification; (2) MLF-CapsNet [ 36], EEG-Conformer [ 52], Lin et al .
[35] and Wang et al . [64] for emotion recognition; (3) Aly and
Youssef [5], Batool and Javeed [6]and Goel et al . [17] for freez-
ing of gaits detection; and (4) eyeSay [ 77], Adama and Bogdan [1]
and Hossieny et al . [23] for eye movement communication. More
details about these baselines are given in App. B.

3.2 Experimental Results
Fig. 4 summarizes the overall accuracy of Brant-X and other base-
lines on various downstream tasks (including the arrhythmia de-
tection in Sec. 3.3). Since the task-specific methods vary across
different tasks, we use ‚ÄúTask-specific Methods‚Äù to collectively rep-
resent their best results on each task. As shown in Fig. 4, compared
with other baseline methods, Brant-X achieves SOTA performance
on all of the five tasks, illustrating the effectiveness of our frame-
work in various scenarios. Detailed comparisons on each task are
discussed in following paragraphs, where in all the tables we mark
values ranking the first (v), second ( v) and third (v*) in each column.

The performance comparison on sleep stage classification task
is given in Tab. 1. It shows that Brant-X achieves top rankings
in almost all performance metrics, demonstrating that Brant-X
can effectively transfer the knowledge from EEG to EOG signals,
combining the information of both EEG and EOG signals to learn the
high-level semantic information therein. The baselines on general
time series did not yield good results, mainly because these models
struggle to overcome the huge gap in inherent features between
various physiological signals, and do not model correlations from
different semantic scales like Brant-X does.Table 4: Average performance on the eye movement commu-

As shown in Tab. 2, on emotion recognition task, Brant-X achieves
SOTA performance compared to all the baselines. Compared to the
baselines designed solely for EEG, Wang et al . [64] claims the second
spot, because it adopt the same strategy as Brant-X for combin-
ing the information of both EEG and ECG, thereby demonstrating
stronger learning capabilities. However, Brant-X still surpasses
Wang et al . [64] on all metrics, benefiting from alignment training
based on contrastive learning.

tasks, showing its ability to learn representations from simulta-
neously collected EEG, EMG, and EOG data. Batool et al. [ 6] and
Adama et al. [ 1] achieve the second-best performance on these
two tasks, respectively, mainly because they explicitly extract the
frequency domain information of physiological signals as inherent
features for physiological data modeling.
3.3 Ablation Study
To evaluate the effectiveness of each component in Brant-X , we
conduct ablation experiments on four model variants, including: (1)
Brant-X w/o sampling-aug :Brant-X without the sampling augmen-
tation during alignment; (2) Brant-X w/o patch-align :Brant-X with-
out the patch-level alignment; (3) Brant-X w/o seq-align :Brant-X
without the sequence-level alignment; (4) Brant-X w/o EEG-encoder :
Brant-X without the EEG encoder during downstream evaluation
after alignment; (5) Brant-X w/o EXG-encoder :Brant-X without the
EXG encoder during downstream evaluation after alignment.
The comparison results of the ablation experiments on the four
downstream tasks are presented in Fig. 5. It demonstrates that
Brant-X outperforms other variants on all metrics of all the tasks,
evidencing the contribution of each component in our framework.
Compared to the full Brant-X , the performance of Brant-X w/o
sampling-aug decreases, showing the boost of model robustness
against variable sampling rates provided by the sampling augmenta-
tion. Also, Brant-X w/o patch-align andBrant-X w/o seq-align show
a decrease in performance, suggesting that the two-level alignment
can align EEG and EXG signals from different semantic scales to
learn informative representations from physiological data. For sleep
staging and emotion recognition, Brant-X w/o EEG-encoder drops
greatly in performance, as EEG signals play an important role in
these scenarios. This corroborates the significance of the brain as a
central control in vital activities, as we emphasized in Sec. 1.
EXG Encoder Analysis. As a supplement to the Brant-X w/o EEG-
encoder in the ablation experiments, we extend our assessment to
more tasks using the standalone EXG encoder, to validate whether
the EXG encoder can learn useful representations from EXG data
during the alignment training. Specifically, we conduct experiments
with the aligned EXG encoder on ECG data (without incorporating
the EEG encoder on EEG data) on the arrhythmia detection task.More details about this task and the results are given in App. C.
As shown in Tab. 5, Brant-X achieves SOTA performance on the
arrhythmia detection task, showing that the alignment training
indeed enables the EXG encoder to learn the representations from
ECG signals, and then effectively classify cardiac rhythms.
3.4 Case Study
Fig. 6 displays four similarity matrices between patch representa-
tions of two multi-type physiological data sequences, {ùíôùëñ,Àúùíôùëñ}and
{ùíôùëó,Àúùíôùëó}. The vertical axis represents the patch representations of
two EEG sequences, ùíôùëñandùíôùëó, and the horizontal axis represents
the patch representations of two EXG sequences, Àúùíôùëñand Àúùíôùëó. Thus,
four similarity matrices are given in Fig. 6. The darker the colour
of each small square, the higher the normalised similarity between
the representations of two corresponding patches.
Among these, matrix (a) (or (d)) indicates the similarity of patch
representations of simultaneously collected EEG sequence ùíôùëñ(or
ùíôùëó) and EXG sequence Àúùíôùëñ(or Àúùíôùëó). It presents an overall darker
colour, demonstrating the correlations between patches from the
simultaneously collected EEG and EXG sequence. Moreover, the
diagonal of matrix (a) (or (d)) is particularly dark, indicating that
the simultaneous EEG and EXG patches are well-aligned. However,
as for matrices (b) and (c), they have an overall lighter colour,
suggesting little to no correlation between patch representations
of non-simultaneously collected EEG and EXG data. These four
similarity matrices in this case illustrate well that the two-level
alignment can bring the representations of simultaneous EEG and
EXG data closer, while distancing irrelevant sequences, such that
Brant-X can perform knowledge transfer from EEG to EXG.
4 RELATED WORK
Physiological Signal Modeling. With the maturation of physio-
logical recording technology and the advancement of machine learn-
ing methods, physiological signal modeling has captivated many
researchers. Initially, researchers mainly focus on model learning
on a single type of signal. A large body of works propose to use time
series [ 18,36,37,45,52,55,71] or graph [ 8,12,35] data structures
with supervised [ 18,35‚Äì37,45,52,55] or self-supervised [ 8,12,71]
learning paradigms for various tasks on EEG signals. Recently, some
large EEG models [ 26,70,73] also emerged, which break through
the limitations of different tasks on EEG. Also, methods based on
feature engineering or supervised learning are proposed to learn

representations from EOG [ 1,23,77], ECG [ 3,40], and EMG [ 41,72]
signals. Additionally, to fully mine the potential semantics of physi-
ological data, research attention has been drawn to the modeling of
multi-type signals. Jia et al . [25] consider the interactivity of EEG,
EOG and EMG signals, imporving the SOTA performance on sleep
staging task. Wang et al . [64] fuse the features from single-lead EEG
and ECG data for emotion recognition. Aly and Youssef [5]propose
an approach that integrates EEG with EMG signals, boosting the
performance of hand and wrist motion control. However, most
works on physiological signals are task-specific or signal-specific.
They neither leverage foundation models (thus are hindered by
the data scarcity), nor possess a unified framework for various
physiological signals across a range of tasks.
Multimodal Alignment. To capitalize on the information con-
sistency in multimodal data, contrastive-learning-based alignment
strategy has achieved impressive results in many fields like image-
text [ 48,67,69]. For physiological research, methods [ 9,11] conduct
alignment to the features of images for medical images segmenta-
tion. Wang et al . [61] aligns the paired medical image and radiology
reports (text) for image classification and object detection, etc. Fan
et al. [16] propose a domain adaptation approach to bridge the gap
between the EEG data distribution of source and target domains for
sleep staging. Lv et al . [38] reinforce features by aligning the visual
and acoustic modality within video clips for emotion recognition.
However, these studies primarily explore the consistency among
text, image, or audio modalities, none of which explicitly align the
simultaneously collected physiological signals.
Time seires Modeling. Time series (TS) analysis has been utilized
in many real-world applications, including finance, meteorology,
healthcare, and so on, attracting more and more researchers. Wu
et al. [65] propose TimesNet as a task-general backbone to discover
the multi-periodicity adaptively for TS analysis. Dong et al . [15]
propose to recover masked time points by the weighted aggrega-
tion of multiple neighbors outside the manifold for TS modeling.
Zhou et al . [76] propose a unified model that leverages language or
vision models for TS analysis. Jin et al . [27] present a reprogram-
ming framework named Time-LLM to repurpose large language
models for general TS forecasting. However, most TS works cannotadapt well to high-frequency physiological signals and ignore the
correlation between physiological signals.
5 CONCLUSION
In this work, we are the first to propose a unified physiological
signal alignment framework, Brant-X . Based on the EEG foundation
model, we summarize available multi-type physiological datasets,
to transfer the rich knowledge from the EEG foundation model
to EXG signals. We adopt the two-level alignment that aligns the
semantics of EEG and EXG data at both patch- and sequence-level,
to adapt to various downstream scenarios. In this way, EEG is
viewed as a bridge between the EEG foundation model and EXG
data, allowing the data and model resources in the EEG field to
empower the research on other physiological signals, paving a new
avenue to model the correlations between various physiological
signals. In the future, motivated by the positive results of Brant-X ,
it would be intriguing to explore further studies along this research
line on more physiological signals.

A DETAILS OF THE EXG ENCODER
Because the focus of this paper is to introduce our proposed align-
ment framework, the specific encoder architecture can be flexible.
The model architecture of the EXG encoder used in this paper are
introduced here.
Since physiological signals are bioelectric signals, the time do-
main provides information about the amplitude and duration, whilethe frequency domain can reveal the oscillation patterns and under-
lying biological rhythms [ 33]. Therefore, to combine the informa-
tion from both time and frequency domains, in our EXG encoder,
we first calculate the power spectral density (PSD) [ 53], which de-
scribes the distribution of the signal‚Äôs total average power over
frequency, as the information in frequency domain. Then, a con-
volutional neural network (CNN) performs on the PSD to extract
features in the frequency domain of the EXG signal. The extracted
features in the frequency domain will be concatenated with the
convolution-derived features in the time domain, serving as the
features within a single patch. Due to the fact that physiological sig-
nals are time series, each patch has a temporal dependency with its
contextual patches from the same sequence. With this in mind, the
features of consecutive patches from a sequence will be fed into the
Transformer [ 60] to obtain a more comprehensive representation
that considers temporal dependencies.

B DETAILS OF BASELINES
Firstly, we compare Brant-X with the existing self-supervised or
unsupervised works on genral time series. The Details of these
baseline models are given here:
‚Ä¢TF-C [ 75]: A decomposable pre-training model for general time
series modeling, where the self-supervised signal is provided by
the distance between time and frequency components.
‚Ä¢SimMTM [ 15]: A pre-training framework on time series to re-
cover masked time points by the weighted aggregation of multi-
ple neighbors outside the manifold.
Also, we compare Brant-X with the methods that performs time
series classification based on pre-trained language models. Hence,
we set OneFitsAll [76] as a baseline:
‚Ä¢OneFitsAll [ 76]: A unified model that leverages language or vision
models for time series analysis, leading to a comparable or SOTA
performance in all main time series analysis tasks.
Furthermore, to illustrate the effectiveness of Brant-X in various
application scenarios, we compare our framework with the SOTA
methods those are specially designed for each of the four down-
stream tasks. These supervised methods includes:
(1) For the sleep stage classification task:
‚Ä¢TinySleepNet [ 55]: An end-to-end model based on CNN and
LSTM for automatic sleep stage scoring on raw single-channel
EEG with a less number of trainable parameters.
‚Ä¢XSleepNet [ 45]: A sequence-to-sequence sleep staging model
that is capable of learning a joint representation from both raw
signals and time-frequency images.

baselines designed for only one type of physiological signal (EEG
or EXG), we take their best results on the following three settings

the representation from EEG and EXG.
C ANALYSIS ON THE ARRHYTHMIA
DETECTION TASK
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac ar-
rhythmia, occurring in about 2% of the general population and is
associated with significant mortality and morbidity through asso-
ciation of risk of death, stroke, heart failure and coronary artery
disease [ 13]. Therefore, accurate rhythm classification and arrhyth-
mia detection are vital to the prevention and treatment of heart
disease. Depending on the different classifications of cardiac states,
the task can be viewed as a multi-classification problem.
The AFDB dataset [ 13] comprises 12,186 single lead ECG record-
ings of 30 and 60sec long, gathered from subjects undergoing long-
haul mobile ECG checking. Data are collected at 300Hz, and each
sample may belong to one of four classes: (1) normal sinus rhythm,
(2) AF, (3) other rhythm, or (4) too noisy to classify. In our experi-
ment, we remove the noisy samples so that this task is a three-class
classification problem.
As a supplement to Brant-X w/o EEG-encoder in the ablation
study, we conduct this experiment with the aligned EXG encoder
on ECG data (without incorporating the EEG encoder on EEG data).
The experiment is conducted on training, validation and test data
in a 3:1:1 ratio and repeated to obtain the overall results. For each of
the above three classes, we use sensitivity, specificity and precision
as metrics to evaluate the performance of our aligned EXG encoder
and other baselines. We also report the overall accuracy as an overall
assessment of model performance. In line with the main experi-
ments on the four main tasks, besides TF-C [ 75], SimMTM [ 15] and
OneFitsAll [ 76], we also compare our EXG encoder with the SOTA
methods in the field of arrhythmia detection to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model. These methods includes DeepArr [ 40]
and Alamatsaz et al. [3].
As shown in Tab. 5, our Brant-X beats all of the baselines on
the arrhythmia detection task. This demonstrates that the phase of
alignment training empowers the EXG encoder to effectively learn
semantic representations from ECG and classify cardiac rhythms.
