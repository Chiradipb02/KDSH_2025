Abstract
Recommender systems require the simultaneous optimization of
multiple objectives to accurately model user interests, necessitating
the application of multi-task learning methods. However, existing
multi-task learning methods in recommendations overlook the spe-
cific characteristics of recommendation scenarios, falling short in
achieving proper gradient balance. To address this challenge, we
set the target of multi-task learning as attaining the appropriate
magnitude balance and the global direction balance, and propose
an innovative methodology named GradCraft in response. Grad-
Craft dynamically adjusts gradient magnitudes to align with the
maximum gradient norm, mitigating interference from gradient
magnitudes for subsequent manipulation. It then employs projec-
tions to eliminate gradient conflicts in directions while considering
all conflicting tasks simultaneously, theoretically guaranteeing the
global resolution of direction conflicts. GradCraft ensures the con-
current achievement of appropriate magnitude balance and global
direction balance, aligning with the inherent characteristics of rec-
ommendation scenarios. Both offline and online experiments attest
to the efficacy of GradCraft in enhancing multi-task performance in
recommendations. The source code for GradCraft can be accessed

1 Introduction
Recommender systems assume a pivotal role in personalized in-
formation filtering, significantly shaping individual online expe-
riences [ 7,43,47]. The effectiveness of the systems often hinges
on the ability to thoroughly model user interests, which typically
entails simultaneously optimizing multiple user feedback that re-
flects different facets of user satisfaction [ 29,30,44]. For instance, a
short video recommender system needs to optimize both the time of
watching a video and the likelihood of liking it [ 1,2]. Consequently,
there has been an increasing trend towards applying multi-task
learning in recommender systems to model the various facets of
user satisfaction simultaneously [ 39], forming the mainstream ap-
proach in major industry applications [26, 35].
Multi-task learning aims to optimize multiple objectives simul-
taneously. Current approaches in recommendation predominantly
involve the direct application of general multi-task optimization
methods from machine learning. These methods typically focus on
achieving a proper balance among tasks to prevent negative transfer
effects [ 26] from two gradient perspectives. The first line of work in-
volves reweighting loss, adjusting the gradient magnitudes based on
specific criteria such as uncertainty [ 5] and update speed [ 4,18,24]

to effectively balance attention across different tasks. However,
these methods exhibit limitations in handling task conflicts, show-
ing unstable performance [ 12], especially when confronted with
significant task heterogeneity like recommendation. The second
line of work concentrates on manipulating gradient directions to di-
minish negative cosine similarity between tasks [ 21,22,34,40,42].
However, their gradient manipulation is typically executed in pairs,
lacking the assurance of global non-conflict. Additionally, their
manipulation overlooks interference from gradient magnitudes.
These limitations significantly affect their efficacy, particularly in
recommendation scenarios involving numerous tasks.
Given the pros and cons of existing methods, we distill the
essence of multi-task optimization as achieving both an appro-
priate magnitude balance and a global direction balance on
gradients, enhancing the suitability for recommendation. Firstly, it
is crucial to ensure appropriate consistency in the magnitudes of
gradients for heterogeneous recommendation tasks. The absence
of such balance may result in certain tasks dominating others [ 18],
thereby leading to subpar recommendation performance. At the
same time, it is also imperative to completely resolve any conflicts
in gradient directions across numerous recommendation tasks con-
currently, thereby ensuring global non-conflict in gradients. Failure
to do so could result in residual conflicts between some tasks, hin-
dering the transfer of knowledge and finally compromising the
efficacy of multi-task optimization.
In this work, we introduce GradCraft, a dynamic gradient balanc-
ing method for multi-task optimization. To ensure both magnitude
and direction balance simultaneously, we devise a sequential para-
digm that involves gradient norm alignment followed by direction
projection. Initially, we dynamically align gradient norms across
all tasks based on the maximum norm, establishing an appropriate
magnitude balance. Subsequently, utilizing this balanced outcome,
we apply projections to eliminate gradient conflicts in directions
while considering all conflicting tasks concurrently, thereby ensur-
ing global direction balance. In this sequential process, achieving
direction balance hinges on attaining magnitude balance, avoiding
interference from the magnitude imbalance.
Delving into further detail, in the magnitude balance, we do not
pursue an absolute gradient norm alignment across different tasks;
rather, we aim to prevent the norm differences from becoming too
pronounced (such as spanning multiple orders of magnitude), thus
averting dominance by certain tasks while preserving task speci-
ficity. In the direction balance, we move beyond mere orthogonality
after projections. Our emphasis is on requiring a certain level of
positive similarity to facilitate the positive transfer of knowledge
across tasks, thereby enhancing conflict resolution. These design
principles enable us to achieve a better balance of magnitudes and
more thorough conflict resolution. We apply GradCraft to the Pro-
gressive Layered Extraction (PLE) [ 35] model and validate it through
both offline and online experiments. The resulting empirical find-
ings consistently demonstrate GradCraft’s superior performance
in multi-task recommendation scenarios.
The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows:
•We underscore the significance of concurrently achieving appro-
priate magnitude balance and global direction balance, aligning
with the characteristics inherent in recommendation scenarios.•We introduce GradCraft, an innovative methodology that incor-
porates a flexible magnitude adjustment approach followed by a
global direction deconfliction strategy.
•We systematically conduct a series of experiments, both offline
and online, showcasing GradCraft’s effectiveness in improving
multi-task recommendations.
2 Preliminary
2.1 Multi-task Recommendation
Multi-task recommendation aims to optimize multiple recommen-
dation objectives simultaneously. Let Drepresent the historical
data. Each sample in Dis denoted as(𝒙,𝒚), where 𝒙represents the
features of a user-item pair, and 𝒚=[𝑦1,...,𝑦 𝑇]denotes𝑇distinct
task labels of user behaviors, such as Effective View [ 3,44] and
Like. The target is to learn a multi-task recommender model 𝑓𝜃that
uses 𝒙to predict the labels 𝒚by fittingD. Each task involves the
prediction of a specific label 𝑦𝑖, and corresponds to a specific loss
objectiveℓ𝑖, which can be expressed as
ℓ𝑖=𝐿(𝑓𝜃(𝒙)𝑖,𝑦𝑖;D) (𝑖 =1,...,𝑇), (1)
where𝐿denotes the common recommendation loss function, such
as Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss [ 46] and Mean Squared Error
(MSE) loss [ 10]. Here, for briefness, we omit the regularization term
which is widely adopted to prevent overfitting.
Multi-task Optimization. To optimize the multiple objectives, ex-
isting methodologies adhere to a unified paradigm: initially, the
gradients of different tasks are manipulated and then combined
into a single gradient using specialized methods; subsequently, the
model parameters are updated according to the combined result.
Each task gradient can be obtained through backpropagation. For-
mally, the gradient of the 𝑖-th task can be represented as
𝑔𝑖=∇𝜃ℓ𝑖∈R𝑑, (2)
where𝑑denotes the dimension of the model parameters. Here,
without loss of generality, we treat 𝜃and its gradient as a row
vector, even though their original form can be a matrix or tensor.
2.2 Gradient Balance
Recommendation tasks often exhibit the significant heterogeneity
across various aspects, such as data sparsity [ 2,3]. This hetero-
geneity can lead to differences in gradient magnitudes and incon-
sistencies in update directions among tasks, leading to potential
negative transfer effects [ 26]. To mitigate such effects, it is essential
to achieve magnitude and direction balance.
2.2.1 Magnitude Balance. The assessment of the magnitude of a
task gradient 𝑔𝑖typically relies on its norm [ 11], denoted as∥𝑔𝑖∥.
Magnitude balance concerns the consistency in the magnitudes of
different task gradients, aiming to prevent situations where tasks 𝑖
and𝑗exhibit a significant difference in magnitudes, expressed as
∥𝑔𝑖∥≫∥𝑔 𝑗∥𝑜𝑟∥𝑔𝑖∥≪∥𝑔 𝑗∥. (3)
The lack of magnitude balance may result in specific tasks exerting
dominance over the optimization process, ultimately leading to the
sub-optimal recommendation performance [18].

Figure 1: An overview of GradCraft. It initially adjusts the gra-
dient magnitude based on the maximum norm. Subsequently,
it performs gradient projections based on the conflicting task
gradients and aggregates the gradients to update the recom-
mender model, globally deconflicting in directions.
2.2.2 Direction Balance. Direction balance is aimed at averting
conflicts between different tasks, where conflicts are defined by
a negative cosine similarity between two task gradients [ 40,42].
Specifically, task gradients 𝑔𝑖and𝑔𝑗are considered in conflict if
the inner product between them holds
⟨𝑔𝑖,𝑔𝑗⟩<0. (4)
Achieving direction balance involves eliminating such negative
similarities. The lack of direction balance can hinder the knowledge
transfer among different recommendation tasks, finally compro-
mising the efficacy of multi-task optimization.
3 Methodology
In this section, we commence by furnishing an overview of the
proposed methodology. Subsequently, we introduce the magnitude
adjustment approach aimed at achieving appropriate magnitude
balance, and present the proposed global direction deconfliction
strategy, which aims to attain global direction balance. Finally, we
delve into a discussion of our gradient projection method.
3.1 Overview
We aim to achieve a simultaneous balance in both the gradient
magnitude and direction. To accomplish this, we propose a sequen-
tial paradigm that involves aligning gradient norms followed by
projection operations, as illustrated in Figure 1. Firstly, we dynami-
cally align gradient norms across all tasks based on the maximum
norm, establishing an appropriate balance in magnitudes. Secondly,
using this balanced outcome, we apply projections to eliminate
gradient conflicts while considering all conflicting tasks concur-
rently, ensuring a global balance in directions. Finally, we merge
the gradients and update the recommender model. Given that our
method operates at the gradient level, we name it GradCraft.
3.2 Magnitude Adjustment
In order to mitigate interference arising from differences in gradient
magnitudes across tasks, our primary focus lies in the adjustment
of gradients to ensure an appropriate level of magnitude balance.
Rather than pursuing absolute uniformity of gradient norms acrossdifferent tasks, we aim to prevent excessive differences in norms,
such as those spanning multiple orders of magnitude. This helps
avert dominance by certain tasks while preserving task specificity.
To achieve this, for each task, we adjust its gradient norm by com-
bining its original norm with the maximum norm among tasks.
Formally, the adjustment is performed as
ˆ𝑔𝑖=𝜏max 𝑗∥𝑔𝑗∥
∥𝑔𝑖∥𝑔𝑖+(1−𝜏)𝑔𝑖, (5)
where𝑔𝑖represents the original gradient of task 𝑖,max 𝑗∥𝑔𝑗∥is
the maximum gradient norm among all tasks, and ˆ𝑔𝑖denotes the
adjusted task gradient. The hyper-parameter 𝜏∈[0,1]undergoes
tuning based on validation performance. In this manner, we ensure
that the difference between the maximum and minimum gradient
norms among tasks does not exceed1
𝜏times.
3.3 Global Direction Deconfliction
After adjusting the magnitudes, we aim to achieve the global gra-
dient balance. For each task, we utilize projections to ensure its
gradient does not conflict with the gradients of all other tasks
concurrently. Subsequently, we linearly combine the deconflicted
gradients from all tasks for the final model updating.
Gradient projection. For a given task gradient ˆ𝑔𝑖, we denote the
gradients conflicting with it as 𝐺𝑖=[ˆ𝑔𝑖1,..., ˆ𝑔𝑖𝑛]∈R𝑛×𝑑, where
ˆ𝑔𝑖𝑗represents the 𝑗-th conflicting gradient. We define a projection
target to achieve non-negative similarities between the deconflicted
gradient and all conflicting gradients as
𝐺𝑖˜𝑔⊤
𝑖=𝒛,
𝒛=[𝜖∥ˆ𝑔𝑖∥∥ˆ𝑔𝑖1∥,...,𝜖∥ˆ𝑔𝑖∥∥ˆ𝑔𝑖𝑛∥],(6)
where ˜𝑔𝑖represents the deconflicted task gradient, and 𝜖≥0serves
as a factor for adjusting the desired similarity, with a higher value
indicating higher positive similarity. Notably, instead of solely pur-
suing gradient orthogonality ( 𝜖=0) between tasks, we require a
certain level of positive similarity to emphasize the positive transfer
of knowledge across tasks, thereby enhancing conflict resolution.
Theoretically, the desired gradient ˜𝑔𝑖could be obtained as the
sum of the original gradient and the projection onto the linear space
of all conflicting gradients, which can be formulated as
˜𝑔𝑖=ˆ𝑔𝑖+𝑛∑︁
𝑘=1𝑤𝑘ˆ𝑔𝑖𝑘=ˆ𝑔𝑖+𝒘⊤𝐺𝑖, (7)
where 𝒘∈R𝑛×1is a weight vector that needs to be determined.
Combining Equation (6) and Equation (7), we deduce that
𝐺𝑖𝐺⊤
𝑖𝒘=−𝐺𝑖ˆ𝑔⊤
𝑖+𝒛. (8)
Given that the dimension of model parameters significantly exceeds
the number of tasks, i.e.,𝑑≫𝑛, it is reasonable to assume that
the matrix𝐺𝑖possesses full rank [ 16]. Consequently, the positive
definiteness of 𝐺𝑖𝐺⊤
𝑖can be attained, enabling the weight vector 𝒘
to be solved in closed form as
𝒘=(𝐺𝑖𝐺⊤
𝑖)−1(−𝐺𝑖ˆ𝑔⊤
𝑖+𝒛). (9)

Algorithm summarization. The intricacies of GradCraft are eluci-
dated in Algorithm 1. During the implementation phase, updates are
performed on a batch of data. In each iteration, the algorithm com-
mences by computing all task gradients (lines 4-7). Subsequently, it
applies magnitude adjustments to ensure an appropriate magnitude
balance, avoiding interference from the gradient magnitude (lines
9-11). Following this, if conflicts arise among task gradients, a gra-
dient projection method is employed to ensure a global direction
balance for each task (lines 13-19). Ultimately, the gradients for
different tasks are combined to update the model parameters (line
21). It is important to highlight that the update process is adaptable
enough to accommodate various optimizers such as Adam [ 15]
and Adagrad [ 25]. Besides, the update process exclusively involves
updating the shared model parameters, which aligns with the ap-
proach established in previous research [42].
3.4 Discussion
Our gradient projection method can be viewed as an extension of
the normal projection method [ 42]. Under certain circumstances,Table 1: Statistical details of the evaluation datasets.
Dataset #User #Item #Intersection Density
Wechat 19,997 59,322 7,154,154 0.0060
Kuaishou 8,516 62,699 2,867,290 0.0054
our method could degrade to approximate equality with the normal
projection method. Specifically, when each given task gradient 𝑔𝑖
confronts only a single conflicting gradient denoted as 𝑔𝑖1, and the
hyper-parameter 𝜖is set to 0, the deconflicted gradient in Equa-
tion (7) is computed as
˜𝑔𝑖=ˆ𝑔𝑖−⟨ˆ𝑔𝑖,ˆ𝑔𝑖1⟩
∥ˆ𝑔𝑖1∥ˆ𝑔𝑖1. (11)
Disregarding the magnitude adjustment to gradients here, this com-
putation aligns with the normal conflict projection method.
In comparison, our method simultaneously addresses all conflict-
ing tasks for each task while requiring a certain level of positive
similarity, resulting in global and thorough conflict resolution. No-
tably, our method does not significantly introduce extra computa-
tion complexity. Considering 𝐺𝑖𝐺⊤
𝑖∈R𝑛×𝑛, where𝑛is the number
of conflicting task gradients for 𝑔𝑖, we can efficiently compute its
inverse in Equation (9) and obtain deconflicted gradients.
4 Experiment
In this section, we conduct a series of experiments to answer the
following research questions:
RQ1: How does GradCraft perform on recommendation data com-
pared to existing multi-task learning methods?
RQ2: What is the impact of the individual components of GradCraft
on its effectiveness?
RQ3: How do the specific hyper-parameters of GradCraft influence
its recommendation performance?
RQ4: How is the scalability of GradCraft across different levels of
the gradient imbalance?
RQ5: How effective is GradCraft when applied to real industry
recommender systems?
4.1 Experimental Setting
4.1.1 Datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on an open-
world dataset and our product dataset: Wechat and Kuaishou.
•Wechat. This public dataset is released as part of the WeChat
Big Data Challenge1, capturing user behaviors on short videos
over a two-week period. To ensure dataset quality, we applied
a 10-core filtering process, ensuring that each user/video has a
minimum of 10 samples.
•Kuaishou. This dataset is sourced from our Kuaishou2platform,
reflecting a real-world scenario for short video recommendations.
It comprises short video recommendation records for 10,000 users
over a five-day period. Due to the sparser nature of the dataset,
we applied a 20-core filtering process during preprocessing.
The summary statistics of the preprocessed datasets are pre-
sented in Table 1. Each dataset contains rich features of user and

video, along with diverse user feedback. We randomly split them
into training, validation, and test sets, following an 8:1:1 ratio.
In short-video recommendation, there are two types of tasks:
those related to viewing behaviors and those related to interactive
behaviors. Therefore, we set user usage time and engagement as
our optimization objectives, which are assessed using viewing la-
bels and engagement labels. Specifically, we select EffectiveView
(EV) [ 44], LongView (LV) [ 44], and CompleteView (CV) [ 1] as view-
ing labels. EV indicates whether the watch time of an example has
exceeded 50% of the overall watch time in the dataset, while LV
indicates whether the watch time has exceeded 75%. CV reflects
whether the watch time of an example has surpassed the video
duration. For engagement labels, we directly use Like, Follow, and
Forward. All labels above are binary and fitted with BCE loss.
4.1.2 Baselines. We compare the proposed GradCraft with the
following multi-task learning methods.
•Single. This approach successively assigns a weight of 1 to a
specific task and assigns weights of 0 to other tasks.
•EW. This method assigns a equal weight of 1/𝑇to each task,
where T represents the total number of tasks.
•UC[5]. This method reweighs loss based on the uncertainty.
•DWA [24]. This approach adapts the loss weights by considering
the update speed of the loss value.
•MGDA [34]. This method manipulates gradients to achieve a
local Pareto optimal solution.
•PCGrad [42]. This method addresses the gradient conflict in
directions by the pair-wise projection.
•GradVac [40]. This approach sets adaptive gradient similarity
objectives in a learnable manner to improve PCGrad.
•CAGrad [21]. This method identifies the optimal update vector
within a ball around the average gradient, maximizing the worst
local improvement between tasks.
•IMTL [22]. This approach learns weights to ensure that the ag-
gregated gradient has equal projections onto each task gradient.
•DBMTL [18]. This approach guarantees that all task gradients
share the same magnitude as the maximum gradient norm.
As our gradient projection method can be considered an extension
of the normal projection method in PCGrad, we also introduce a
variant of PCGrad to ensure fair comparisons, denoted as
•PCGrad+. This variant takes into account magnitude balance
and adjusts gradient magnitudes based on Equation (5), building
upon the foundation of PCGrad.
4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. In order to conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of performance with respect to optimizing multiple
recommendation objectives, we employ two widely recognized
accuracy metrics: AUC and GAUC [ 3]. Following previous work [ 18,
19,36], we mainly focus on the average performance across all tasks.
Specifically, we utilize both the average metric across all tasks and
the relative metric improvement compared with the Single baseline
across all tasks, which can be expressed as
AV-A(M)=1
𝑇𝑇∑︁
𝑖=1AUC 𝑖(M), (12)AV-G(M)=1
𝑇𝑇∑︁
𝑖=1GAUC 𝑖(M), (13)
RI-A(M)=1
𝑇𝑇∑︁
𝑖=1AUC 𝑖(M)− AUC 𝑖(𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒)
AUC 𝑖(𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒), (14)
RI-G(M)=1
𝑇𝑇∑︁
𝑖=1GAUC 𝑖(M)− GAUC 𝑖(𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒)
GAUC 𝑖(𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒). (15)
Here,Mrepresents the specific multi-task learning method, with
AV-A and AV-G denoting the average value of AUC and GAUC,
respectively. Similarly, RI-A and RI-G signify the relative improve-
ment in AUC and GAUC, respectively. Across all metrics, higher
values indicate better recommendation results.
4.1.4 Implementation Details. To ensure fair comparisons, we em-
ploy the PLE [ 35] model as the backbone recommender model for
all the methods under consideration. Each task is composed of a
shared expert, a task-specific expert, a gate network, and a tower
network. The experts are instantiated as DeepFM [ 8], combining
a Factorization Machine (FM) [ 31] component with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) [ 6] module. The hidden layer configuration for
the MLP is set to 256×128×64. The tower network is implemented
as an MLP with a hidden layer configuration of 32×16. The gate
network structure is based on a linear layer with Softmax [ 41] serv-
ing as the activation function. The embedding size is consistently
set to 16 for all user and video features.
In terms of model optimization, we employ the Adam opti-
mizer [ 15], setting the maximum number of optimization epochs
to 1000. Optimal models are identified based on validation results,
utilizing an early stopping strategy with a patience setting of 10.
Parameters for the backbone recommender model are initialized
using a Gaussian distribution, where the mean is fixed at 0, and
the standard deviation is set to 0.01. The dropout ratio is set to
0.2. We leverage the grid search to find the best hyper-parameters.
For our method and all baselines, we search the learning rate in
the range of{1𝑒-4, 5𝑒-4, 1𝑒-3}, the size of mini-batch in the range
of{2048, 4096}, and the𝐿2regularization coefficient in {0, 1𝑒-6,
1𝑒-5, 1𝑒-4, 1𝑒-3}. For the special hyper-parameters of baselines, we
search most of them in the ranges provided by their papers. Re-
garding our methodology, the hyper-parameter 𝜏in Equation (5)
to regulate the closeness to the maximum norm is searched within
the interval[0,1]using a step size of 0.1, and the hyper-parameter
𝜖in Equation (6)to achieve the desired similarity is searched in the
range of{0, 1𝑒-12, 1𝑒-11, 1𝑒-10, 1𝑒-9, 1𝑒-8, 1𝑒-7}.
4.2 Performance Comparison (RQ1)
We begin by assessing the overall performance of the compared
methods in optimizing multiple objectives. The summarized results
are presented in Table 2, yielding the following observations:
•GradCraft demonstrates superior performance compared to the
baselines on both datasets, excelling in metrics of AV-A, AV-G, RI-
A, and RI-G. This highlights its ability to achieve the appropriate
magnitude balance and global direction balance, showcasing its
efficacy in multi-task optimization.
•Although PCGrad+ shows improvement over PCGrad by inte-
grating the magnitude balance, it still falls short of GradCraft.

This suggests that GradCraft’s global gradient projection method
surpasses PCGrad’s pair-wise projection method, leading to the
global and thorough direction deconfliction.
•In contrast, loss reweighting methods such as EW, UC, and DWA
exhibit poor performance. Their reliance on overall loss values,
without granular gradient analysis, limits their effectiveness in en-
hancing multi-task optimization. This highlights the importance
of taking into account more fine-grained gradient magnitude and
direction for enhanced performance.
•Methods that exclusively prioritize either magnitude balance or
direction balance struggle to achieve optimal recommendation
performance and may even lead to degradation (MGDA). This
emphasizes the need of holistically addressing both magnitude
and direction balance in multi-task recommendations.4.3 Ablation Study (RQ2)
To enhance the multi-task recommendation performance in Grad-
Craft, we propose the incorporation of a magnitude adjustment ap-
proach and a gradient projection method, with two hyper-parameters
𝜏and𝜖. To substantiate the rationale behind these design decisions,
we conduct an exhaustive evaluation by systematically disabling
one critical design element at a time to obtain various variants.
Specifically, the following variants are introduced:
•GradCraft-fix 𝝐, which sets 𝜖to 0 and uses zero vector as the
projection target in Equation (6);
•GradCraft-fix 𝝉, which sets 𝜏to 1 and disables the control of
the proximity of task gradients in Equation (5);
•GradCraft-ori, which removes the magnitude adjustment and
preserves the original magnitudes without any alteration;

•GradCraft-local, which removes the global gradient projection
and replaces it with the normal projection in PCGrad.
Table 3 illustrates the comparison results on Wechat, from which
we draw the following observations:
•When GradCraft disables the factors 𝜖and the𝜏, there are de-
creases in performance across all metrics. These results confirm
the pivotal role of 𝜖in maintaining a certain level of positive
similarity to facilitate the transfer of knowledge across tasks, and
𝜏in controlling magnitude proximity levels.
•Comparatively, GradCraft-ori outperforms GradCraft-fix 𝜏. These
variants correspond to aligning the magnitude with the maxi-
mum norm and retaining the original magnitude, with 𝜏set to 1
and 0, respectively. This observation suggests that indiscriminate
adjustment of magnitude to match the maximum norm may detri-
mentally impact recommendation performance, underscoring the
significance of appropriate proximity.
•The performance of GradCraft-ori and GradCraft-local is similar,
indicating no advantage of global gradient projection over the
normal projection strategy when magnitude adjustment is absent.
However, the performance gap between GradCraft and PCGrad+
in Table 2 underscores the superiority of the gradient projection
method. This outcome can be attributed to disruption caused by
magnitudes, underscoring the critical role of initially adjusting
magnitudes to achieve magnitude balance.
4.4 In-depth Analysis (RQ3 & RQ4)
4.4.1 The Effect of Hyper-parameter 𝜏&𝜖.In our investigation,
the two factors 𝜏and𝜖assume pivotal roles in influencing the
effectiveness of GradCraft. We undertake a systematic examination
to scrutinize the impact of varying them on the performance. We
report the AV-G and RI-G for simplicity, as shown in Figure 2 and
Figure 3. It becomes evident that GradCraft achieves optimal AV-G

performance tends to deteriorate when they become excessively
large. This underscores the significance of selecting an appropriate
value for𝜏and𝜖. Further analysis reveals that when 𝜏∈[0,0.3]and
𝜖∈[1𝑒−12,1𝑒−9], the performance remains consistently stable,
indicating the robustness within the range. This stability is crucial
for ensuring reliable performance of the magnitude adjustment
approach and the gradient projection method.
4.4.2 The Effect of Task Number 𝑇.In multi-task recommenda-
tions, the degree of gradient imbalance is intricately linked to the
task number, with higher task numbers leading to an increase in
the number of potential conflicting task pairs. Consequently, we
conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate the impact of varying
task numbers on GradCraft’s performance. We also present the
performance of the best baseline for comparative analysis. Specif-
ically, we adjust the task number in the range of {2,4,6}while
ensuring an equal number of viewing labels and engagement labels.
For𝑇=2, we designate EV and Like as the tasks, and for 𝑇=4,
we incorporate EV, LV, Like, and Follow. For 𝑇=6, we use all the
labels mentioned. We depict the relative improvement metrics RI-A
and RI-G in Figure 4, and our observations are as follows:
•Both the metrics of GradCraft exhibit a consistent increase with
the task number. In contrast, the best baseline method does not
display a similar trend. This stark contrast suggests that Grad-
Craft possesses a unique capability to achieve gradient balance,

sidered significant [3].

GradCraft +0.505% +0.950% +1.746%
which scales up effectively with the increasing complexity intro-
duced by a growing number of tasks. Consequently, GradCraft
showcases its potential for practical application in complex rec-
ommendation scenarios. This enhanced performance can be at-
tributed to the implementation of flexible magnitude adjustment
and thorough direction conflict elimination in GradCraft.
•Moreover, as the number of tasks increases, the performance
gap between GradCraft and the best baseline method widens.
This expanding gap provides further evidence supporting the
advantages of GradCraft in achieving both appropriate magni-
tude balance and global direction balance at the gradient level. It
is worth mentioning that for 𝑇=2, both methods yield similar
results in terms of the RI-A and RI-G metrics. This similarity can
be attributed to the fact that when there is only one pair of tasks,
the global projection method employed by GradCraft closely re-
sembles the normal conflict projection method. This consistency
aligns with the earlier discussion presented in Equation (11).
4.5 Online Experiment (RQ5)
We conduct an online A/B experiment on our production plat-
form, leveraging traffic from over 15 million users. We assesse
three key business and engagement metrics: the average time users
spend watching videos (WT), the number of effective video view-
ing records (VV), and the instances of video sharing (Share). Our
findings, presented in Table 4, demonstrate notable performance
enhancements achieved by our method compared to the state-of-
the-art multi-task learning baseline implemented in Kuaishou.
5 Related work
In this section, we navigate through existing research on multi-task
learning, encompassing the optimization methodologies and model
architectures. Our particular emphasis is on their application within
the realm of recommender system.
5.1 Multi-task Optimization
Multi-task learning necessitates the simultaneous optimization of
multiple tasks. Prior research has proposed various optimization
methods to mitigate the imbalance among different tasks, broadly
categorized into two lines. The first category involves reweighting
loss, adjusting the gradient magnitudes based on different aspects
of the specific criteria [ 4,5,12,18,24,39]. For example, UC [ 5]
adjusts the loss weights according to the uncertainty associated
with each task, while DWA [ 24] adapts the loss weights by tak-
ing into account the rate of change of the loss value. The second
category focuses on manipulating gradient directions to diminish
the direction conflict [ 21,22,34,40,42]. For instance, MGDA [ 34]
manipulates gradients to achieve a local Pareto optimal solution.PCGrad [ 42] addresses gradient interference by pair-wise projec-
tions. CAGrad [ 21] identifies the optimal update vector within a
sphere around the average gradient and maximizes the worst local
improvement between tasks. IMTL [ 22] learns weights to ensure
that the aggregated gradient has equal projections onto each task
gradient. Among the mentioned works, CAGrad implicitly consid-
ers the gradient magnitude. However, it only imposes restrictions
on the magnitude of the update vector, rather than finely modifying
the magnitudes of each individual task like our proposed GradCraft.
In recent times, there has been a growing focus on developing tai-
lored strategies specifically for the recommender system [ 1,11,14,
20], with a particular emphasis on diverse optimization objectives.
PE-LTR [ 20] introduces a Pareto-efficient algorithmic framework
for e-commerce recommendations. LabelCraft [ 1] proposes a label-
ing model that aligns with the objectives of short video platforms.
MetaBalance [ 11] aims to achieve equilibrium among auxiliary
losses by manipulating their gradients to enhance knowledge trans-
fer for the target task. SoFA [ 14] optimizes item-side group fairness
while maintaining recommendation accuracy constraints. Among
these works, MetaBalance bears resemblance to our GradCraft as it
incorporates adjustments to gradient magnitudes. However, Meta-
Balance primarily focuses on multi-behavior learning and solely
optimizes performance on the target task. Additionally, it rigidly
employs the gradients of the target task as adjustment criteria. In
contrast, GradCraft focuses on the optimization of multiple ob-
jectives and dynamically utilizes the maximum norm of gradients
across all tasks, resulting in greater adaptability and versatility.
5.2 Multi-task Model
Multi-task models aim to excel in multiple interrelated tasks simul-
taneously, extracting shared information to enhance proficiency
in each task. While hard parameter sharing models are commonly
used, they may suffer from detrimental transfer effects due to task
disparities. To address this, soft parameter sharing models have
been introduced, such as the cross-stitch network [ 28] and sluice
network [ 32], which combine task-specific hidden layers using
linear combinations. Gating and attention mechanisms have also
been utilized for effective information fusion. Examples include
MoE [ 13], which uses a gate structure to combine various experts,
and MTAN [ 24], which incorporates task-specific attention modules
within a shared network.
In recommendations, hard parameter sharing at the bottom
(SharedBottom) [ 23] remains pervasive owing to its simplicity and
efficiency, effectively addressing the oversight of task correlations
in traditional models rooted in collaborative filtering and matrix
factorization [ 9,10,38,45]. MMoE [ 26] goes a step further by shar-
ing all experts across diverse tasks, utilizing distinct gates for each
task to augment the capabilities of the MoE framework. Conversely,
ESMM [ 27] adopts a soft parameter sharing structure, simultane-
ously optimizing two correlated tasks through sequential modes
to mitigate the sparsity inherent in the prediction target. Expand-
ing upon the shared experts paradigm in MMoE, PLE [ 35] estab-
lishes independent experts for each task, and adopts multi-level
extraction networks with progressive separation routing. Further-
more, AdaTT [ 17] enhances its capability by utilizing an adaptive
fusion mechanism, enabling the model to more effectively select

fine-grained feature representations for individual tasks. Our work
diverges from the aforementioned research as it concentrates on
optimization perspective and remains model-agnostic.
6 Conclusion
This study investigated the application of multi-task learning meth-
ods in the recommender system. Recognizing the distinct charac-
teristics of recommendations, we proposed GradCraft to simulta-
neously achieve an appropriate magnitude balance and a global
direction balance to enhance the multi-task optimization. Grad-
Craft dynamically adjusted the gradient magnitudes to align with
the maximum gradient norm to establish the appropriate magni-
tude balance, mitigating interference from gradient magnitudes
for subsequent manipulation. Subsequently, it employed projec-
tions to eliminate gradient conflicts in directions while considering
all conflicting tasks concurrently, thereby ensuring global direc-
tion balance. Extensive experiments conducted on both real-world
datasets and our production platform provided empirical evidence
of its effectiveness in enhancing multi-task recommendations.
In our future work, we will enhance the comprehensiveness
of our method by integrating the resolution of conflicting gradi-
ents with the improvement of consistency among other gradients.
Additionally, we plan to apply our method to other domains, includ-
ing Computer Vision (CV) [ 37] and Natural Language Processing
(NLP) [ 33], in order to evaluate its general applicability. Moreover,
we recognize the complexity of industrial recommendation scenar-
ios and will focus on developing more effective multi-task learning
methods tailored for large-scale industrial settings.
