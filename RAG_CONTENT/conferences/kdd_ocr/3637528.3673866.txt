1 INTRODUCTION  
Integrating advanced data science, trustworthy AI, and large 
language models into healthcare marks a pivotal shift in 
biomedical research and applications. The National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) has been instrumental in developing  robust data 
ecosystems that support AI -driven biomedical research. These 
initiatives, such as the NIH Data Commons and the Strategic Plan 
for Data Science, aim to enhance the interoperability of AI -ready 
datasets and facilitate collaborative research, emphasizing the 
importance o f ethical AI practices and the need for transparency 
and inclusivity in AI -driven healthcare research. This comprehensive approach aims to transform healthcare systems 
effectively and enhance  healthcare delivery and biomedical 
research through AI ecosystems.  
 
These efforts are crucial for constructing  AI-ready datasets, 
setting industry standards, promoting interdisciplinary 
collaborations, and focusing on ethical AI practices. This year’s 
KDD theme reflects a comprehensive approach to leveraging AI 
to transform healthcare systems effectively.  Building health AI 
ecosystems offers promising avenues for enhancing healthcare 
delivery and advancing medical research. Insights from this study 
support ongoing discussions aimed at furthering the development 
of these eco systems.  
 
Healthcare ’s intersection with data science has led to significant 
medical research and practice developments , transitioning from 
traditional data -driven methods to comprehensive AI -driven 
ecosystems. Over the years, KDD Health Day has explored various 
themes:  
• 2018: Focus on the synergy between AI/ML 
communities and healthcare experts to foster 
innovations in bioinformatics and epidemiology.  
• 2019: Discuss ion on how to  extend healthcare beyond 
conventional settings, emphasizing telemedicine and 
precision health.  
• 2020: Concentration on AI’s role in understanding and 
combating the COVID -19 pandemic.  
• 2021: Highlight ing the importance of explainability and 
trustworthiness in AI healthcare applications.  
• 2022: Exploration of AI in disease diagnosis, vaccine 
distribution, and mobile health solutions.  
• 2023: Examination of AI’s applications in clinical trials 
and the development of robust healthcare models.  
2 PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS  
The 2024 KDD Health Day feature s a series of talks, panel 
discussions, and a joint session with the BIOKDD workshop on 
bioinformatics, focusing on the practical aspects of AI ecosystems 
in healthcare.  The organizers believe that open  interdisciplinary 
dialogues between data scientists and biomedical researchers and 
robust partnerships between academia and industry are essential

 for translating AI research into practical healthcare solutions. A 
healthy ecosystem of the major stakeholders and their cooperative 
relationships can  help navigate challenges related to data privacy, 
model interpretability, and the scalability of AI technologies, 
ensuring that AI innovations are effectively implemented in real -
world settings.
