Abstract
In the realm of education, both independent learning and group
learning are esteemed as the most classic paradigms. The former
allows learners to self-direct their studies, while the latter is typi-
cally characterized by teacher-directed scenarios. Recent studies
in the field of intelligent education have leveraged deep tempo-

of students’ knowledge states, and have achieved remarkable per-

on modeling the independent learning process, with the group
learning paradigm receiving less attention. Moreover, the recip-

combined potential to foster holistic student development, remains
inadequately explored. To this end, in this paper, we propose RIGL,

1 Introduction
In the domain of education, both independent learning [ 24] and
group learning [ 41,50] are regarded as the most classic learning
paradigms. The former allows learners to self-direct their studies,
whereas the latter is typically characterized by scenarios that are
guided and structured by teachers. It is widely acknowledged that
exclusive reliance on a singular learning modality is insufficient to
promote continuous long-term development in students [6, 8].
In recent years, with the advancement of artificial intelligence
technology, the field of intelligent education has yielded notable
modeling paradigms conducive to understanding student learning
behaviors [ 1,16,23]. Among these, a foundational and potent para-
digm is knowledge tracing, which aims at dynamically monitoring
the evolving knowledge states of learners and predicting their fu-
ture performance by modeling the exercise-solving sequences [ 3].
However, most existing methods [ 7,22,25,29,45] mainly focus on
modeling independent learning behaviors, with the group learning
paradigm receiving less attention. Furthermore, the reciprocal effect
between independent and group learning, particularly their com-
bined potential to significantly drive holistic student development,
has yet to be thoroughly explored and investigated [6, 42, 44, 46].
To this end, in this paper, we introduce a new task called holis-
tic knowledge tracing (HKT), which refers to tracing knowledge
states at both the individual and group levels simultaneously, draw-
ing from independent and group learning processes. As shown in
Figure 1,RSandROindicate the interaction sequences for a stu-
dent and a group respectively, which are organized in time frames.
Each response interaction of a student and a group under each
time frame is represented by triples (𝑒𝑡
𝑖,𝑐𝑡
𝑖,𝑟𝑡
𝑖)and(𝑒𝑡
𝑖,𝑐𝑡
𝑖,𝑦𝑡
𝑖), re-
spectively, where 𝑒𝑡
𝑖and𝑐𝑡
𝑖denote the exercise and the knowledge
concept, and 𝑟𝑡
𝑖∈{0,1}as well as𝑦𝑡
𝑖∈[0,1]indicates the student’s
response and the group’s answer accuracy rate. The goal of HKT is
to model both learning processes holistically.
However, HKT is not a trivial task and encompasses the follow-
ing technical challenges. Firstly, within the real-world educational
environment, there exists a notable absence of interactive behaviorsamong students spanning various learning scenarios, particularly
within group learning processes. This absence significantly ampli-
fies the challenge of tracing knowledge states at both individual and
group levels. For instance, missing data resulting from the absence
of a student from a class test can cause bias in the overall assess-
ment. Secondly, in contrast to traditional knowledge tracing that
only focuses on individuals, the HKT task requires simultaneously
and effectively modeling learning processes while exploring the
dynamic interactions between individuals and groups during the
learning journey, which is quite confronting.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a unified
Reciprocal approach to trace the Independent and Group Learning
processes (RIGL), aimed at delivering a productive dynamic as-
sessment for both students and groups. Specifically, we first design
a time frame-aware reciprocal embedding module to simultane-
ously model students’ and groups’ response interactions over time
frames and then used the reciprocal enhanced learning modeling to
fully exploit the comprehensive and complementary information
between the two behaviors. Subsequently, we propose a relation-
guided temporal attentive network comprised of dynamic graph
modeling and a temporal self-attentive mechanism for exploring
the dynamic complexity of individual and group interactions during
the learning processes. In particular, the relation-guided dynamic
graph is constructed by mining potential associations between stu-
dents and groups. Finally, a bias-aware contrastive learning module
is introduced to ensure the stability of training. Extensive experi-
ments on four real-world educational datasets clearly demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed RIGL model in the HKT task.

2.1 Knowledge Tracing
Knowledge tracing (KT) [ 3] aims to monitor the changing knowl-
edge states of learners by modeling their exercise-solving sequences
as a sequence prediction task, which has been recognized as an
immensely crucial research task in the field of intelligent education.
Over the past decades, numerous effective KT models have been
proposed. Among these, the traditional KT approaches play an es-
sential role, which usually utilizes probabilistic models [ 3,21,53]
or logistic functions [ 27,28,43] to model the knowledge states of
students. In recent years, the rapid advancements of deep learning
have propelled neural network (NN)-based KT approaches into the
dominant paradigm [ 7,18,25,29,52]. These approaches leverage
the power of neural networks to dynamically mine the knowledge
acquisition process of students by solving the sequence prediction
task, by which performance improvement and personalized edu-
cational experiences are achieved. For instance, DKT [ 29] utilizes
a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the student’s exercis-
ing sequence and represent student cognitive proficiency with the
hidden states. In particular, DKVMN [ 52] introduces the memory-
augmented neural network into KT, which defines two matrices
called keyandvalue to store and update student’s knowledge mas-
tery, respectively. Furthermore, SAKT [ 25] exploits the transformer
architecture [ 39] to explore long-term relations of interaction be-
haviors in students’ learning history for the first time. Despite the
success of these approaches, they primarily focus on individual
assessment and thus leave a gap in the availability of a holistic
4048RIGL: A Unified Reciprocal Approach for Tracing the Independent and Group Learning Processes KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
knowledge tracing framework that simultaneously models individ-
ual and group learning behaviors.
2.2 Dynamic Graph Representation Learning
Dynamic graph representation learning [ 11,51] is a rapidly evolving
field that focuses on effectively capturing temporal dependencies
and changing patterns within dynamic graph-structured data. In
recent years, many approaches have been proposed to effectively
model and learn the structural information and representation of
dynamic graphs in various research problems, such as link predic-
tion [ 30,31,37,55], knowledge retrieval [ 9,10], and career devel-
opment [ 4,32,48,54]. One classical category of approaches is to
conceptualize dynamic graphs by dividing them into multiple graph
snapshots with discrete time characteristics [ 2,26,34]. For example,
DySAT [ 34] employs a dual-dimension self-attention mechanism,
combining structural attention for local node features in graph
snapshots with temporal attention to track graph evolution, en-
hanced by multiple attention heads for diverse graph structure
analysis. EvolveGCN [ 26] introduces a dynamic adaptation of the
graph convolutional network (GCN) model across time, using an
RNN to evolve its parameters and capture the dynamics of graph
sequences, with two different architectures for parameter evolution.
Another avenue of exploration regards time as a continuous
feature, treating the dynamic graph as a stream of timestamped
events to derive node representations [ 33,38,55]. For instance,
DyRep [ 38] is a dynamic graph framework conceptualizing rep-
resentation learning as a latent mediation process bridging two
observed processes namely–dynamics of the network and dynam-
ics on the network, which leverages a two-time scale deep temporal
point process and a temporal-attentive network to intertwine net-
work topology and node activity dynamics. Moreover, dynamic
graph learning are also applied in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS),
e.g., TEGNN [ 15] presents a method that combines a heterogeneous
evolution network with a temporal extension graph neural network
to dynamically model entities and relations [ 4] in the intelligent tu-
toring system. Although these strategies behave well in many tasks,
how to introduce this idea into holistic knowledge tracing, where
the knowledge states of individuals and groups vary dynamically
over time and the associations and influences between them are
difficult to construct and capture directly, has not been explored.
3 Problem Formulation
In this section, we formally define the holistic knowledge trac-
ing (HKT) problem. Let O={𝑜1,...,𝑜𝐼}be the set of 𝐼groups,
S={𝑠1,...,𝑠𝑁}be the set of 𝑁students,E={𝑒1,...,𝑒𝑀}be the
set of𝑀exercises, andC={𝑐1,...,𝑐𝐾}be the set of 𝐾knowl-
edge concepts. The relationship between exercises and concepts
is denoted by 𝑄-matrix𝑄={𝑞𝑖𝑗}𝑀×𝐾, where𝑞𝑖𝑗=1if exercise
𝑒𝑖requires concept 𝑐𝑗and0otherwise. Each group consists of a
certain number of students, e.g., the 𝑖-th group𝑜𝑖={𝑠𝑖
1,...,𝑠𝑖
|𝑜𝑖|},
where𝑠𝑖∗∈Sand|𝑜𝑖|is the size of group 𝑜𝑖.
Generally, students perform personalized learning activities un-
der time frames, i.e., answering a certain number of exercises
at specific time intervals. We denote the whole interaction se-
quence of a student with 𝑇time frames asRS={F1,...,F𝑇},
whereF𝑡={(𝑒𝑡
1,𝑐𝑡
1,𝑟𝑡
1),...,(𝑒𝑡
|F𝑡|,𝑐𝑡
|F𝑡|,𝑟𝑡
|F𝑡|)}stands for the in-
teraction sequence under 𝑡-th time frame; the triple (𝑒𝑡
𝑖,𝑐𝑡
𝑖,𝑟𝑡
𝑖)refers𝑖-th exercising record; 𝑒𝑡
𝑖∈ E is the exercise; 𝑐𝑡
𝑖∈ C is
the concept associated with the exercise 𝑒𝑡
𝑖, which is obtained
from the𝑄; and𝑟𝑡
𝑖∈{0,1}is the response score. Meanwhile, stu-
dents would engage in collective learning behaviors under time
frames, where all students in the group completed the same batch
of exercises. We denote the whole group interaction sequence
for a group with 𝑇time frames asRO={H1,...,H𝑇}, where
H𝑡={(𝑒𝑡
1,𝑐𝑡
1,𝑦𝑡
1),...,(𝑒𝑡
|H𝑡|,𝑐𝑡
|H𝑡|,𝑦𝑡
|H𝑡|)}is the group-exercise
interaction sequence under 𝑡-th time frame; the triple (𝑒𝑡
𝑖,𝑐𝑡
𝑖,𝑦𝑡
𝑖)
denotes𝑖-th interaction log; 𝑒𝑡
𝑖∈E,𝑐𝑡
𝑖∈Cand𝑦𝑡
𝑖∈[0,1]is the
correct rate that the group got.
Problem Definition. Given student’s interaction sequence RS=
{F1,...,F𝑇}, whereF𝑡={(𝑒𝑡
1,𝑐𝑡
1,𝑟𝑡
1),...,(𝑒𝑡
|F𝑡|,𝑐𝑡
|F𝑡|,𝑟𝑡
|F𝑡|)}and
group’s interaction sequence RO={H1,...,H𝑇}, whereH𝑡=
{(𝑒𝑡
1,𝑐𝑡
1,𝑦𝑡
1),...,(𝑒𝑡
|H𝑡|,𝑐𝑡
|H𝑡|,𝑦𝑡
|H𝑡|)}, the goal of holistic knowledge
tracing is twofold: (1) simultaneously diagnosing the knowledge state
of each student within a group and the group-level proficiency of the
corresponding group from time frame 𝑡1to𝑡𝑇; and (2) simultane-
ously predicting students’ performance scores as well as the group’s
correct rate on specific exercises at time frame 𝑡𝑇+1.Notably, unlike
traditional KT task, the interaction elements (e.g., (𝑒𝑡
𝑖,𝑐𝑡
𝑖,𝑦𝑡
𝑖)∈F𝑡)
under each current time frame in the HKT task are not used for
prediction to avoid information leakage.
4 Methodology
In this section, we present the RIGL model in detail. As illustrated in
Figure 2, the architecture of RIGL mainly consists of three compo-
nents, which are a time frame-aware reciprocal embedding module,
a relation-guided temporal attentive network, and a contrastive
learning module.
4.1 Time Frame-Aware Reciprocal Embedding
Module
Effectively representing student interaction and modeling knowl-
edge acquisition during the learning process has always been very
critical in traditional knowledge tracing task [ 36]. Similarly, to ef-
fectively model the learning process of students and groups under
each time frame in the HKT task, we carefully design three sub-
modules: the individual interaction modeling, the group interaction
modeling, and the reciprocal enhanced learning module, which are
detailed in the following.
4.1.1 Individual Interaction Modeling. As mentioned earlier, each
student typically solves multiple exercises under each time frame
F𝑡. Each interaction behavior (𝑒𝑡
𝑖,𝑐𝑡
𝑖,𝑟𝑡
𝑖)contains the interactive
exercises, the involved knowledge concept, and the corresponding
response, which are often rich in information [ 7]. We first encode
the question and response for each student interaction 𝑖, as follows:
x𝑡
𝑖=[e𝑡
𝑖⊕c𝑡
𝑖] W 1+b1;z𝑡
𝑖=r𝑡
𝑖, (1)
where e𝑡
𝑖∈R𝑑𝑒,c𝑡
𝑖∈R𝑑𝑐, and r𝑡
𝑖∈R𝑑𝑟denote the latent represen-
tations of𝑒𝑡
𝑖,𝑐𝑡
𝑖, and𝑟𝑡
𝑖respectively, W1∈R𝑑𝑒×𝑑andb1∈R𝑑are
the trainable parameters, and ⊕refers to the element-wise addition
operator. Notably, 𝑑𝑒,𝑑𝑐, and𝑑𝑟are the dimensions of the embed-
dings of exercise, concept, and response respectively, and here 𝑑𝑒
equals to𝑑𝑐.

includes both individual and group interaction modeling as well as reciprocal enhanced learning. (b) The relation-guided
temporal attentive network models the complex learning processes with dynamic changing knowledge, including the relation-
guided dynamic graph modeling and a temporal self-attentive network. (c) The contrastive learning module generates the
augmented student interactions by randomly flipping responses considering the learning bias during exercise solving, such as
carelessness or guessing, and promotes the training stability through this bias-aware contrastive learning. Best viewed in color.
After the student interaction encoding, we obtain a set of exercise
encoding x𝑡={x𝑡
1,x𝑡
2,..., x𝑡
|F𝑡|}and a set of response encoding
z𝑡={z𝑡
1,z𝑡
2,..., z𝑡
|F𝑡|}under the time frame F𝑡. Considering that a
student’s capability is usually stable over a short period of time [ 35],
we utilize all of the student’s exercising behaviors under a time
frame to comprehensively model her knowledge acquisition. Specif-
ically, we leverage the average pooling operation as a knowledge
aggregator [ 35] to fuse all interactions thereby perceiving knowl-
edge gain during student learning as below:
x𝑠
𝑡=1
|F𝑡||F𝑡|∑︁
𝑖=1x𝑡
𝑖;z𝑠
𝑡=1
|F𝑡||F𝑡|∑︁
𝑖=1z𝑡
𝑖, (2)
where x𝑠
𝑡∈R𝑑andz𝑠
𝑡∈R𝑑denote the knowledge representation
and the performance representation of student 𝑠under𝑡-th time
frame, respectively.
4.1.2 Group Interaction Modeling. Similar to the exercise-solving
process of students, there will be multiple group-exercise interac-
tion records under one time window. Given any one interaction
(𝑒𝑡
𝑖,𝑐𝑡
𝑖,𝑦𝑡
𝑖)under the𝑡-th time frameH𝑡of group𝑜, it consists of
the question, the concept, and the percentage of correct responses.
We first encode the exercise traits and the collective response infor-
mation:
ˆx𝑡
𝑖=[e𝑡
𝑖⊕c𝑡
𝑖] W 2+b2;ˆz𝑡
𝑖=𝑦𝑡
𝑖h1+𝑏1, (3)
where e𝑡
𝑖∈R𝑑𝑒andc𝑡
𝑖∈R𝑑𝑐refer to the embeddings of 𝑒𝑡
𝑖and
𝑐𝑡
𝑖respectively, W2∈R𝑑𝑒×𝑑,b2∈R𝑑,h1∈R, and𝑏1∈Rare
the trainable parameters. Note that we set the new parameters
W2andb2different from Eq. 1 to model the question embeddings
under the perspective of the student group. After acquiring the
group interaction encoding sets ˆx𝑡={ˆx𝑡
1,ˆx𝑡
2,..., ˆx𝑡
|H𝑡|}andˆz𝑡={ˆz𝑡
1,ˆz𝑡
2,..., ˆz𝑡
|H𝑡|}, we further model the learning evolution of group
level within the time frame, similar to Eq.(2):
x𝑜
𝑡=1
|H𝑡||H𝑡|∑︁
𝑖=1ˆx𝑡
𝑖;z𝑜
𝑡=1
|H𝑡||H𝑡|∑︁
𝑖=1ˆz𝑡
𝑖. (4)
4.1.3 Reciprocal Enhanced Learning. Individual and group learn-
ing are always interrelated and complementary in organizations
(e.g., classes, teams [ 14]), where the collective activities in which
students participate contribute to the complementation of the stu-
dents’ knowledge proficiency, as well as the individualized learning
history of the students promotes the perception of the group-level
ability [ 8,20]. Inspired by this, we propose a reciprocal enhanced
learning module for tracing individual and group interaction si-
multaneously (as shown in Figure 2(a)). Specifically, we first utilize
group interaction information to enrich individual learning fea-
tures:
ex𝑠
𝑡=x𝑠
𝑡⊕x𝑜
𝑡;ez𝑠
𝑡=z𝑠
𝑡⊕z𝑜
𝑡, (5)
whereex𝑠
𝑡,ez𝑠
𝑡∈R𝑑stand for the enhanced student interaction encod-
ing. As well, we utilize personalized learning behaviors of students
within the same group to enhance the modeling of group-level learn-
ing interaction. In particular, to address the challenge of individual
absence in collective interaction, we elaborate an absence-perceived
attention aggregation module:
ex𝑜
𝑡=x𝑜
𝑡⊕|𝑜|∑︁
𝑖=1𝜆𝑖x𝑠𝑖
𝑡;ez𝑜
𝑡=z𝑜
𝑡⊕|𝑜|∑︁
𝑖=1𝜆𝑖z𝑠𝑖

where x𝑠𝑖

𝑡∈R𝑑are the interaction features of 𝑖-th student 𝑠𝑖
within group 𝑜, and𝜆𝑖denotes the absence-perceived contribution

𝜆𝑖=𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(ˆ𝜆𝑖)=𝑒𝑥𝑝(ˆ𝜆𝑖)

where W𝑘,W𝑞∈R2𝑑×𝑑are the key and query matrices of the
attention layer, h2∈R𝑑is the weight vector for projecting attention
scores, and𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(·)and[·;·]denote the softmax function and
the concatenation operation.
4.2 Relation-Guided Temporal Attentive
Network
Considering the dynamic complexity of the learning process of
students and groups and the information interaction between them,
in this section, we propose a relation-guided temporal attentive
network to model this complex learning process with dynamic
changing knowledge, which consists of the relation-guided dynamic
graph modeling and a temporal self-attentive network.
4.2.1 Relation-Guided Dynamic Graph Modeling. In this section,
we first describe how to construct the relation-guided dynamic
graph and then design a dynamic GCN module to enhance the
relation modeling. Referring to previous work [ 34], we consider the
global dynamic graph as a series of static graph snapshots, i.e., G=
{G1,G2,...,G𝑇}, where𝑇is the number of time frames. For time
frame𝑡∈𝑇, with respect to the personalized learning behaviors
of the students in the group 𝑜∈O and the interactive response
behaviors of the group, we construct the corresponding group-
individual graphG𝑜
𝑡=(𝑉,𝐸𝑡)with a node set 𝑉={𝑜,𝑠1,...,𝑠|𝑜|}
and a edge set 𝐸𝑡=(𝐸𝑜↔𝑠,𝐸𝑡𝑠↔𝑠), where𝐸𝑜↔𝑠denotes the set of
edges connecting the group node 𝑜and all other student nodes, and
𝐸𝑡𝑠↔𝑠denotes the set of connecting edges between students under
time stage𝑡, which is dynamically changing.
Specifically, a relation-guided approach is proposed to construct
the changing edges between students. We first incorporate the
above interaction encoding as node feature:
v𝑡
0=[ex𝑜
𝑡;ez𝑜
𝑡];v𝑡
𝑖=[ex𝑠𝑖
𝑡;ez𝑠𝑖
𝑡],𝑖∈{1,2,...,|𝑜|}, (8)
where v𝑡
0,v𝑡
𝑖∈R2𝑑denote the feature vector of group node and
student nodes respectively. Then, we obtain the node feature matrix
V𝑡∈R(|𝑜|+1)×2𝑑. For any two student nodes v𝑡
𝑖andv𝑡
𝑗in the time
frame𝑡, where𝑖,𝑗∈{1,2,...,|𝑜|}, we acquire the relation distance
by calculate the exercise interaction similarity between them and
then obtain the relation matrix as follows:
D𝑡=[𝑑v𝑡
𝑖,v𝑡
𝑗]1≤𝑖,𝑗≤|𝑜|,
𝑑v𝑡
𝑖,v𝑡
𝑗=𝑠𝑖𝑚(v𝑡
𝑖,v𝑡
𝑗),(9)
where D𝑡∈R|𝑜|×|𝑜|denotes the relation matrix, and 𝑠𝑖𝑚(·)stands
for similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity). Subsequently, for
any student node v𝑡
𝑖, we select top-k other student nodes with the
highest potential associations to construct its first-order neighbors
according to D𝑡
𝑖,𝑗,𝑗∈{1,...,|𝑜|}\{𝑖}, and then we can get the
adjacency matrix A𝑡∈ {0,1}(|𝑜|+1)×(|𝑜|+1), which includes the
connectivity between group node and student node, as shown in
upper part of Figure 2(b).After the construction of G𝑜, we design a dynamic GCN module
composed of static GCN units to effectively model the deeper asso-
ciations between group and student as well as student and student
by introducing the GCN layers [ 12]. Given the node feature matrix
V𝑡and the adjacency matrix A𝑡, the𝑙-layer GCN of the unit under
the𝑡-th time frame is defined as:
V𝑡
(𝑙+1)=𝛼(ˆA𝑡V𝑡
(𝑙)W𝑡
(𝑙)+b𝑡
(𝑙)), (10)
where V𝑡
0=V𝑡,W𝑡
(𝑙)∈R𝑑𝑙×𝑑𝑙+1,b𝑡
(𝑙)∈R𝑑𝑙are trainable param-
eters,𝑑𝑙denotes the output node feature dimension for 𝑙-th layer
and𝑑0=2𝑑,𝛼(·)stands for the non-linear activation function (e.g.,
ReLU), and ˆA𝑡=(˜U𝑡)−1
2˜A𝑡(˜U𝑡)−1
2)is the normalized symmetric
adjacency matrix. Here, ˜A𝑡=A𝑡+I|𝑜|+1, and ˜U𝑡is the degree
matrix. I|𝑜|+1denotes an identity matrix with dimensions of |𝑜|+1
and ˜U𝑡
𝑖𝑖=Í
𝑗A𝑡
𝑖𝑗.
4.2.2 Temporal Self-Attentive Network. To more effectively capture
the intricate temporal effects in the overall abilities and knowledge
states of groups and individual students during the learning process,
we introduce a temporal self-attentive network in this section. Fol-
lowing previous work [ 7,18], we define the temporal self-attention
module and obtain the retrieved knowledge states of the group and
student (i.e., the selection of Q,K,Vparameters is essentially a
knowledge retriever) as follows:
 
h𝑜
𝑡+1=𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑓𝐴𝑡𝑡(Q𝑜,K𝑜,V𝑜),
Q𝑜=m𝑡+1
0,K𝑜={m1

0,..., n𝑡
0};
h𝑠𝑖
𝑡+1=𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑓𝐴𝑡𝑡(Q𝑠𝑖,K𝑠𝑖,V𝑠𝑖),
Q𝑠𝑖=m𝑡+1
𝑖,K𝑠𝑖={m1

where m𝑡

(𝐿)[𝑖,:𝑑],n𝑡
𝑖=

(𝐿)[𝑖,𝑑:]∈R𝑑,1≤𝑖≤|𝑜|are the interaction features of group
𝑜and student 𝑠𝑖extracted from the learned 𝐿-th layer node rep-
resentations, 𝑑=𝑑𝐿
2is the dimension size of final representation
and𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑓𝐴𝑡𝑡(·)denotes the Self-Attention module. Notably, similar
to AKT [ 7], we can only model current interaction with visible
historical learning behaviors to prevent information leakage (as
shown in the lower part of Figure 2(b)).
Finally, we construct a readout module consisting of a two-layer
fully connected network for the next time frame performance pre-
diction of the group and student (as shown in part (1) of Figure 2(c)).
Specifically:(ˆ𝑦𝑖,𝑡+1=𝑀𝐿𝑃𝑂([h𝑜
𝑡+1;e𝑡+1
𝑖]),
ˆ𝑟𝑖,𝑡+1=𝑀𝐿𝑃𝑆([h𝑠
𝑡+1;e𝑡+1
𝑖]),(12)
where ˆ𝑦𝑖,𝑡+1andˆ𝑟𝑖,𝑡+1denote the predicted responses of group 𝑜
and student 𝑠on𝑖-th exercise e𝑡+1
𝑖under𝑡+1-th time frame, and
𝑀𝐿𝑃𝑂and𝑀𝐿𝑃𝑆are two MLP networks.
4.3 Model Optimization
In this section, we describe the model training and parameter op-
timization. In particular, we design a contrastive learning module
in order to ensure the stability of the training process and the
effectiveness of the learning of representations.
4.3.1 Contrastive Learning Module. Inspired by [ 13,49], we argue
that a learner may have response biases, such as careless responses
or guessing responses, when performing questions over a period of
4051KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Xiaoshan Yu et al.
time. Along this line, we design a bias-aware contrastive learning
module for learning robust representations. Specifically, as shown
in part (2) of Figure 2(c), we randomly flip students’ responses in the
time frames to generate the augmented interactions, and intuitively,
the augmented student state should remain similar to the original.
Following previous work [ 49], we calculate contrastive loss from a
single batch:
L𝐶𝐿
𝑠𝑖,𝑡=−𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑠𝑖𝑚(h𝑠𝑖
𝑡,h𝑠𝑖+
𝑡)/𝜏)
Í
𝑗≠𝑖𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑠𝑖𝑚(h𝑠𝑖
𝑡,h𝑠𝑗+
𝑡)/𝜏), (13)
where h𝑠𝑖+
𝑡denotes the augmented student state of student 𝑠𝑖under
the𝑡-th time frame, 𝜏is a temperature parameter (here set as 0.05),
and𝑠𝑖𝑚(·)stands for the similarity function.
4.3.2 Loss Function. In the training phase, we jointly evaluate
the model performance by predicting the interaction of both the
group- and student-exercise responses. Specifically, for each student
𝑠within group 𝑜, we utilize the cross-entropy loss function for the
student performance prediction:
L𝑠𝑡𝑢
𝑜=−∑︁
𝑠∑︁
𝑡∑︁
𝑖𝑟𝑠
𝑖,𝑡logˆ𝑟𝑠
𝑖,𝑡−(1−𝑟𝑠
𝑖,𝑡)log(1−ˆ𝑟𝑠
𝑖,𝑡).(14)
Then, we choose the mean square error loss (MSE) function for the
group-exercise interaction prediction:
L𝑔𝑟𝑝
𝑜=∑︁
𝑡∑︁
𝑖(ˆ𝑦𝑜
𝑖,𝑡−𝑦𝑜
𝑖,𝑡)2.(15)
Meanwhile, we calculate the contrastive loss of all students in the
group𝑜according to Eq.(13):
L𝐶𝐿
𝑜=∑︁
𝑠∑︁
𝑡L𝐶𝐿
𝑠,𝑡.(16)
Finally, we obtain the complete optimization objective function
based on the above three loss objectives:
L𝑜=L𝑔𝑟𝑝
𝑜+1
|𝑜|L𝑠𝑡𝑢
𝑜+𝛾·L𝐶𝐿
𝑜. (17)
where𝛾is the weight coefficient to control the influence of con-
trastive signals. We can then train the whole model and optimize
the model parameters utilizing gradient descent.
5 Experiments
In this section, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
education datasets aiming at verifying the effectiveness and superi-
ority of our proposed RIGL model. Specifically, we will answer the
following research questions (RQs) to unfold the experiments:
•RQ1: What about the effectiveness and superiority of the pro-
posed RIGL model on the holistic knowledge tracing task?
•RQ2: Do the designed key components benefit our proposed
RIGL model in achieving performance improvement?
•RQ3: How do the hyper-parameter settings influence the holistic
knowledge tracing performance of the RIGL model?
•RQ4: How does RIGL facilitate tracing the evolution of knowl-
edge states in both individuals and groups and how does it help
to understand the progression of their relationships over time?
5.1 Experimental Setting
5.1.1 Datasets. We conduct experiments on four real-world edu-
cation datasets with diversity to evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed RIGL on the holistic tracing task, which are ASSIST12 [ 5],Table 1: The statistics of all datasets.

the group labels (i.e., the class to which the students belong), and
students from the same group share the same label category. Table 1
shows the statistics of the datasets, and more details of the dataset
description and data preprocessing are available in Appendix A.2.
5.1.2 Baseline Approaches. The performance of RIGL is com-
pared with eight strong and commonly used baselines including
DKT [ 29], SAKT [ 25], AKT [ 7], LPKT [ 36], GIKT [ 47], simpleKT [ 18],
AT-DKT [ 17] and DTransformer [ 49]. Notably, these baselines are
individual-based knowledge tracing models, so we adapt them on
the HKT task. The introduction and implementation details can be
found in Appendix A.3.
5.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. To comprehensively evaluate the per-
formance of all methods on holistic knowledge tracing, we adopt
four evaluation metrics, including the area under the ROC curve
(AUC), accuracy (ACC), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean
absolute error (MAE). Specifically, the AUC and ACC are used to
evaluate the individual-level performance prediction, and RMSE
and MAE for the group-level performance on future exercises.
5.1.4 Parameter Settings. We performed 5-fold cross-validation
in the experiments. For each fold, 80% of samples are set as for
the training data, and others are for the test set. We implemented
all methods with PyTorch by Python. The dimension size of em-
beddings (i.e., 𝑑𝑒,𝑑𝑐,𝑑𝑟) was set as 256. The number of the GCN
layers𝐿1was set to 2, where each layer’s hidden size is 256, and
the number of self-attentive network layers 𝐿2is set to 4. We used
the Adam optimizer, where the learning rate was searched in [1e-4,
5e-4, 1e-3, 2e-3, 1e-2]. The coefficient 𝛾of contrastive loss was set to
0.01. We adopted the cosine similarity as the similarity calculation
function𝑠𝑖𝑚(·)(Eq.9 and Eq.13).
5.2 Performance Comparison (RQ1)
Table 2 shows the performance of the proposed RIGL including
individual-level and group-level compared with the baseline models
on the four datasets. We highlighted the best results of all mod-
els in boldface and underlined the suboptimal results. According
to the results, there are several observations: (1) Our RIGL model
demonstrates significant improvements over the baselines across
all datasets. Specifically, it shows an average increase of 4.01% and
20.32% over the best baseline model at both the individual and
group levels, respectively, which underscores the effectiveness of
the RIGL. Especially, in comparison to the runner-up method on
the SLP-Bio dataset, our model achieves an average of 5.83% and
31.59% performance improvements in terms of individual-level and
group-level. (2) RIGL generally has a higher percentage of increased
performance in terms of the group-level than the individual-level,
demonstrating that personalized learning information is highly

effective and has a more pronounced impact on the group-level di-
agnosis during the reciprocal learning modeling. (3) In the baseline
methods, the DTransformer and LPKT models exhibit relatively
better performance compared to other baselines. This phenomenon
may be attributed to the gains from modeling forgetting behav-
iors in both group and individual learning processes in those two
models.
In particular, we also conducted experiments for baselines’ indi-
vidual version (i.e., traditional knowledge tracing model) utilizing
only individual interaction data and present the results of LPKT-Ind
and simpleKT-Ind in Table 2 (the complete results can be found in
Appendix A.4). As can be observed from the results, our RIGL re-
mains significantly superior in terms of individual-level proficiency
assessment. Specifically, it shows an average increase of 5.91% and3.48% over the best individual knowledge tracing baseline in terms
of AUC and ACC metrics, respectively, which demonstrates the
contribution of group learning behaviors to the modeling of inde-
pendent learning, and the effectiveness of the proposed reciprocal
learning modeling in our RIGL model. In addition, some of the base-
line models are less effective at the individual-level than modeling
the individual alone, suggesting that simple joint training may not
always work, and this is further evidence of the validity of RIGL.
An interesting phenomenon is that the advantage of RIGL over the
KTM-ind model behaves differently on different datasets, which
may be caused by the characteristics of the dataset. Since the RIGL
model requires tracing both individual and group ability changes,
its performance suffers when the group-exercise interactions are
relatively sparse in the dataset. Whereas KTM-ind (e.g., LPKT-ind)

as the primitive individual KT model is unable to model group
interactions (focusing on individual level modeling) and thus is less
affected by this sparsity.
5.3 Ablation Study (RQ2)
To answer RQ2, we first conducted a comprehensive ablation study
to investigate the impact of each module in the RIGL model by defin-
ing the following variations: 1) w/o Att: removing the absence-
perceived attention aggregation module in reciprocal enhanced
learning; 2) w/o RL: removing the reciprocal enhanced learning
module; 3) w/o DG: removing the dynamic graph modeling; 4) w/o
CL: removing the contrastive loss. As illustrated in Figure 3, the
results reveal insightful observations: (1) In comparison to RIGL, all
variants suffer relative performance degradation on four datasets
across various evaluation metrics, demonstrating the contribution
of the designed submodules to our proposed model. (2) The most
significant decrease in the model performance occurs after remov-
ing the reciprocal enhanced learning module, which exhibits that
jointly and interactively modeling the reciprocal learning process
of students and groups plays a crucial role in the HKT task, and
also confirms the soundness of our designed model. (3) The per-
formance degradation of removing the dynamic graph modeling
module is also quite noticeable, reflecting the fact that dynamic
graph modeling is important for capturing the evolving knowledge
states of groups and individuals.
In addition, we further conducted an ablation study to investi-
gate the effect brought by reciprocal learning on the performance
of holistic knowledge tracing by disassembling the reciprocal en-
hanced learning module in RIGL. Specifically, we removed the

individual-level features, the group-level features, and both features
in the reciprocal enhanced learning module (i.e., w/o Ind, w/o Grp,
andw/o Dual), respectively, and then inspected the performance
variations. Notably, the experiments in this section are completed
by removing the features of individual and group interactions in
the reciprocal module, respectively, within the framework of HKT,
which requires that the ablated RIGL is still capable of tracking both
the evolution of individual and group abilities. The experimental
results are shown in Figure 4. We have the following observations:
(1) The absence of individual-level and group-level features brings
about performance degradation, demonstrating the complementary
facilitation of individuals’ and groups’ learning features in the HKT
task. (2) The performance degradation introduced when neither in-
dividual modeling nor group modeling utilizes each other’s features
during the information fusion process is very significant, which is
further evidence of the effectiveness of reciprocal learning.
5.4 Parameter Sensitivity Analysis (RQ3)
To answer RQ3, we conducted a parameter sensitivity analysis in
this section to investigate the effects of hyper-parameters, which
mainly include the learning rate and the weight coefficient 𝛾of the
contrastive loss. Specifically, we set the list of learning rates to be
{1e-4, 5e-4, 1e-3, 2e-3, 1e-2}, as well as the 𝛾values {1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2,
5e-2, 1e-1}, and mainly show the experimental results on the SLP-
Bio dataset. As shown in Figure 5, we observe that 1e-3 is sufficient
for the learning rate, and the performance presents a trend of rising

Figure 6, the model reaches its best performance when the value of
𝛾is 1e-2 and the effect on the AUC metric is not very strong. An
interesting phenomenon here is that the trend of this coefficient’s
impact on the performance of the individual-level and the group-
level is different as the 𝛾value increments, which is perhaps due to
the different modeling effects of the fraction of contrastive loss on
group learning and individual learning behaviors.
5.5 Case Study (RQ4)
5.5.1 Visualization of Proficiency Evolution. To further un-
derstand how RIGL traces the evolution of the individual-level
and group-level knowledge states, in this case study, we demon-
strated the tracing process. Figure 7 illustrates the evolution of
both a learner’s and a group’s knowledge proficiency across five
time frames on four knowledge concepts, as traced by RIGL. From
the visualization, we can observe that the individual’s mastery of
the corresponding concept of the exercise increases even if it is
answered incorrectly, which implies that wrongly responding to the
exercise also brings knowledge gain. In addition, it can be seen that
the knowledge gained from individual learning affects the group’s
knowledge level, yet the degree of impact varies under different
time frames, meaning that the effect of the individual on the group
varies over time, which is in line with the real scenario.
5.5.2 Dynamic Relationship Mining. Specifically, a case study
of relationship observations was conducted to explore the dynamic
relationships between individuals and the group, as well as among
individuals in the holistic knowledge tracing process. Figure 8shows the dynamic relationship graph across the group under five
time frames by presenting the correlation distances (as mentioned
in Section 4.2; for convenience of the display, three students under
one group were selected). It can be observed that the relationships
between students and groups and among students are dynamically
changing (e.g., the increasing similarity of both 𝑠1and𝑜as well as
𝑠1and𝑠3), justifying the exploitation and modeling of potential as-
sociations through our use of the dynamic graph. In addition, based
on the mined latent relationships, potential subgroups within the
group can be effectively identified, which will help us to perceive
the evolution of the internal structure of the group.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced a novel framework termed as RIGL (a
unified Reciprocal approach for Independent and Group Learning
processes), which aims to provide comprehensive and dynamic
modeling for both independent learning and group learning. Our
approach comprises several key components. Initially, we devised
a time frame-aware reciprocal embedding module to concurrently
capture the temporal interactions between students and groups dur-
ing the learning processes, followed by a reciprocal-enhanced learn-
ing mechanism that maximizes the synergistic insights from these
two learning behaviors. To further mine the intricate dynamics of
student-group associations, we proposed a relation-guided tempo-
ral attentive network encompassing dynamic graph modeling and
temporal self-attention mechanisms. Notably, the relation-guided
dynamic graph is formed by uncovering potential links between stu-
dents and groups. Finally, we incorporated a bias-aware contrastive
learning module to ensure model stability during training. Exten-
sive experiments were conducted on four real-world educational
datasets to substantiate the efficacy of our RIGL model, particularly
in addressing the HKT task. We hope this work could lead to further
studies on holistic knowledge tracing.

sequences of the individual and the group based on time period
divisions, where each time frame contains two types of interaction
data, i.e., student-exercise responses and group-exercise responses.
Particularly, for each group-exercise response under each time
frame, we calculated the correct rate of this group of students on
the exercise as the group’s response result. We screened out groups
with fewer than three students and students with less than three
response logs. Due to the different temporal characteristics of the
different datasets, each dataset is not divided over exactly the same
time span, where ASSIST12 and NIPS-Edu are divided in days, and
SLP-Math and SLP-Bio are divided in hours. Finally, since the group-
exercise interactions are very sparse under each time frame in the
raw data, i.e., the number of exercises answered by all students
within the same group is extremely limited, we set a threshold of
0.6 to prevent the group learning sequence from being empty.
A.3 Introduction and Implementation of
Baselines
A.3.1 Baselines. In this paper, we compare RIGL with eight base-
line approaches. The details of all the comparison methods are:
•DKT [29]: DKT is one of the most classical knowledge tracing
methods, which utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) to
model the exercise interaction sequences and mine the cognitive
pattern between learners and exercises.
•SAKT [25]: SAKT is the first knowledge tracing model intro-
ducing the self-attention mechanism [ 39], which exploits the
transformer structure to model long-range dependencies of in-
teraction behaviors in students’ exercising sequences.
•AKT [7]: AKT designs a novel monotonic attention module on
the basis of transformer architecture for effectively modeling the
forgetting behaviors of learners, which leverages an exponential
decay function that can perceive contextual distance information
to learn the attention weights.
•LPKT [36]: LPKT proposes a learning process-consistent model
to explore the consistency of students’ changing knowledge state
during the learning process, which consists of a learning module,
a forgetting module, and a predicting module.
•GIKT [47]: GIKT is a graph-based Interaction model for Knowl-
edge Tracing that leverages a graph convolutional network (GCN)
to effectively integrate question-skill correlations and addresses
the challenge of dispersed relevant questions by consideringquestions and skills as different manifestations of knowledge in
predicting students’ mastery levels.
•simpleKT [18]: simpleKT is a simple but strong baseline method,
which explicitly models the question-specific variations to cap-
ture the individual differences and uses the ordinary dot-product
attention function to mine the time-aware behavior information.
•AT-DKT [17]: AT-DKT is an novel knowledge tracing model
that enhances the original deep knowledge tracing model by
incorporating two auxiliary learning tasks.
•DTransformer [49]: DTransformer introduces a Diagnostic
Transformer with a novel contrastive learning-based training
approach, designed to accurately diagnose and trace learners’
knowledge proficiency.
A.3.2 Implementation. To adapt these baselines that only focus
on individual-level knowledge tracing to the HKT task, we describe
the implementation details. Specifically, for the inputs including in-
dependent learning sequence RSand the group learning sequence
RO, the baseline first encodes their interaction behavior, respec-
tively, i.e.,(𝑒𝑡
𝑖,𝑐𝑡
𝑖,𝑟𝑡
𝑖)and(𝑒𝑡
𝑖,𝑐𝑡
𝑖,𝑦𝑡
𝑖)under each time frame F𝑡and
H𝑡. Subsequently, the baseline performs an average aggregation of
the interaction encodings under each time frame in each of the two
learning sequences. Furthermore, the obtained encoding sequences
are fed into the knowledge tracing module underlying the baseline
for modeling the changing knowledge states of the individual and
group. Finally, a joint loss function, comprising a cross-entropy loss
for predicting students’ performance and a mean square error loss
for predicting the group’s performance, is used to train the model.
A.4 Complete Comparison Results of
Individual-based Baselines
As described in the Section 5.2, we also conducted experiments for
baselines’ individual version (i.e., traditional knowledge tracing
model) utilizing only individual interaction data. The complete
comparison results can are shown in Table S2. It can be observed
that in comparison to baseline models, the proposed RIGL remains
significantly superior. Specifically, it shows an average increase
of 5.91% and 3.48% over the best individual knowledge tracing
baseline in terms of AUC and ACC metrics, respectively, which
demonstrates the contribution of group learning behaviors to the
modeling of independent learning, and the effectiveness of the
proposed reciprocal learning modeling in our RIGL model.
