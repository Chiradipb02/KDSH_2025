Abstract
Automated systems must adapt to evolving environments, yet many
struggle with drift phenomena affecting healthcare, finance, and
cybersecurity domains. The DELTA workshop addresses this by
distinguishing between data and concept drift, aiming to create a
practical, human-centric framework for managing drift. The work-
shop seeks innovative drift detection, prediction, and analysis so-
lutions by uniting researchers and practitioners. DELTA fosters
collaboration to advance the understanding and management of
drift in dynamic data landscapes by featuring keynotes, paper pre-
sentations, interactive sessions, and discussions.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, having automated systems embedded into our everyday
lives is one of the main goals in industry and academia. However,
many automated systems that humans increasingly rely on cannot
adapt to the constant evolution of the modern world. This problem,
also known as drift phenomena, impacts the adoption and the

https://doi.org/10.1145/3637528.3671492efficacy of automated systems in multiple critical domains (e.g.,
medical [ 8], finance, manufacturing, and cybersecurity) and across
different data types (e.g., images, text, etc.). While there has been a
recent focus on the “distribution drift” [ 1,3,6,7,10], this umbrella
term fails to decouple the difference between data drift and concept
drift [ 4,5], causing, in that way, misunderstanding in the researcher
and practitioner communities.
To address this gap, we propose the DELTA workshop to bring
researchers and practitioner communities to uncover the relation-
ships between types of drift and work towards a practical, reality-
informed, and human-centric framework for coping with the mul-
tifaceted definitions of drift in evolving landscapes [ 2,9]. We invite
authors to submit unpublished, original papers to overcome the
challenges of current state-of-the-art techniques - i.e., detection,
prediction, and analysis - in real-world domains [ 6], also from the
perspective of human-centered AI. During the event, we will foster
discussions on drift-related classical problems of automated sys-
tems through a different lens to expose attendees to differences
between data, concept, and hybrid drift. Then, to take steps to-
wards interactive discussions around the topics of this workshop,
we feature a moderated verbal duel session, where researchers with
different approaches discuss their choices in a debate-like fashion,
which will encourage constructive feedback between the audience
and the duelists.
2 Workshop Topics
DELTA welcomes contributions on all topics related to drift in
evolving landscapes across domains (e.g., finance, business, basic
sciences, construction computational advertising, IoT, etc.) and inde-
pendent of data types (e.g., networks, tabular, unstructured, graphs,
logs, spatiotemporal, multimedia, time series, genomic sequences,
and streaming data.). Contributions can also include research or
perspectives regarding the following:
•Frameworks:
–Online and Incremental Learning
–(Self-)Adaptive Systems
–Human-in-the-Loop Learning
•Topics:
–Uncertainty Quantification for Drift Learning
–Drift Detection, Prediction, and Analysis
–Process Mining for evolving environments
–Process Drift Analysis
