ABSTRACT
In today’s competitive and fast-evolving business environment, it is
a critical time for organizations to rethink how to deal with talent
and management-related tasks in a quantitative manner. Indeed,
thanks to the era of big data, the availability of large-scale talent
data provides unparalleled opportunities for business leaders to
understand the rules of talent and management, which in turn de-
liver intelligence for effective decision-making and management for
their organizations. In the past few years, talent and management
computing have increasingly attracted attention from KDD commu-
nities, and a number of research/applied data science efforts have
been devoted. To this end, the purpose of this workshop, i.e., the 5th
International Workshop on Talent and Management Computing
(TMC’2024), is to bring together researchers and practitioners to
discuss both the critical problems faced by talent and management-
related domains and potential data-driven solutions by leveraging
state-of-the-art data mining technologies.
KEYWORDS
Talent behavior modeling, professional social networks, group
based decision making, strategic management

1 INTRODUCTION
Talent and management computing is an emerging research topic in
data mining. Indeed, they have increasingly attracted attention from
both academia and industry in previous KDD and relevant confer-
ences [ 11]. For example, in the past years, many papers have been
published in relevant topics, including talent recruitment [ 2,12,

https://doi.org/10.1145/3637528.367147915,17,18], personalized job recommendation [ 6,13,14,21,22,28],
talent development [ 20], organizational analysis [ 23], talent career
analysis [ 5,10,25], business competition analysis [ 1,7,9,24], labor
market intelligence [ 4,8,16,19,26,27], and fairness-related top-
ics [3]. Along this line, there still exist numerous open problems and
challenges to be addressed, especially in terms of how to leverage
data mining techniques for talent and management-related tasks,
such as performance evaluation, talent retention, talent develop-
ment, recruitment analytics, team management, and organizational
stability analysis. Especially, with the COVID-19 pandemic, AI assis-
tance is now urgently required to benefit enterprises by enhancing
their management efficiency. Meanwhile, we realize that most prior
arts mentioned above obtained increasing citations in the past five
years, which proves that the AI-enhanced talent service has become
a hot topic for both industry and academia.
In the past six years, we successfully organized five workshops
(OBTA-2018, TMC-2019/2020/2021/2023) and attracted at least 500
attendees. Based on the above, we believe this workshop is strongly
relevant to KDD-2024, which is a global event for bringing together
researchers, practitioners, innovators, decision-makers, and busi-
ness experts working in the field of data mining.
2 TOPICS OF INTEREST
This workshop aims to bring together leading researchers and prac-
titioners to exchange and share their experiences and the latest
research/application results on all aspects of Talent and Manage-
ment Computing based on data mining technologies. It will provide
a premier interdisciplinary forum to discuss the most recent trends,
innovations, applications as well as the real-world challenges en-
countered and corresponding data-driven solutions in relevant do-
mains. The topics of interest include but are not limited to: online
recruitment, job recommendation, person-job fit and job satisfac-
tion, career development, career path modeling, professional social
networks, talent behavior modeling, talent personality and lead-
ership, talent retention and incentive, team formation and task
assignment, group-based decision-making, organizational change
and stability, organizational culture and communication, organi-
zational competition analysis, labor market intelligence, strategic
management and planning, fairness in talent and management
computing, and LLM-based talent management system.

3 TARGET AUDIENCE
The target audience includes researchers and professionals in the
fields of Applied Data Science, Computational Social Science, People
Analytics, Management Information Systems, Business Intelligence,
Organizational Behavior Modeling and related areas. The workshop
also aims to attract researchers and practitioners from industry com-
munities, since it covers research/applied data science efforts for
the development of applications in fields such as talent recruitment,
talent development, professional social networks, management in-
formation systems, and organizational management.
