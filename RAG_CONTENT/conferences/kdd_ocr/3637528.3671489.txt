ABSTRACT
Time series data has become ubiquitous across various fields such
as healthcare, finance, entertainment, and transportation, driven
by advancements in sensing technologies that enable continuous
monitoring and recording. This growth in data size and complexity
presents new challenges for traditional analysis techniques, neces-
sitating the development of advanced, interdisciplinary temporal
mining algorithms. The goals of this workshop are to: (1) high-
light significant challenges in learning and mining from time series
data, such as irregular sampling, spatiotemporal structures, and
uncertainty quantification; (2) discuss recent developments in algo-
rithmic, theoretical, statistical, and systems-based approaches for
addressing these challenges, including both classical methods and
large language models (LLMs); and (3) synergize research efforts
by exploring both new and open problems in time series analysis
and mining. This workshop will focus on both the theoretical and
practical aspects of time series data analysis, providing a platform
for researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and
industry to discuss potential research directions, critical technical
issues, and present solutions for practical applications. Contribu-
tions from related fields such as AI, machine learning, data science,
and statistics are also included.

1 INTRODUCTION
Time series analysis has attracted innovative approaches from vari-
ous disciplines, including data mining, artificial intelligence, ma-
chine learning, statistical learning, and the physical sciences. This
interdisciplinary nature has led to wide-ranging applications and
significant impact, making it an ideal subject for sharing new ideas
at the SIGKDD conference. The SIGKDD Workshop on Mining and
Learning from Time Series (MiLeTS) has been the only dedicated
workshop on time series mining at the last eight KDD conferences.
Following the success of the first eight SIGKDD Workshops on
MiLeTS held from 2015 to 2023, the latest, the ninth in the se-
ries, was held in Washington, D.C., at SIGKDD 2023. This work-
shop was highly successful and brought together researchers from
academia and industry who praised its effective synergy in address-
ing the challenges posed by large, complex time series. SIGKDD
2024 presents an opportune time and venue to continue hosting this
multidisciplinary workshop on ubiquitous temporal data mining.
2 OBJECTIVE AND TOPICS OF INTERESTS
The explosion of new sensing technologies (wearable sensors, satel-
lites, mobile phones, etc.), combined with increasingly cheap and
effective storage, is generating an unprecedented and growing
amount of time series data in a variety of domains. The volume and
complexity of these data present new and significant challenges
to existing and even state-of-the-art methods. The focus of this
workshop is to synergize the research in this area and discuss both
new and open problems in time series analysis and mining. The so-
lutions to these problems may be algorithmic, theoretical, statistical,
or systems-based in nature. Further, we will emphasize applications
to high impact or relatively new domains, including but not limited
to biology, health and medicine, climate and weather, road traffic,
astronomy, cloud computing, and energy.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
•Time series pattern mining, discovery, and detection.
•Multivariate time series that are high-dimensional, have hetero-
geneous variables, or other atypical properties.
•Time series with special structure: spatiotemporal (e.g., wind and
traffic patterns at different locations), relational (e.g., patients
with similar diseases), hierarchical, etc.
•Time series with sparse or irregular sampling, non-random miss-
ing values, and special types of measurement noise or bias.
•Time series analysis using less traditional approaches, such as
deep learning and subspace clustering.
•Applications to high impact or relatively new time series domains,
such as health and medicine, road traffic, seismology, AIOps,
AIIoT, and air quality.
In addition to soliciting traditional Research Track papers on
the above or related topics, we also plan to solicit one additional
type of paper describing open problems. Papers of this type need
not propose a new method but rather describe and analyze a new
or open time series problem that poses significant challenges to
current techniques. Such papers need not solve the problem but
should provide a clear, detailed description and analysis and a
thorough empirical investigation demonstrating that state-of-the-
art methods are insufficient.
Reviewing: The review process is single-round and double-blind.
Accepted papers will be presented as posters during the workshop
and list on the website1(non-archival/without proceedings). Be-
sides, a small number of accepted papers will be selected to be
presented as contributed talks.
3 WORKSHOP FORMAT AND SCHEDULE
The schedule for the workshop will include the following key ele-
ments:
•Presentation Sessions: The presentations will take place from
9:00 AM to 1:00 PM, divided into two sessions. There will be a
break between the sessions to allow ample time for discussion
and networking.
•Keynote Presentations: Invited keynote presentations, each last-
ing 30-45 minutes, will be delivered by esteemed experts in time
series analysis from both academia and industry.
•Oral Presentations: Each accepted oral submission will be allo-
cated 10 minutes for the presentation, followed by a Q&A session.
•Poster Session: If there is sufficient interest, we may add an extra
session for demonstrations or posters during the break. Each
accepted paper will have the opportunity to either present a
demonstration or showcase their work as a poster in this session.
•Panel Discussion: The final session will feature a panel discus-
sion on current and future topics in large-scale time series analy-
sis. Panelists from academia, federal agencies, and industry will
provide diverse perspectives on the discussion.
These elements are designed to create a comprehensive and engag-
ing program that promotes interaction, knowledge sharing, and
collaboration among participants.

This workshop will have broad appeal to a wide range of researchers
who fall into two general categories. The first includes methodolo-
gists who design algorithms and models for analyzing and mining
time series. These folks hail from various backgrounds, from sig-
nal processing to data mining to Bayesian statistics. A workshop
focused on problems (rather than a specific set of solutions and
tools) will be of great interest to them. The second group includes
researchers from the application domains (e.g., health, climate, traf-
fic, mobile video, cloud computing, etc.) that generate big, complex
time series data. Many of these researchers perceive the potential
value in these rich data but struggle to successfully analyze their
data. This workshop will present them with an opportunity to learn
more about the state-of-the-art and to build bridges to and collab-
orations with methodologists. The panel discussion will focus on
open problems in both methodologies and applications and will be
beneficial to student researchers who are looking for dissertation
topics and expert advice.
