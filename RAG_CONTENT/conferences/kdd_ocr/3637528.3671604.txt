ABSTRACT
With recent rapid growth in online shopping, AI-powered Engage-
ment Surfaces (ES) have become ubiquitous across retail services.
These engagement surfaces perform an increasing range of func-
tions, including recommending new products for purchase, remind-
ing customers of their orders and providing delivery notifications.
Understanding the causal effect of engagement surfaces on value
driven for customers and businesses remains an open scientific
question. In this paper, we develop a dynamic causal model at scale
to disentangle value attributable to an ES, and to assess its effec-
tiveness. We demonstrate the application of this model to inform
business decision-making by understanding returns on investment
in the ES, and identifying product lines and features where the ES
adds the most value.

1 INTRODUCTION
Causal frameworks are a powerful tool to provide actionable in-
sights into complex business problems. Businesses can make data-
driven decisions by understanding cause-and-effect relationships to
maximize efficiency and allocate resources better. There has been
an increased effort in both academic research and industry to use
causal inference for informed decision-making and to measure eco-
nomic impact. This work has led to the development of open source
packages such CausalML [ 1] for uplift modeling in marketing cam-
paigns, PyWhy [ 2,3] for causal reasoning and evaluating interven-
tions, and EconML [ 4‚Äì6] for estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects in customer segments. Large organizations require accurate
measurement of long-term causal impacts to calculate the returns
on their investments correctly. Reliable and scalable strategies to
do this are therefore increasingly important.
The share of online shopping has steadily grown around the
world. In the US, the percentage of online shopping has grown
from less than 1% in 2000 to around 15% in 2023 [ 7]. Providing the
best shopping experience for online customers is therefore a high
priority for retail businesses around the world. Combined with de-
velopments in artificial intelligence (AI), this has led to the creation
of Engagement Surfaces (ES). An ES is any application, feature, wid-
get (or collection thereof) that is intended to help customers save
time, reduce shopping effort, and support new product discovery.
Almost all prominent e-commerce companies have sophisticated
ES to improve customer shopping experiences. Additionally, there
are some companies that offer integration of an engagement surface
as a service to online sellers [ 8]. Depending on the level of sophis-
tication, an ES typically performs one or more of the following
functions.
‚Ä¢Help customers discover new products or products that they
may be interested in
‚Ä¢Generate shopping lists
‚Ä¢Provide discount codes and special offers

‚Ä¢Recover abandoned shopping carts
‚Ä¢Offer personalized product recommendations and reorder
suggestions
‚Ä¢Answer customer questions
‚Ä¢Track orders and returns
Despite the prevalence and sophistication of ES, it is unclear exactly
how much this has enhanced customer experience, and how that
has translated into revenue for the business. The economic rationale
for ES hinges primarily on the use of an ES leading to increased
customer spend and interactions with monetizable features in the
medium to long run. However, causally attributing increase in sales
to use of the ES is a hard scientific problem given the interconnected
nature of hundreds of types of customer behavior over time, as well
as the breadth of concurrent features that customers are exposed to.
Nevertheless, understanding this causal relationship is important
to businesses as it guides the capital investment made to offer ES
to customers, which may be sizable.
We also note that conducting A/B tests [ 9] (i.e., randomized con-
trol trials, which are generally regarded as the gold standard for
causal analysis) with the full ES experience is often impossible due
to practical or ethical constraints. It might be possible to use A/B
experimentation for valuing a specific feature of an ES, but such
an approach usually only operates with a small customer sample
and requires a disciplined methodology to map to the entire pop-
ulation. Moreover, A/B testing may prove expensive when done
repeatedly for new feature rollout, and may not be possible for all
available features. This motivates our approach, where we leverage
observational causal modeling, which requires additional assump-
tions but provides a scalable and repeatable solution paradigm. In
this work, we build a large-scale Dynamic Causal Model (DCM)
trained on billions of customer actions, and apply it to the problem
of estimating the value generated by an ES. The DCM helps us
answer a counterfactual question ‚Äì "How much money would the
business lose if the Engagement Surface didn‚Äôt exist at all (or didn‚Äôt
exist during a specific period of time)?". Measuring this associated
treatment effect is a good proxy for the value generated by the
ES. We highlight that while our solution is applicable to any ES,
we focus in particular on cases where ES features may be highly
interconnected in customer usage patterns, and may drive the most
value when operating synchronously.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper presenting
a scalable and generalizable causal model for estimating the value
generated by an engagement surface. The paper is structured as
follows. In Sec. 2, we provide an introduction and motivation for
the dynamic causal model. In Sec. 3, we discuss inclusion of con-
temporaneous treatment effects arising from concurrent customer
behavior (which is relevant for the use case of valuing an ES). We
provide an overview of implementation in Sec. 4 and showcase re-
sults in Sec. 5. We end with conclusions and our recommendations
for further study in Sec. 6.
2 DYNAMIC CAUSAL MODEL
We developed a Dynamic Causal Model (DCM) to identify medi-
ated causal effects and interactions in high dimensions over a long
period of time in order to generate interesting aggregate business
counterfactual analyses. One such example would be estimating theoverall causal effect of removal of specific product lines or features.
This model was developed in part to avoid some of the limitations
of binary treatment effect estimation of a single customer action
[10]. The DCM models the interaction across time periods between
all model variables and outcomes of interest (typically customer
spending or revenue generated). We refer to variables capturing
customer interactions with the shopping interface as surrogates
‚Äî following terminology in econometrics for short-term observed
features associated with longer-term outcomes of interest. These
are typically structured to identify customer behavior such as pur-
chases and new program sign ups. The dynamic framework offers
numerous advantages, notably by allowing treatment effects in
one period to impact subsequent surrogates, generating cascading
spillover effects, and leading to mediated causal pathways that are
important to account for. Moreover, such a structure also enables
joint-policy evaluation, where we can consider complex counter-
factual scenarios where a large group of causal pathways may be
blocked off, attenuated or enhanced. Finally, we resolve the issue
of evaluating the combined impact of different surrogates, which
could be double counted or incorrectly aggregated if being studied
through separate binary interventions, as is usually the case in
online A/B testing.
The DCM framework models hundreds of customer surrogates/actions
over time and parametrizes the associations between them. Figure 1

arrows represent direct relationships. The dashed arrow rep-
resent indirect (mediated) relationships.
shows a simplified 3-period example to explain the key elements of
the model. We measure the relationship between surrogate 1and
surrogateùêæfromùë°=1toùë°=2(solid arrow), but can also observe
the relationship between surrogate 1and surrogate ùêæfromùë°=1to
ùë°=3(dashed arrow), and vice versa between surrogate ùêæand sur-
rogate 1. The surrogate variables help isolate the possible channels
through which a causal effect propagates over time to outcomes
or other surrogates. This allows us to quantify how surrogates at
a particular point in time affect other surrogates or outcomes in
future periods. A major advantage of such a model is that we prop-
erly capture mediated effects, where changes in a surrogate at a
point in time continue to generate ripple effects in future periods
through interactions with subsequent surrogate variables.
5557Valuing an Engagement Surface using a Large Scale Dynamic Causal Model KDD ‚Äô24, August 25‚Äì29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
The model estimates a set of equations which capture surrogate
interactions as described above. The solution strategy we employ
estimates these associations and then simulates counterfactuals
that capture the state of the ecosystem at any point in time (or
across time) when specific input surrogates are ‚Äòshocked‚Äô. A ‚Äòshock‚Äô
here refers to a scenario where a surrogate (or a group of surro-
gates) is increased/decreased (or set to zero) for a point in time, or
over a period of time. The model propagates this shock through the
dynamic system of equations and then aggregates the effects to gen-
erate a counterfactual (i.e., under the shocked condition) measure
that can be used to compute outcomes of interest across a chosen
period. Surrogates can be configured to represent product lines or
entire businesses, and the model can therefore capture the effect of
‚Äòshutting down‚Äô this group of customer behaviors. The DCM is an
improvement over the causal impact estimation framework for a
single customer action [ 10]. It is able to handle overlapping inter-
actions amongst customer events and provides a way to estimate
long term causal effects in a scientifically disciplined way.
2.1 DCM Training
While non-linear versions of the DCM are possible to construct,
we define for this application a partially linear model to evaluate
an outcome ùë¶ùë°with respect to binary policy ùê∑, and define ùëÜto be
the surrogate variable which captures the impact of any exogenous
policy change attributed to ùê∑.ùëì(.)andùëî(.)represent functions
controlling for variation attributable to pre-determined customer
featuresùëã0. A customer‚Äôs surrogate and revenue values at time ùë°
are defined by
ùëÜùë°=ùë°‚àí1‚àëÔ∏Å
ùë†=0ùëÜùë†ùúãùë°,ùë†+ùëìùë°(ùëã0)+ùê∑ùúÉùë°+ùúàùë°
ùë¶ùë°=ùë°‚àí1‚àëÔ∏Å
ùë†=0ùëÜùë†ùõΩùë°,ùë†+ùëîùë°(ùëã0)+ùê∑ùúÇùë°+ùúñùë° (1)
whereùúãùë°,ùë†,ùõΩùë°,ùë†,ùúÉùë°,ùúÇùë°are the coefficients to be learned during model
training.ùúàùë°andùúñùë°are zero-mean noise terms.
Note that Eqs. (1)are modeled per customer ùëñ. We omit the
subscriptùëñfor simplicity of exposition. The DCM framework in-
ternally uses a scalable regression algorithm to estimate hundreds
of regressions in Apache Spark [ 11]. It works with a JSON input
configuration which keeps it modular and flexible. Importantly, we
model customer actions and outcomes at a given time period as
a function of that customer‚Äôs lagged actions. That is, the baseline
model uses only past behavior on the right hand side of the re-
gression. The reason for this is that the model consumes data in a
panel format, and since we do not use timestamp-level information,
we cannot disentangle the causal direction of actions that occur
in the same time period. As we discuss in Section 3, this can ne-
glect intra-period effects that could be relevant for modeling ES ‚Äî
we overcome this by imposing some additional restrictions on the
causal graph implied by the DCM.
2.2 DCM Scoring
The second aspect of the framework involves the simulation tool
that uses the trained model parameters to predict potential out-
comes under alternate scenarios. Counterfactuals for business orproduct line elimination scenarios are computed by defining shocks
that change the outcomes of interest (e.g. customer spending/ unit
sales) and surrogates that belong to that specific business by a per-
centage amount. These shocks are applied in a sequential manner
because of which the dynamic structure cannot be solved in the
general case without recursion. For example, we simulate counter-
factuals in the above setup of Eq. (1) as follows:
(1)Define or estimate intervention ùúÉùë°(e.g., policy shock, surro-
gate size change).
(2)ùë°=0: Compute{ùëÜ(1)
0,ùëÜ(0)
0}directly off the inputs {ùëã0,ùúà0,ùúÉ0}.
This represents features at time ùë°=0.
(3)ùë°=1: Compute{ùëÜ(1)
1,ùëÜ(0)
1}from{ùëÜ(1)
0,ùëÜ(0)
0}and predeter-
mined inputs{ùëã0,ùúà1,ùúÉ1}.ùúÉ1is the shock generated and the
computed counterfactuals at ùë°=1are used as input for the
next time step.
(4)ùë°=2: Compute{ùëÜ(1)
2,ùëÜ(0)
2}from{ùëÜ(1)
1,ùëÜ(0)
1}and predeter-
mined inputs{ùëã0,ùúà2,ùúÉ2}.
(5)Repeat this process until you have reached the total number
of time periods ùëÅ.
3 CONTEMPORANEOUS TREATMENT
EFFECTS
In this section we will discuss an enhancement to the standard
DCM model (Eq. (1)) which is relevant when we use the model to
estimate value driven by an ES.
3.1 Business Motivation
Revisiting Fig. 1, we note that the standard DCM framework cap-
tures lagged causal effects (cause preceding the effect) on future
surrogates and outcomes at least one time unit apart. In practice,
the DCM framework is implemented using a weekly time grain.
That is, we aggregate activity for each customer on a weekly basis
and model Eqs. (1). Returning to the business use case of ES, we
note that an important value-add arises from friction reduction for
customers making purchases. As a result, value driven by the ES
is likely associated with near-simultaneous customer actions (e.g.,
when a customer engages with the ES to obtain information about
an item, adds it to cart, and completes their purchase in the same
hour). Since the DCM operates using data at a coarse time grain,
we refer to such actions as ‚Äúcontemporaneous‚Äù or ‚Äúsame-period‚Äù
actions. The DCM enhancement discussed here is important as it
ensures that we properly attribute customer actions in the same
period, mediated through the ES, towards its valuation. Note, given
the DCM structure, we regard any customer actions in that same
time period (e.g., week) as being ‚Äòsimultaneous‚Äô from a causal per-
spective.
To explain the intuition behind the same-period effects module
in our DCM, we consider a simple case with two businesses, the ES,
and business A1, and two time periods. Both businesses are assumed
to be represented by a single surrogate, and the outcome of interest
(revenue in this example) is realized in the second period (with
T=1 as a ‚Äúpre-period‚Äù of lagged surrogates for illustration). The
causal graph corresponding to this conventional/standard causal
relationship in DCM is shown in the left panel in Fig. 2.

Figure 2: Simplified representation of the DCM causal graph with and without the same-period effects.
If we modify this structure to incorporate same-period effects,
our model now captures how events in a particular time period
produce causal impact on other events and outcomes in that same
time period. This is designed to account for the near-simultaneous
cause and effect relationships such as those posited for an ES. In
this example with same-period effects, any near-simultaneous (and
therefore within one week/day/our minimum time grain) interac-
tions with the ES that lead to a purchase transaction are attributed
to have been caused by the ES. Returning to the causal graph in
Fig. 2, we allow for additional causal links (represented by green
dashed arrows) in the panel on the right. This enables the model to
learn associations between outcomes/surrogates of interest and ES
interactions in that same time period. We note that this requires
specifying the direction of the causal link as an identification as-
sumption, which in the case of the ES is assumed to run from the ES
surrogate ‚Äì this is a necessity given the fidelity available with this
time grain. That is, in the case of near-simultaneous events, we give
the ES credit for driving the causal effect. This is reasonable in the
case of an ES driving a revenue outcome, but would lead to misspec-
ification if ES interactions are in fact driven by actions/surrogates
in other businesses in the same period. Given that the ES functions
as a friction reducer for customers engaging in purchase behavior,
we expect this latter case is relatively infrequent with muted bias
induced in measured treatment effects as a result. Despite these
potential limitations, we choose to account for same-period effects
within the DCM framework to allow for ease of use and repeated
analyses, rather than using an auxiliary model to obtain contempo-
raneous incrementality inputs. One of our ongoing enhancements
to this framework relies on using short term A/B testing to learn
the direction of causal links and adjusting the regression structure
accordingly.
In the next section, we provide the mathematical details of the
framework to include the contemporaneous effects in the DCM.
3.2 Mathematical Framework
Let us denote ùëÜas the complete set of surrogates. Let ùêºùê¥be the
surrogates specifying the interactions with the ES and ùëÜùëÅùê¥be the
non-ES surrogates. So, ùëÜ=ùëÜùëÅùê¥‚à™ùêºùê¥andùëÜùëÅùê¥‚à©ùêºùê¥={}.
Based on the business context discussed in Sec. 3.1 and taking
motivation from the literature discussing vector autoregression
models [ 12‚Äì15], we update the standard DCM equations from Eq. (1)as follows:
ùë¶ùë°=ùõøùêºùê¥
ùë°+ùë°‚àí1‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëñ=0ùêºùê¥

ùë°,ùëò+ùëûùë°(ùëã0)+ùúìùë°
ùëÜùëÅùê¥
ùë° =ùõæùêºùê¥
ùë°+ùë°‚àí1‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëñ=0ùêºùê¥
ùëñùõΩùê¥
ùë°,ùëñ+ùë°‚àí1‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëò=0ùëÜùëÅùê¥
ùëòùõΩùëÅùê¥
ùë°,ùëò+ùëîùë°(ùëã0)+ùë¢ùë°
ùêºùê¥
ùë°=ùë°‚àí1‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëñ=0ùêºùê¥

ùëòùúåùëÅùê¥
ùë°,ùëò+ùëöùë°(ùëã0)+ùúêùë° (2)
We can simplify the right-hand side (RHS) of Eqs. (2) to use ùëÜ:
ùë¶ùë°=ùõøùêºùê¥
ùë°+ùë°‚àí1‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëñ=0ùëÜùëñùúÖùë°,ùëñ+ùëûùë°(ùëã0)+ùúìùë° (3)
ùëÜùëÅùê¥
ùë° =ùõæùêºùê¥
ùë°+ùë°‚àí1‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëñ=0ùëÜùëñùõΩùë°,ùëñ+ùëîùë°(ùëã0)+ùë¢ùë° (4)
ùêºùê¥
ùë°=ùë°‚àí1‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëñ=0ùëÜùëñùúåùë°,ùëñ+ùëöùë°(ùëã0)+ùúêùë° (5)
Recall that the Eq. (2)-Eq.(5)are modeled at the customer level.
We have dropped the customer index here for brevity.
As pointed out in the Sec. 3.1, business context is necessary to
specify the appropriate causal links in the same-period equations.
In Eqs. (3)-(5), we assume following constraints on the causal graph:
‚Ä¢Only ES interactions can impact surrogates/outcomes in the
same period. This is denoted by the presence of the ùêºùê¥
ùë°term
on the RHS of Eqs. (3) and (4).
‚Ä¢Non-ES surrogates cannot cause any surrogate/outcome in
the same period. This is the standard DCM temporal con-
straint to avoid causal loops.
‚Ä¢ES interactions of one type cannot cause ES interactions
of another type in the same period. This is indicated by
equation for ùêºùê¥
ùë°only having the lagged surrogates on the
RHS.
To generalize to other business cases, we would allow same
period causal effects from the business of interest onto any surro-
gate/outcome subject to restrictions based on business knowledge
of the direction of causality (eg. actions cause outcomes but not
vice versa). We are currently working on improving this through
5559Valuing an Engagement Surface using a Large Scale Dynamic Causal Model KDD ‚Äô24, August 25‚Äì29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
causal graph discovery in the same period, that would allow the
model to learn the appropriate causal directionality and impose
these constraints in the regression structure.
In the next section we give an overview of the implementation
of the same-period DCM model for the ES use case.
4 IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW
The high-level implementation steps are as follows:
(1)We analyze the weekly spending of millions of customers
for 3 years (denoted by ùë¶ùë°in Eq. (3)).
(2)We also analyze the weekly participation of the same sample
of customers in the standard surrogates (denoted by ùëÜùëÅùê¥
in Eq. (2)). We have about 2000 such surrogates today to
represent customer behavior.
(3)To the above two, we join the weekly interactions of the
customers with the ES. As mentioned in Sec. 1, customers in-
teract with the ES in multiple ways. We worked with business
partners to consolidate the different customer interactions
into feature groups. These are denoted by ùêºùê¥
ùë°in Eq. (2). The
ES we are working with operates in three broad channels,
and we analyze the customer participation in ES feature
groups of interest across all these three channels.
(4)Based on the historical surrogate/ interaction feature partici-
pation data and the historical spend, we learn the coefficients
in Eqs. (3)-(5).
(5)Once the model has been trained, to estimate the value of
a certain ES channel or feature we use the model to con-
struct the counterfactual scenario where the specified ES
channel/feature is unavailable to customers. This is done
through dynamic model scoring as described in Sec. 2.2.
In Appendix A, we discuss some nuances related to DCM training
and scoring while incorporating same-period effects. We note that
inclusion of same-period effects has no impact on computational
efficiency or model run time.
4.1 Shapley Attribution
The DCM framework also allows us to apply attribution algorithms
to business valuations. This becomes relevant when estimating the
model for multiple businesses that jointly generate value to ensure
that value is not being double counted. An important application
of such valuations for business stakeholders is in sizing financial
investments and optimizing product selection. To do this effectively,
we needed to develop the capability to structure model output for
direct comparison with financial accounts. In other words, valua-
tions produced by the DCM framework should tally with revenue
reported in financial statements. Shapley Attribution [ 16,17] is our
default method of doing this, and is effectively based on a weighted
average of how much a business contributes when it is added to a
group of other active businesses at the margin, across all combina-
tions. In the case of ES valuation, this allows us to understand the
marginal contribution to different product lines given the invest-
ment required to support ES tooling. More details regarding this
are provided in Appendix B.4.2 System Architecture Overview
Figure 3 showcases the current system architecture of the DCM
framework. The framework has been developed using modular
components in order to prioritize ease of maintenance and scal-
ability. There is minimal dependency between modules enabling
faster, parallel development cycles and reducing downtime if cer-
tain components need to be updated. We emphasize adaptability to
a wide range of use cases, and interpretability (transparent insights
that help us understand what is driving any result). The model is
implemented in Apache Spark, and is structured with a pipeline
design pattern that processes data in a series of stages, with each
stage performing specific operations on the data. We build custom
SparkML pipelines using Transformers and Estimators in Spark
as required. An added advantage is that the inherited serialization
and deserialization persist when loading the fitted models. This
design pattern avoids any replication of code in training/scoring
orchestration or manual configuration changes to map with trained
models.
The DCM framework utilizes a stateless design function where
model training and scoring are designed to be independent stages.
The scoring input can be processed by using a training pipeline
without requiring any further context or other state information.
This simplifies the parameters needed during inference and en-
ables easy broadcast of functions/parameters to enable distributed
scoring.
Experimentation at high velocity is another key feature of the
framework. We achieved this by creating batch tooling that is pow-
ered through AWS Lambda [ 18] to execute multiple parallel in-
ference runs. The base model configuration can be overridden in
parallel runs that spin up and terminate clusters after completion.
All artifacts are logged into MLFlow [ 19] enabling easy tracking
of experiments, reproduction of model results, and sharing model
runs across different users. The linear model structure enables us
to disentangle the effect of each surrogate variable on outcomes
and other surrogates, and recovering coefficient values allows us to
interpret causal effects and provide insights on customer behavior.
The DCM model uses the MLFlow model registry to log models that
can be read back to examine the learned weights. Additionally, the
framework allows for confidence interval estimation on valuations
through bootstrapped runs. The ES model runs use ‚àº100 million
customers analyzed over 3 years at a weekly grain, with over 2000
features per time period.
This has been possible using PySpark and SparkML [ 20] Trans-
formers and Estimators and utilizing sparse vectors for data com-
pression. Another optimization that we added is in-memory cre-
ation of lagged features used on the RHS of Eq. (1). We score the
model linearly across time periods, using the input scoring data
and the trained model pipeline. This iterative autoregressive ap-
proach is suboptimal given Spark‚Äôs lazy computation, which relies
on creating dynamic plans first and then executing the computation
graph. This leads to slow execution time, as the computation graph
becomes intractably huge. To overcome this, we utilized check-
pointing to break the lineage in the computation graph and force
periodic calculation.

5 RESULTS
In this section we discuss our main results, estimating the value
generated by the ES using the DCM framework. We provide valua-
tions for individual ES channels as well as the overall valuation. We
anonymize the channel names to preserve business confidentiality.
Note that the total ES value is not a simple sum of individual chan-
nels because some of the value of each channel is jointly determined
with other channels (i.e., the incremental value of each channel is
affected by the presence of other channels).
The ES generates value by improving customer satisfaction lead-
ing to increased engagement and purchases. Along with the total
incremental spend across all channels (which corresponds to the
total ES value), we also look at different slices across the three ES
channels and the different product groups that ES facilitates shop-
ping for. Numbers in Table 1 answer questions like ‚ÄúHow much
revenue would have been lost in each of the product groups in the
full year 2022 if the ES was not available in a certain channel?‚Äù
Product groups are broad categories such as grocery, electronics,
apparel etc. Looking at the value for different product groups al-
lows us to gain insights into whether the ES adds more value in
one category versus another. To maintain business confidentiality,
we scale all numbers in Table 1 through Table 5 between 0 and 100
by normalizing with the total estimated causal value for the ES. Ad-
ditionally, we also anonymize the product group names, channels
and features. The key insights from our results are as follows:
1. Top channel drives over 50% of ES value: Based on Table 1, we
see that the highest monetary value for ES comes from Channel 2.
This is consistent with the idea that this was a channel with broader
reach driving the most customer engagement and hence the most
monetary value. We also produced bootstrap confidence bounds to
quantify sampling error. These bounds are generally quite narrow,
even at the product group level (typically within 5-7% of the point
estimate).
2. The ES drives the highest value in low average selling price (ASP)
and regular purchase categories: When looking at the incrementalimpact of ES interactions on the different product group categories,
we notice that over 85% of them are from low ASP and frequent
purchase categories. Examples includes categories such as baby
products, beauty products, apparel, and grocery. Customers may
be more interested in engaging with the ES for products that are
more regularly purchased, where Q&A (to gather product infor-
mation) and price checks are more useful, and where a customer‚Äôs
time investment in product selection and search is less beneficial.
Our findings are overall consistent with our intuition given the
nature of ES features: friction-reduction customer experience (in
the current form available) drives the most value in product groups
that customers are likely already familiar with, or that are more
frequent and/or low ASP buys for which customers perceive less
risk in acting based on purchase-relevant information provided
through the ES.
3. Top two features drive 73% of ES‚Äôs impact: We also estimated the
value lost if specific ES interaction features (such as those offering
tracking or product information) were not available. Table 2 shows
valuations for each interaction feature for the ES as a whole, as well
as broken out by the different channels. The effects in this table
are not strictly additive, but still helps us identify the major value
driving features. We observe that the bulk of the value (over 73%)
comes from the top two feature categories. These feature categories
are associated with re-buys and finding product information. Given
that most of the ES value is driven by low-ASP/ regularly purchased
products, it is reasonable that features supporting efficient repeat
orders and product information provision are important for the ES.
4. Near-simultaneity of ES interaction and purchases plays a large
role in value driven: As mentioned in Sec. 3, we updated the stan-
dard DCM model to better capture causal flows between the ES and
other customer actions in the same time period (one week in the
model specification we used). The output from the model which
does not include the same-period effects is shown in Table 3. For
ease of interpretation, Table 4 shows the difference in incremental
revenue between Table 1 and Table 3. This captures the value that

we would have missed had we not properly accounted for same-
period effects in the DCM. We were previously concerned that
omitting these same-period effects would result in undervaluation
of the ES. Indeed, when we disable same-period effects, we esti-
mate that the value of the ES is 25% smaller. Comparing the three
channels, the impact of same-period effects is again intuitive. The
impact is larger in channels where the customers are most likely
to complete purchases within a shorter time frame. In Table 5, we
provide the contribution of same-period effects to the individual
feature valuations. Comparing this to Table 2, we notice that for cer-
tain features over 25% of the valuation comes from the same-period
effects. This again underscores the importance of incorporating
same-period effects when valuing customer-initiated upper-funnel
actions such as those produced through ES interaction.
6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this work, we introduced a Dynamic Causal Model (DCM) which
helps us identify the causal effect of a business under consider-
ation, on value generated for the company. The strength of the
model lies in its ability to extract causal insights in a fundamentally
multivariate scenario with complex interdependencies. The DCM
achieves this by modeling interactions between thousands of cus-
tomer actions over several years. The recursive dynamic scoring
approach allows us to construct interesting business counterfactu-
als by "shocking" (changing and projecting based on the model) the
relevant outcomes and surrogates. The modular implementation
using Apache Spark allows us to scale, and our pipeline architecture
enables flexibility in analyzing different use cases efficiently.
We applied the DCM framework to evaluate the value generated
by an Engagement Surface (ES). Companies leveraging ES hope to
provide a better shopping journey for online customers. However,
the only way an ES generates value is by increased spending amongthe customers that interact with ES. DCM provides a principled
causal framework to estimate this value. Absent such a model,
analysts studying the financial value proposition would run the
risk of neglecting to account for selection bias and mediated effects,
and to properly control for other predictive surrogates.
We noted that since the ES acts as a friction reducer for customers
making purchases, the value driven by the ES depends on near
simultaneous or same-period customer actions. We discussed our
improvements to the DCM framework to account for the effects
of these same-period actions. We found that failing to include the
same-period effects underestimates the total ES value by 25%. The
ES value is more affected by same-period effects in the channels
where customers are likely to complete purchases within a shorter
time frame.
Our work also sheds light on certain interesting aspects of cus-
tomer behavior when it comes to engaging with an ES. We observed
that customers are more interested in engaging with the ES we ex-
amine for products that are more regularly purchased, have a lower
ASP, and where customer‚Äôs time investment in product selection is
less beneficial. We also demonstrated the versatility of our frame-
work through its ability to obtain the value driven by individual
ES features groups. Modifying the shocks allows us to construct
counterfactuals of interest and thereby study the value created by
the ES across arbitrary segments.
Causal-based valuations like the ones we provided drive im-
portant long-term capital allocation decisions. They are especially
challenging to obtain when there are multiple businesses within an
organization and these business create value by supporting other
business directly or indirectly. While we focus here on the use case
of valuing an ES, we emphasize that our framework is flexible and
can be leveraged for valuing any business or feature set of interest.
6.1 Future Work
6.1.1 Validation. One of the challenges in validating observational
causal estimates is summarized by the Fundamental Problem of
Causal Inference [21]. The lack of observable ground truth makes it
difficult to validate the output of a causal model. Businesses often
use online RCTs for individual feature launch decisions. A naive
way to obtain total value from RCTs is through rolling up estimates
across different experiments. The major flaw with such bespoke
summation is that RCTs are often sequential tests of individual
feature improvements rather than holdouts of the entire customer
experience that a program (such as the Engagement Surface in
our example) offers. There are also secondary issues related to

and the role of long-term effects when annualizing short term
experimental evidence.
Building an apples-to-apples technique of comparing valuations
from the DCM model to RCT-based valuations is part of our ongoing
work.
6.1.2 Non-linear functional form. In its current form, the DCM
framework accounts for interdependencies among different cus-
tomer action through a system of linear equations (e.g., Eq. (1)). The
use of linear system makes our framework easier to interpret and
helps with building confidence in results through its transparency.
It also speeds up the computation. We had previously noted that
our methodology is agnostic to the specifics of the modeling frame-
work. There is a case to be made that using a non-linear model will
help us capture more complex patterns of customer action interde-
pendencies and we have been exploring it. Leveraging transformer
architecture [ 22] instead of the current lag structure is another
active area of investigation.

A IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
In this section, we discuss the implementation details of the same-
period model enhancement.
As touched upon in Sec. 2, the DCM framework uses a JSON
input configuration. In the standard DCM, as defined in Eqs. (1),
the outcome and surrogate variables at time ùë°are regressed on the
lagged surrogates (i.e., surrogate values at the previous time steps).
As the same features are used on the RHS for both outcome and
surrogates, the section of the input training config that defines the
regression structure is given by a sample snippet in Fig. 4.
Figure 4: JSON config snippet depicting the regression struc-
ture in the standard DCM framework.
The regression structure changes when we want to incorporate
same-period effects as shown in Eqs. (2). Specifically, the predictors
are different depending on if we are estimating the ES interaction
features or the non-ES surrogates (and Outcomes). This is reflected
in the JSON config as show in Fig. 5
We updated the DCM training code to make sure it can work
with different predictors based on the choice of target. One nuance
to note during model scoring is that the value of ES interaction
feature at time ùë°(denoted by ùêºùê¥
ùë°in Eq. (5)) needs to estimated to
obtain the value of outcome and non-ES surrogates at the same time
periodùë°(denoted by ùë¶ùë°andùëÜùëÅùê¥
ùë°in Eqs. (3)and(4)respectively).
This means that during same-period scoring, Eq. (5)needs to be
evaluated first before either Eqs. (3)or(5). We updated the DCM
scoring module to make sure this is properly accounted for.

small irrespective of other inputs.
