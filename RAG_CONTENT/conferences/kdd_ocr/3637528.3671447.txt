Abstract
AI projects often face the challenge of limited access to meaningful
amounts of training data. In traditional approaches, collecting data
in a central location can be problematic, especially in industry
settings with sensitive and distributed data. However, there is a
solution - "moving the computation to the data" through Federated
Learning.
Federated Learning, a distributed machine learning approach,
offers a promising solution by enabling model training across de-
vices. It is a data minimization approach where direct access to data
is not required. Furthermore, federated learning can be combined
with techniques like differential privacy, secure aggregation, homo-
morphic encryption, and others, to further enhance privacy protec-
tion. In this hands-on tutorial, we delve into the realm of privacy-
preserving machine learning using federated learning, leveraging
the Flower framework which is specifically designed to simplify
the process of building federated learning systems, as our primary
tool.
Moreover, we present the foundations of federated learning,
explore how different techniques can enhance its privacy aspects,
how it is being used in real-world settings today and a series of
practical, hands-on code examples that showcase how you can
federate any AI project with Flower, an open-source framework for
all-this federated.

Javier Fernandez-Marques is a lead research scientist at Flower
Labs. He works on the core framework and develops the Flower
Simulation Engine, which allows running Federated Learning work-
loads in a resource-aware manner and scale these to thousands of
active clients. Javier’s interests lie in the intersection of Machine
Learning and Systems, and more concretely running on-device ML
workloads, a key component in Federated Learning. Javier got his
PhD in Computer Science from the University of Oxford in 2021.
Before joining Flower Labs, he worked as a research scientist at
Samsung AI (Cambridge, UK).
Yan Gao is a research scientist at Flower Labs, where his work
is at the forefront of federated learning innovation with different
types of models, including XGBoost, LLMs, etc. Prior to this role,
he completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge within the
Machine Learning System Lab. His research interests include ma-
chine learning, federated learning, self-supervised learning, and
optimisation techniques. Throughout his doctoral studies, he fo-
cused on pioneering research in federated self-supervised learning,
specifically targeting the challenge of working with unlabelled
data across diverse domains such as audio, image, and video. This
groundbreaking work has been recognised and published in several
top-tier international conferences and journals, including ICCV,
ECCV, ICLR, INTERSPEECH, ICCASP, and JMLR, marking signifi-
cant contributions to the field of federated learning and its applica-
tions.
Heng Pan is a Research Scientist at Flower Labs specializes in
federated learning and the integration of secure aggregation func-
tionalities into the Flower framework. He holds a master’s degree
from the university of Cambridge, where he collaborated with Prof.
Nic Lane. He was part of the team from university of Cambridge
that won the first prize in the UK-US PETs Prize Challenge for cre-
ating a privacy-centric solution to detect anomalies in the SWIFT
network. His expertise lies at the intersection of machine learning,
federated learning, and data security.
