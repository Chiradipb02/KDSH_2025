ABSTRACT
Ethical AI has become increasingly important, and it has been at-
tracting attention from academia and industry, due to its increased
popularity in real-world applications with fairness concerns. It
also places fundamental importance on ethical considerations in
determining legitimate and illegitimate uses of AI. Organizations
that apply ethical AI have clearly stated well-defined review pro-
cesses to ensure adherence to legal guidelines. Therefore, the wave
of research at the intersection of ethical AI in data mining and
machine learning has also influenced other fields of science, includ-
ing computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement
learning, and social science. Despite these successes, ethical AI still
faces many challenges, such as a lack of interpretable and explain-
able methods for fairness-aware deep learning models, etc. Conse-
quently, there is an urgent need to bring experts and researchers
together at prestigious venues to discuss ethical AI, which has
been rarely seen in previous KDD conferences. This workshop
will provide a premium platform for both research and industry
from different backgrounds to exchange ideas on opportunities,
challenges, and cutting-edge techniques in ethical AI.

1 BACKGROUND
As computers increasingly make decisions about who gets a loan, a
job, or even bail, the expansion of AI algorithms has provoked public
concern about ethical issues [ 1–8], and the need to understand what
constitutes AI algorithms and how they make decisions becomes
ever more pressing. For example, an increasing number of high-
profile news reports that widely used algorithms have unfairly
discriminated against some groups of people (e.g., by gender and
race) in parole decisions and other major life events. Focusing more
attention on ethical bias in learning algorithms is key to unlocking
the potential of automated decision systems while ensuring fairness
and accountability so that everyone can advance equally in society.
2 RELEVANCE TO SIGKDD
ACM SIGKDD conference is the premier international forum for
knowledge discovery and data mining researchers and practitioners
from academia, industry, and government to share their research
findings, results, and experiences. The organizers and invited PC
members of this workshop have a wealth of experience and a strong
interest in ethical AI and they come from different backgrounds in
academia, industry, and government. Knowledge discovery and data
mining are core AI topics with significant implications in ethical
AI, but they have not yet received significant attention from the
ethical AI community at SIGKDD. This workshop will provide a
great opportunity for all SIGKDD attendees to exchange ideas and
thoughts on opportunities, challenges, and techniques in ethical AI
and it will build a bridge of communication for people with different
backgrounds and promote the future development of ethical AI.
3 TOPIC OF INTEREST
We encourage submissions in various degrees of progress, such as
new results, visions, techniques, innovative application papers, and
progress reports under the topics that include, but are not limited
to, the following broad categories:
•Algorithmic fairness and bias on classifying and clustering big
data
•Human-in-the-loop for ethical-aware machine learning
•Ethical recommended systems and diversity in recommendation

KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Chen Zhao, Feng Chen, Xintao Wu, Jundong Li, & Haifeng Chen
•Learning ethical-aware representation on heterogeneous data
domains
•Causality-based fairness in high-dimensional data
•Integration of observation for causality-based bias control
•Preserving fairness in graph embedding
•Novel visualization techniques to facilitate the query and analysis
of data bias
•Robustness and generalization of large language models
•Bias mitigation and fairness of large language models
•Explainability, interpretability, privacy and security of large lan-
guage models
•First hand experience creating or with company practices for
ethical AI
And with particular focuses but not limited to these applications:
•Application of ethical AI methods in large-scale data mining
•Computer vision (fairness in face recognition, object relation;
debiasing in image processing and video)
•Natural language processing (fair text generation, semantic pars-
ing)
•Reinforcement learning (fairness-aware multi-agent learning,
compositional imitation learning)
•Social science (racial profiling, institutional racism)
4 INVITED KEYNOTE SPEAKER
We are proposing to have 2 keynote speakers.
•James Caverlee (Texas A&M University). Dr. James Caverlee is
a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engi-
neering at Texas A&M University. His research research focuses
on connecting people to information, with an emphasis on algo-
rithms and systems that are trustworthy, resilient, and respon-
sible. His work has been supported by an NSF CAREER award,
an AFOSR Young Investigator Award, a DARPA Young Faculty
Award, and grants from Google, Amazon, AFOSR, DARPA, and

able Mention, the 2020 CIKM Test of Time Award, plus several
departmental and college-level teaching awards.

ference Proceeding templates (two-column format). Template guide-
lines are: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template.
Following this KDD conference submission policy, reviews are
double-blind, and author names and affiliations should NOT be
listed. Submitted papers will be assessed based on their novelty,
technical quality, potential impact, and clarity of writing. For pa-
pers that rely heavily on empirical evaluations, the experimental
methods and results should be clear, well-executed, and repeatable.
Authors are strongly encouraged to make data and code publicly
available whenever possible. The accepted papers will be posted
on the workshop website but will not be included in the KDD
proceedings.
Upon notification, we ask authors of accepted works to de-
anonymize their papers, make any final changes, and then submit
a camera-ready version to the CMT submission site. The workshop
website will then be updated with links to accepted papers. Note
that accepted works will not be formally published. This means:
•Authors can retain the full copyright of their works.
•Work in accepted papers is not precluded from being published
in other research venues.
•Submitted papers are allowed to have significant overlap with
previously published or currently submitted work (in this case,
please indicate overlapping works).
