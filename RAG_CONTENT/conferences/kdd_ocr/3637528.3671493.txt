1 WORKSHOP TOPIC
Since 2016, the Fragile Earth Workshop has brought together the re-
search community to find and explore how data science can measure
and progress climate and social issues, following the framework of
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Over
the years, Fragile Earth workshop has focused on SDGs. Many as-
pects of sustainable development such as environmental justice
and planetary health involve complex spatial-temporal interactions.
Various methods in earth data analytics, including spatial-temporal
statistics, spatial evolutionary algorithms, remote sensing image
analysis, wireless geo-sensors, and location-based analytics, are
emerging disciplines in understanding complex interactions.
In 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
released its report on a “physical science basis" stating that climate
change was caused “unequivocally" by human action. In 2022, the

https://doi.org/10.1145/3637528.3671493IPCC’s latest report on “impacts, adaptation and vulnerability" em-
phasized that the time for action is now. These reports, parts of
the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), provide new estimates of the
chances of crossing global warming thresholds, discuss the urgent
need for adaptation pathways, and find that unless there are imme-
diate, rapid, and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,
limiting warming will be beyond reach. The ramifications of these
climate scenarios are devastating for the planet. As we fail to reach
mitigation and adaptation targets, we will witness the triggering
of more frequent sweltering heat waves, stronger storms, higher
floods, severe droughts, and drastic ecosystem shifts, with disas-
trous consequences for human lives, economies, and health, as well
as biodiversity.
The generative and foundational models in the context of climate
change and sustainable development present significant potential
and intricate challenges. Generative models, simulating advanced
climate scenarios, offer a powerful tool for predicting local and
global climate patterns, while foundational models, rooted in ex-
tensive knowledge bases, provide a solid understanding of climate
systems. Together, they can also support the realization of digital
twins for local contexts, aiding in sustainable development strate-
gies. These models facilitate nuanced analyses of environmental
impacts, enhance public awareness, and inform policymakers for
sustainable practices.
However, integrating these models in a secure and trustworthy
way introduces challenges, including ensuring prediction accuracy,
quantifying uncertainties, addressing biases in historical data, and
navigating ethical concerns. Diverse datasets and knowledge in-
tegration are crucial to avoid disparities and bias, while ethical
considerations aim to prevent misinformation dissemination. Bal-
ancing the strengths of these models is imperative for advancing

the Sustainable Development Plan, fostering global awareness, and
formulating effective policies for a resilient future.
An additional challenge we face as we bring in generative and
foundational models into this arena is the need for “sustainable
computation" in operationalizing them. While these models have
the potential and promise of a valuable enabler for facilitating
sustainable development in a broad range of scenarios, industries
and facets of society, their expanding scope and scale pose the
question of how to realize the vast amount of computation required
to train and apply them in a sustainable manner. This is another
important agenda in this emerging area of research.
The Workshop will target both methodological and applied re-
search agenda within these areas of investigation. The methodolog-
ical agenda of interest include but are not limited to the integration
of physics into data-driven modeling, the use of machine learning
to enhance physical simulations, model explainability, uncertainty
quantification, ethics, privacy and fairness questions in environ-
mental modeling, causal learning in the complex physical world as
foundations for model trustworthiness, AI applications at low en-
ergy edge devices and digital twin technology, combining predictive
and prescriptive tasks, and multi-agent systems for participatory
modeling that integrate stakeholders into knowledge creation and
decision processes. The application problems and agenda of interest
include the Sustainable Development Goals, accelerating progress
on the United Nations’ 2030 agenda, envisioning solutions for cli-
mate mitigation and adaptation, and measuring and diminishing
the inequitable benefits and burdens across socioeconomic groups.
In particular, the workshop has maintained a strong focus and
community in the following areas: food security, sustainable agri-
cultural practices and supply chains, ecosystem restoration, water
management, sustainable energy, climate action and adaptation,
socioeconomic equality, and disaster resilience.
2 AUDIENCE
As the target audience, we have in mind the scientific community
across Machine Learning, Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery, and
Statistics, as well as key professional stakeholders, policy makers,
agronomists, crop scientists, hydrologists, environmental scientists,
climatologists, agricultural practitioners (farmers, cooperatives),
industrial players (seed producers, equipment manufacturers, fer-
tilizer producers, energy utility companies, water companies, con-
sumer products manufacturers and retailers, insurance companies),
and food, energy, and water and sustainability-related government
agencies and policy makers in the public sector (e.g., UN, USGS,
NASA, EPA). With a focus on Environmental Justice, we hope to
also attract behavioral and social scientists and policy makers. The
workshop will offer opportunities for in-depth discussion, sharing
of methodology, and the release of new data/algorithmic resources.
The goals of this workshop (series) are three-fold: 1. To intro-
duce the emerging area of “generative and foundational models
for sustainable development" to the KDD community; 2. To invite
scientists and practitioners in the domains to the KDD community,
and interest them in leveraging our technology and expertise; 3.
To innovate new technology, leveraging existing KDD technology
where appropriate, to address the challenges we face in the relevant
domains, by bringing together a multi-disciplinary audience and
enticing them to interact and synergize.3 RELEVANCE
The Fragile Earth Workshop was one of three workshops associ-
ated with the planned Earth Day event at KDD 2019 (organized by
our OC members, Shashi Shekhar and James Hodson), provided
keynotes and panels for Earth Day in 2020, and has been a recurring
workshop at the annual KDD conference for the past seven years.
We continue this tradition in 2024 as well. The affiliated workshop
series has had strong industry interest and endorsement, including
from the Midwest Big Data Hub, Cargill, AI for Good Foundation,
and Syngenta, and has taken place at KDD every year since 2016.
The Fragile Earth workshop provides the KDD community with a
touch point for stakeholders outside of the community, including
scientists, technologists, and policymakers, as evidenced by a spe-
cial issue on the topic of “Big Data for Food, Energy and Water" in
the Frontiers in Big Data journal, based on a collection of previous
workshop papers.
4 MOTIVATION
To combat climate change and build a sustainable future, the world
must conserve resources and restore the planet. Disruptive solutions
will be needed to ensure appropriate natural resource management,
and intense consideration must be made to ensure equitable and
just distribution across socioeconomic groups. To reduce our depen-
dence on fossil fuel, development of renewable energy resources,
such as solar, wind, water and biofuel, must be accelerated. All of
these imperatives call for new research breakthroughs in relevant
branches of science and technology, and far more collaboration
across disciplines and organizations. The U.N., European and U.S.
federal agencies are enhancing efforts to ensure the security of
these critical resources, understand their interactions and address
common underlying agenda. This is evidenced by various global
initiatives such as the Stockholm Environment Institute’s "The
Water, Energy and Food Security Nexus, Solutions for the Green
Economy" conference; UK government funding programs on Food,
Energy and Water (FEW); and the NSF’s “Innovations in the Nexus
of Food, Energy and Water Systems (INFEWS)"; among many other
established and emerging programs. The Fragile Earth community
at KDD has engaged broader stakeholders through workshops and
the Earth Day organization every year since 2016.
