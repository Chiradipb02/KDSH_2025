ABSTRACT
Human events such as hospital visits, protests, and epidemic out-
breaks directly affect individuals, communities, and societies. These
events are often influenced by factors such as economics, politics,
and public policies of our society. The abundance of online data
sources such as social networks, official news articles, and personal
blogs chronicle societal events, facilitating the development of AI
models for social science, public health care, and decision making.
Human event modeling generally comprises both the forecasting
stage, which estimates future events based on historical data, and
interpretation, which seeks to identify influential factors of such
events to understand their causative attributes. Recent achieve-
ments, fueled by deep learning and the availability of public data,
have significantly advanced the field of human event modeling.
This survey offers a systematic overview of deep learning tech-
nologies for forecasting and interpreting human events, with a
primary focus on political events. We first introduce the existing
challenges and background in this domain. We then present the
problem formulation of event forecasting and interpretation. We
investigate recent achievements in graph neural networks, owing to
the prevalence of relational data and the efficacy of graph learning
models. We also discuss the latest studies that utilize large language
models for event reasoning. Lastly, we provide summaries of data
resources, open challenges, and future research directions in the
study of human event modeling.

1 INTRODUCTION
Human events can be broadly categorized into offline events (e.g.,
strikes) and online events (e.g., cyber attacks) [ 110]. Offline events
occur at specific locations and times, impacting both local communi-
ties and global society in different ways. Understanding such events
and their recurring patterns is an urgent issue for many stakehold-
ers such as investors, suppliers, and decision-makers. Modeling
such events through forecasting focuses on anticipating events in
the future based on historical event indicators as shown in Figure 1,
which is different from retrospective studies such as event detec-
tion [ 104] and summarization [ 11]. Accurate and reliable prediction
of future events is conducive to effective allocations of public re-
sources, reducing economic loss and social damage. Generally, it
can bring benefits to society and individuals, supporting effective
disaster response and socio-economic growth.
The field of human event modeling, particularly in the realm of
political event forecasting [ 20,22,23], has witnessed significant
progress over the years. Early on, researchers primarily relied on
statistical [ 68,100] and machine learning methods [ 42,58,70] to
analyze different types of data and predict future events. With the
advent of deep learning [ 49] and the availability of large amounts
of (multi-modal) data coupled with increased computational power,
there has been a notable shift towards leveraging deep learning
techniques. Many researchers have studied recurrent neural net-
works [ 33,84], and attention models [ 27], leading to substantial
advances over previous approaches.
Despite these achievements, several challenges exist in the do-
main of political event forecasting:
•Leveraging heterogeneous data. As the availability of open-
source data continues to increase, researchers have begun to
resort to heterogeneous data to develop predictive models [ 57,
85,97]. Human events occur in a dynamic social environment,
and their corresponding key information can be published in
various forms, such as traditional news reports, social media,
and government official reports. It brings unique challenges of
efficient processing and learning from heterogeneous data to
make accurate event predictions.

•Studying complex event dependencies. Human events ex-
hibit geographical properties and also have a high degree of
temporal dependency [ 111]. Modeling event contextual infor-
mation requires an in-depth investigation of the spatiotemporal
dependencies of events. Traditional methodologies have shown
limitations in modeling complex event data [ 63,84], which en-
courages the development of advanced models to address this
challenge.
•Interpreting event predictions. Most machine learning models
focus on improving predictive accuracy. However, interpreting
predicted events is an equally important task, as it can assist
practitioners in understanding prediction results and making
reasonable and practical decisions. Data-driven event prediction
models with adequate interpretability support downstream users
in event analysis and decision-making.
In recent years, there has been a surge of advanced deep learning ap-
proaches in the human event domain in response to the challenges
listed above. Graph neural networks [ 103], in particular, have at-
tracted considerable attention because of their ability to effectively
capture complex relationships and patterns inherent in event data.
The structured nature of graph data also facilitates interpretation
due to its intuitive format. Additionally, large language models
(LLMs) [ 117] have emerged as powerful tools capable of generat-
ing text, answering questions, and performing various linguistic
tasks. LLMs have begun to demonstrate effectiveness across diverse
fields [13, 43, 87], including human event forecasting [82, 109].
This survey concentrates on recent advances in graph neural
networks and language models for human event modeling. We
delve into the methodologies, benefits, and challenges associated
with these two prominent paradigms, providing a comprehensive
overview of recent progress and future directions in the field.
1.1 Previous Work and Contributions
There are several other surveys on human event predictions. Phillips
et al. [65] provided a literature review that examines the problems
and techniques for predictive analysis using social media data. Re-
cently, Zhao [110] provided a systematic survey of existing data-
driven event prediction methods, covering challenges, techniques,
applications, evaluations, and open problems. As event prediction
methods are typically motivated by specific application areas, some
surveys instead focus on event technologies in particular domains.
Ganar and Ardhapurkar [28] summarized studies of civil unrest
prediction in social media analysis based on keyword filtering.
In contrast to previous work, this survey focuses on recent ad-
vances in graph neural networks and language models specifically
in forecasting political events. Political events are influential human
events dependent on evolving social environments. The main con-
tributions of this work include (1) A systematic review of current
graph neural network models in human event modeling. These
models are categorized based on their emphasis on fundamental
graph operations or additional data enhancements. (2) A summary
of recent advancements in large language models assisting human
event prediction. (3) A comprehensive summary of data resources
that will help researchers and human experts in several ways, such
as selecting appropriate data sources for specific research needs.
(4) A discussion on ongoing challenges and prospects in the field.1.2 Outline

background information about graph neural networks and language
models. Section 3 formulates the problem of human event predic-
tion. Section 4 provides a succinct summary of early approaches,
followed by a comprehensive review of graph neural networks and
language models developed for human event forecasting. This sec-
tion also discusses interpretation methods. Section 5 summarizes
data resources related to political events. Section 6 lists open chal-
lenges and opportunities for future research directions. The survey
concludes with a summary in Section 7.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Graph Neural Networks
Graph neural networks (GNNs) aim to project elements (e.g., nodes,
edges) in a graph to a low-dimensional continuous space while
preserving graph structure and inherent properties. Such models
have gone through significant developments and have been applied
to a wide range of fields such as computer vision [ 81], natural
language processing [105], bioinformatics [71], etc.
GNNs can be categorized into spectral-based and spatial-based
models depending on the types of convolutions. Spectral-based
GNNs have graph signal filters in the spectral domain [ 73,83]. In
this line of research, Defferrard et al . [21] proposed ChebNet, which
uses K-polynomial filters in the convolutional layers for localization.
Later on, Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) [ 46] were proposed
and introduced a first-order approximation of ChebNet. Spatial-
based methods define graph convolutions based on a node’s spatial
relations [ 29,60]. In this field, the aggregation-based inductive
representation learning model (GraphSAGE) [ 35] and attention-
based graph neural network (GAT) [ 92] were proposed to effectively
learn graph representations and solve various graph-related tasks.
Some studies have attempted to extend GNNs to model hetero-
geneous graphs [ 108], which contain multiple types of nodes or
edges and have become ubiquitous in real-world scenarios (e.g.,
knowledge graphs). The relational graph convolutional network
(RGCN) [ 75] was proposed to model knowledge graphs by learn-
ing different weight matrices for each edge type. The composition-
based multi-relational graph convolutional network (CompGCN) [ 90]
was designed to embed both nodes and edges in a relational graph.
2.2 Language Models
A language model (LM) is designed to predict the probability of a
sequence of words or characters in a language. It learns the patterns
and structures of natural language by analyzing large corpora of
text data. Language models are widely used in natural language pro-
cessing tasks such as machine translation, text generation, speech
recognition, and sentiment analysis.
One of the most significant advancements in language mod-
els is the development of the transformer [ 91], which has led to
the emergence of large language models (LLMs) [ 117]. LLMs are
transformer-based language models that contain hundreds of bil-
lions (or more) parameters, trained on massive text datasets [ 80],
such as GPT-3 [ 7], PaLM [ 16] and LLaMA [ 88]. These LLMs ex-
hibit remarkable capabilities in understanding natural language
6460Advances in Human Event Modeling: From Graph Neural Networks to Language Models KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
and performing complex tasks, e.g., they excel in generating coher-
ent and contextually relevant text that closely resembles human
ability. LLMs have been explored in various domains, such as in
medicine [87], education [43], and programming [13].
3 PROBLEM FORMULATION
Event forecasting can be formulated as a supervised learning task
in machine learning, which aims at learning a function that maps
an input (e.g., a historical window of records) to an output (e.g., an
event occurrence in the future). To achieve this, the process uses
labeled training data, which includes a set of training instances.
These instances contain historical data collected before the times-
tamp of the output variable. The goal is to infer a function from this
data that can accurately predict future events. We first introduce the
preliminaries, including terminology and mathematical notation.
Historical data. Suppose there are 𝐿locations (e.g., cities, states)
of interest, and each location 𝑙can be represented by a set of fea-
tures used for prediction. We divide features into two categories,
static anddynamic.1Static features such as population and political
ideology remain constant or change slowly over a long time, while
dynamic features such as frequency of events or number of tweets
expressing “angry” emotions are updated for each time interval 𝑡
(e.g., day, week). Let S𝑙denote the set of static features of location
𝑙, andX𝑡,𝑙be the collection of dynamic features for location 𝑙at
time𝑡. The collection of dynamic features from location 𝑙within a
historical window (i.e., observing time window) with size 𝑘up to
time𝑡can be represented as X𝑡−𝑘+1:𝑡,𝑙=(X𝑡−𝑘+1,𝑙,...,X𝑡,𝑙).
Ground-truth event occurrence. A target variable Y𝑡∗,𝑙indicates
the occurrence of a future political event (e.g., civil unrest) for each
location𝑙at time𝑡∗. Note that𝑡∗can be either a time point ( 𝑡+Δ)
or a time window in the future ( 𝑡+Δ:𝑡+Δ+𝛿).Δ≥1is the
lead time that denotes the number of time steps in advance for a
prediction. We use 𝛿≥0to denote the lead time window that
represents whether an event will occur between time 𝑡+Δand
𝑡+Δ+𝛿.
time ∆Lead time  Historical windowPrediction point Lead time window/uni03B4t+/uni0394t+/uni0394+/uni03B4t*tt−k+1k
Definition 3.1. Binary event prediction. Given static and dy-
namic input features, learn a classifier 𝑓(S𝑙,X𝑡−𝑘+1:𝑡,𝑙)→Y𝑡∗,𝑙
that maps the input to a binary event variable Y𝑡∗,𝑙∈{0,1}at the
future time 𝑡∗for the target location 𝑙.
Definition 3.2. Concurrent event prediction. Given static and
dynamic input features, learn a classifier 𝑓(S𝑙,X𝑡−𝑘+1:𝑡,𝑙)→Y𝑡∗,𝑙
that maps the input to a binary vector for events Y𝑡∗,𝑙∈{0,1}𝑀at
the future time 𝑡∗for the target location 𝑙. Here,𝑀>2denotes the
number of event types that can occur concurrently (e.g., Appeal
for judicial cooperation, accuse of crime). This problem is typically
formulated as a multi-label classification task.
Fora concrete example of the problem formulation, consider
the GSR dataset [ 70] (More dataset details are in Section 5) and
1Dynamic features are usually involved in civil unrest prediction studies, while static
features are sometimes not considered.the binary event prediction task. We use the collection of 𝑛𝑡news
articles related to protest published on a given day 𝑡at city𝑙by
X𝑡,𝑙={x𝑡,1,..., x𝑡,𝑛 𝑡}where the𝑗-th news article is represented
byx𝑡,𝑗. No static features are used thus S𝑙=∅. Given the historical
window size 𝑘, the input isX𝑡−𝑘+1:𝑡,𝑙=(X𝑡−𝑘+1,𝑙,...,X𝑡,𝑙)includ-
ing news articles at city 𝑙in the previous 𝑘days up to day 𝑡. To
predict the protest on day 𝑡+Δ, the output isY𝑡+Δ,𝑙∈{0,1}.
Difference from temporal knowledge graph completion. With the
rise of heterogeneous graph neural networks [ 75,90], many re-
cent methods for human event forecasting use temporal knowl-
edge graphs (TKGs) [ 9] to enhance prediction and interpretability.
This brings the human event prediction problem close to tempo-
ral knowledge graph completion (TKGC) [ 9]. TKGC, a subfield of
knowledge graph completion (KGC) [ 40] is dedicated to predict-
ing missing links or entities in evolving knowledge graphs over
time. For instance, it seeks to predict the object (𝑠,𝑟, ?,𝑇), rela-
tion(𝑠,?,𝑜,𝑇), or subject(?,𝑟,𝑜,𝑇)using all past event quadruples
{(𝑠𝑖,𝑟𝑖,𝑜𝑖,𝑡𝑖)}𝑖,∀𝑡𝑖<𝑇. TKGC is often considered a ranking prob-
lem rather than a classification problem. While both TKGC and
human event forecasting aim to uncover patterns and dependencies
within temporal data, they have distinct objectives and methodolo-
gies. Human event forecasting specifically targets the prediction
of specific events based on temporal data sources such as news
articles [ 22,95], social media posts [ 102,111], and historical event
records [23, 30].
4 METHODOLOGY
4.1 Early Approaches
Over the years, researchers have leveraged various predictive tech-
niques for human event predictions ranging from statistical meth-
ods to more sophisticated methods such as deep neural networks.
4.1.1 Statistical methods. In a pioneering study, Radinsky and
Horvitz [68]mined chains of events from massive news archives
and proposed a probabilistic method that predicts the likelihood of
future worldwide events of interest. Manrique et al . [55] introduced
a simple threshold-based methods for forecasting civil unrest. Jin
et al. [41] characterized mass protest propagation using a bispace
diffusion model. Chen and Neill [12] explored a nonparametric
graph scan algorithm to the problem of civil unrest detection and
forecasting using heterogeneous social media graphs. Temporal
statistical models such as autoregressive [ 77,100,107] and hidden
Markov models (HMM) were also proposed [ 66,67,111] to model
political events.
4.1.2 Machine learning methods. Subsequently, people applied tra-
ditional machine learning models to civil unrest prediction, such as
random forests [ 42] and logistic regression [ 8,47,70,102,113]. Early
model based event recognition using surrogates (EMBERS) [ 58,70]
is an automated system developed for generating forecasts about
civil unrest from massive and multiple data sources. More ad-
vanced methodologies such as multi-task learning [ 30,62,112–115]
and multi-instance learning [61] were incorporated in forecasting
spatial-temporal protest events. More recently, Zhao et al . [116] pre-
sented a group-Lasso based hierarchical feature learning model to
characterize feature dependence, feature sparsity, and interactions
among missing values.

4.1.3 Early deep learning methods. A number of deep learning-
based approaches have been proposed to predict political events and
have demonstrated improved predictive capability and interpretabil-
ity. Due to the temporal nature of event occurrence, researchers
utilize variant recurrent neural networks (such as LSTM [ 38] and
GRU [ 17]) to forecast political events, which have shown supe-
rior expressiveness and power compared to autoregressive models.
Smith et al . [84] and Halkia et al . [33] applied LSTM models to pre-
dict material conflict events such as armed attacks and destruction
of property. Parrish et al . [64] studied a GRU-based multi-feature
driven approach to predict disruptive events. Meng and Srihari
[57] combines convolutional layers and LSTM layers for predicting
civil unrest. To tackle the challenges of limited predictive ability
and explainability in RNN-based approaches, researchers have in-
tegrated attention mechanisms [ 4] into RNN models. Wang et al .
[96] proposed a context-aware attention-based LSTM framework
to study different contributions of data points in the time series for
predicting civil unrest events. Attention mechanisms [ 4] were intro-
duced to dynamically highlight relevant features of the input data,
mimicking cognitive attention in humans. Such methods enhance
the important parts of input data and fade out the rest. Ertugrul
et al. [27] introduced a hierarchical attention-based spatiotemporal
learning approach for predicting future protest occurrences and
explaining feature importance.
4.2 Graph Neural Networks
There has been a surge of research focusing on studying graph
neural networks for modeling political events. To provide a com-
prehensive overview of this body of work, we categorize recent
studies into three groups based on their approach to graph learn-
ing: (1) Vanilla graph learning, which focuses solely on basic
graph operations without additional data enhancements. (2) Graph
learning with contextual information, which incorporates con-
textual data such as text summaries to enrich graph-based models.
(3)Graph learning with causal reasoning , which integrates
causal effect estimation or causal relationships to enhance inter-
pretability and accuracy. This categorization aims to offer valuable
insights into the diverse and popular methodologies used in lever-
aging graph neural networks for political event prediction.
4.2.1 Vanilla graph learning. Methods in this category primarily
concentrate on graph operations, which involve leveraging node
and/or edge embeddings as well as graph-level embedding tech-
niques. Vanilla graph learning methods for human event forecasting
typically follow four key steps:
•Graph construction. Begin by constructing a sequence of graphs
from historical event data (𝐺𝑡−𝑘+1,...,𝐺𝑡)where𝑘is the se-
quence length. 𝐺𝑡=(𝑉𝑡,𝐸𝑡)is the graph at time 𝑡with the node
set𝑉and edge set 𝐸. The graphs can be represented using ad-
jacency matrices or tuple/quadruple sets. Next, define features
for graph elements such as nodes and/or edges. For example, we
can use word embeddings for word node features at time 𝑡that
can be denoted as X𝑁×𝑑
𝑡, where𝑁=|𝑉𝑡|is the number of words
and𝑑is the feature dimension.•Graph learning. Update node and/or edge representations based
on information from neighboring nodes. For instance, the proce-
dures for updating nodes can be written as follows:
H(𝑙)
𝑡[𝑖]← AGG
∀𝑗∈N 𝑡(𝑖),∀𝑒∈𝐸𝑡(𝑗,𝑖))
EX
H(𝑙−1)
𝑡[𝑖];H(𝑙−1)
𝑡[𝑗],𝑒 
(1)
where H(𝑙)
𝑡[𝑖]is the node representation of node 𝑖at the𝑙-th
GNN layer.N𝑡(𝑖)is the set of neighboring nodes of 𝑖at time𝑡,
and𝐸𝑡(𝑖,𝑗)denotes all the edges from node 𝑗to𝑖at time𝑡. EX(·)
represents the neighbor information extractor. AGG(·) gathers the
neighborhood information of source nodes via some aggregation
operators, such as mean, sum, max, or more sophisticated pooling
and normalization functions.
•Temporal dependency learning. This step involves capturing
temporal dependencies from past events to effectively forecast
future events. Techniques commonly employed include time se-
ries analysis, recurrent neural networks, attention mechanisms,
or customized temporal methods.
•Output prediction. Use the learned node or graph representa-
tions for downstream tasks, such as predicting binary events or
concurrent events, by applying an appropriate output layer.
Following the aforementioned framework, Deng et al . [22] proposed
the first work to integrate graph learning into human events mod-
eling. This work develops a dynamic graph convolutional network
(DynamicGCN) [ 22] for predicting protest events and identifying
key context graphs to understand their progression. The graph con-
struction is achieved by an encoding method that encodes historical
news articles into a sequence of undirected and weighted semantic
word graphs, where each node is a keyword, and the weighted edge
between two words is calculated by point-wise mutual information
(PMI) [ 18]. Pre-trained word embeddings are used as initial node
features. The dynamic graph model proposed in this study consists
of novel temporal encoded features to re-encode input features for
graph convolutional layers at each time step. These features en-
compass semantic information from word nodes and learned graph
embeddings that aggregate neighboring information from previous
graphs. The graph-level embeddings, generated at the final layer,
are fed into an output layer for binary event classification.
Chen and Wang [15]proposed GasNet, a graphical and sequential
network. Instead of learning from word semantic graphs, this work
constructs dynamic event graphs comprising three primary types of
nodes: attribute, event, and date nodes. These nodes are organized
into three levels, with each previous node type pointing to the
subsequent node type, and the date node serves as the terminal
node. The graph learning is inspired by RGCN [ 75] which is the
first graph neural network designed to operate on relational graph
structures. In this approach, the representation of the date node in
the event graph is used as the feature of this date. A sequence of
date features is then fed into convolutional layers and LSTM [ 38]
for estimating civil unrest events in future days.
Yinsen et al . [106] proposed a temporal attention-based graph
sequence feature learning model (TAGS) for interpretable event
prediction. This work leverages dynamic relational event graphs
(e.g., knowledge graphs) to learn compressed graph embeddings
at different times utilizing the CompGCN [ 90]. The authors em-
ployed a temporal-aware attention mechanism inspired by the trans-
former [ 91] to capture temporal dependencies in graph sequences.
6462Advances in Human Event Modeling: From Graph Neural Networks to Language Models KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain
Given the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in handling tempo-
ral data, researchers also introduced a hierarchical attention-based
feature learning framework (HAFL) [ 98] for protest event forecast-
ing. HAFL integrates attention mechanisms at the graph structure,
node, and temporal level to enhance event prediction performance
and explanation.
4.2.2 Graph learning with contextual information. Given the vast
and diverse open-source data available today, researchers have been
actively exploring the integration of additional features to enhance
graph learning in the context of event forecasting. These additional
features provide contextual information about events and focus
on non-causal factors, contrasting with the methods discussed in
the next section. We classify the methods in this section into two
categories based on when contextual information enhancement
occurs: context in graph construction andcontext in graph learning.
Context in graph construction. Huai et al. [39] proposed a spa-
tial and temporal knowledge graph neural network (STKGN) to
explore both trans-regional influence and temporal sequencing pat-
terns. Specifically, this work introduces a novel spatial-temporal
event graph with cross-regional connection, where each region
is denoted as a node and trans-regional influences are reflected
by bidirectional edges. STKGN extracts semantics from event de-
scriptions to enhance event representations, achieved by a text
convolution procedure to learn low-dimensional vectors, inspired
by textCNN [ 14]. The approach further introduces a continuous-
time dynamic graph neural network to simulate and forecast the
evolving process of entities.
Instead of using additional textual information in graph con-
struction, Ma et al . [53] assumed the availability of external prior
knowledge, i.e., the categorical context such as Covid-19, Olympics
2016, and G20 2022 Summit. They designed a novel framework,
separation and collaboration graph disentanglement (SeCoGD) for
context-aware event forecasting. SeCoGD is a two-stage framework
including separation and collaboration. The separation stage uses
the context as prior guidance to disentangle the event graph into
multiple sub-graphs, followed by a context-specific modeling mod-
ule for capturing each context’s relational and temporal patterns.
The collaboration stage leverages hypergraphs to model the cross-
context collaborative associations, and then perform context-aware
prediction and optimization.
Context in graph learning. Deng et al . [23] proposed Glean, a
graph learning framework based on event knowledge graphs to in-
corporate both relational and word contexts. The proposed method
is for predicting concurrent events of multiple types and event
participants. The authors utilized event tuples and corresponding
text summaries for graph construction and learning. For example,
(Citizen ,Criticizes, Government , 02/26/2015) with description “A
Politician attacked the state government on various fronts such as
fertilizer crunch and land acquisition act.”. The authors construct
temporal event knowledge graphs built upon a sequence of event
sets in ascending time order, and a sequence of word graphs using
text summaries. The model uses GCN [ 46] and CompGCN [ 90] to
learn node embeddings from event knowledge graphs and semantic
word graphs, respectively at each historical timestamp. To leverage
the rich information encompassed in event texts, a context-aware
embedding fusion module is proposed to enhance representationsof nodes and edges in event knowledge graphs by blending embed-
dings of contextual word nodes. The fusion procedures are achieved
through attention [ 52]. The enhanced representations of nodes and
edges, as well as node embeddings of word graphs are then aggre-
gated (e.g., pooling) and fed into a recurrent neural network for final
event prediction. This approach can also infer the potential partici-
pants of the event of interest, providing additional information on
the event prediction.
Deng et al . [24] introduced a contextualized multilevel feature
learning framework (CMF) for event prediction and explanation by
leveraging diverse contextual information in events. This approach
models features ranging from coarse to refined granularity, includ-
ing event frequencies, documents, and event graphs for a historical
window denoted as {x,𝐷,𝐺}𝑡−𝑘+1:𝑡. The approach hierarchically
models heterogeneous data, capturing dependencies between dif-
ferent data types by propagating signals from higher-level (coarser)
features to lower-level (refined) ones. Each type of feature is mod-
eled at one level and then integrated into the next level. The authors
also proposed an event explainer to provide post-hoc temporal and
multi-level explanations for the prediction model.
Most work is based on the Markov assumption that the probabil-
ity of an event is only influenced by the state of its last time step (or
recent history). Han and Ning [37] proposed a text-enriched graph
learning model, MTG, that takes into account multiple temporal
granularities beyond just recent events. The authors proposed inte-
grating news texts as auxiliary features during graph learning. The
proposed framework consists of a cache module to learn medium-
term tendencies from past events and news texts, a memory module
to learn long-term statistics from past events and cached memories,
as well as a dynamic CompGCN module to capture short-term trig-
gers through interactions among entities and the corresponding
auxiliary news texts.
4.2.3 Graph learning with causal reasoning. Causal reasoning is a
promising direction for improving prediction accuracy and inter-
pretability in event forecasting [ 32]. Unlike conventional machine
learning methods that primarily focus on capturing correlations and
patterns within data, models integrating causal reasoning mech-
anisms aim to discern causal relationships and/or causal effects
among various factors. Explicitly modeling causal dependencies
can offer deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms driving
events, enabling more robust and interpretable predictions. In this
section, we discuss recent studies in graph learning with causal
reasoning. Existing methods typically perform causal reasoning
before the prediction stage, i.e., using a two-stage approach.
Deng et al . [26] proposed a novel framework CAPE, which in-
corporates causal inference into the prediction of future event oc-
currences in a spatiotemporal environment. CAPE presents a novel
causal inference model to estimate conducts individual treatment
effect (ITE) [ 79] from observational event data with spatiotem-
poral attributes. The learned event-related causal information is
then incorporated into event prediction as prior knowledge. The
prior causal knowledge (e.g., the estimated ITEs) is injected into
the event forecasting stage via a feature reweighting module and
an approximate constraint loss. The proposed method is validated
on real-world event datasets by integrating learned causal prior
knowledge into different base models for event forecasting.

Another study investigated the causal relationship between
event occurrences and news topics. Researchers extracted topics
from event-related documents and represented them as probability
distributions of words [ 25]. They then introduced a causal discov-
ery approach based on propensity score matching (PSM) [ 10] to
discover evolving causal topics that causally impact future events
from observational data. Such topics, together with words and docu-
ments are represented as nodes with changing edges in the dynamic
heterogeneous graphs. The authors then proposed a dynamic het-
erogeneous graph model with causality-enhanced node represen-
tation, HGC [ 25] for forecasting civil unrest. To address temporal
dependencies in dynamic graphs, they introduced a novel temporal
information learning module that updates node representations
based on their evolving context and heterogeneous semantics.
4.2.4 Advantages and limitations. GNN-based models can capture
intricate interactions and dependencies in complex event data,
thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. However, the computa-
tional demands for training GNNs on massive graphs pose scala-
bility challenges, when considering the vast volume of event data.
GNN models may also encounter difficulties in generalizing to un-
seen graphs [ 51]. This limitation can impede their ability to capture
relevant patterns or dependencies in unfamiliar event contexts,
such as underrepresented regions with limited training data.
4.3 Large Language Models
Large language models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant
attention across various fields. These advanced models, capable of
generating coherent and contextually relevant text, offer unique
opportunities for extracting insights from vast amounts of textual
data sourced from news articles, social media posts, and other
textual sources. Researchers have started to explore LLMs for event
predictive tasks. Next, we explore the burgeoning field of utilizing
LLMs for human event forecasting, recognizing LLMs as valuable
tools within the event forecasting pipeline.
In recent work, Shi et al . [82] investigated the capabilities of
prompting large language models (e.g., GPT-3.5) in reasoning about
real-world events. The authors proposed LAMP, a framework that
integrates an LLM in event prediction. In the framework, an event
sequence model first proposes predictions (e.g., what events will
happen?). Then, a large language model suggests cause events,
which will pattern-match against actual previous events and re-
trieve the most relevant. In the end, a neural model learns to assign
high scores to the proposed predictions that are strongly supported
by the retrieved evidence. LAMP has been demonstrated to outper-
form state-of-the-art event sequence models on real-world datasets
significantly.
Ma et al . [54] explored LLMs in a different way for human event
modeling. They introduced a novel formulation for structured, com-
plex, and time-complete temporal event (SCTc-TE), along with a
simple and fully automated pipeline for constructing such SCTcTEs
from a large amount of news articles. A key step in this pipeline
is entity extraction, where the authors employed LLMs for entity
extraction in a zero-shot paradigm. Specifically, they took open-
sourced Vicuna-13b for entity extraction and used GPT-4 for en-
tity linking to merge the same entities. The LLM-based event con-
struction method shows promise in replacing rule-based extractionsystems and human-annotated processes. In addition, the authors
propose a novel model, named LoGo [ 54], that leverages both local
and global contexts for event forecasting based on SCTcTE.
Zhang and Ning [109] proposed two event forecasting tasks: ob-
ject prediction and multi-event forecasting and presented a unified
framework LEAF that uses LLMs to simplify the design of temporal
event predictions.
4.3.1 Advantages and limitations. LLMs provide powerful tools for
human event forecasting by extracting insights and performing
reasoning from textual data. However, the answers from LLMs may
lack factuality [ 93] and causality [ 45], as they generate responses
based on statistical patterns rather than explicit knowledge. While
LLMs have advantages in capturing linguistic nuances and con-
textual information, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of their
outputs remains a challenge. Therefore, it is essential to critically
evaluate LLM outputs in event forecasting applications.
4.4 Interpretation in Human Event Forecasting
Interpretation is crucial in human event forecasting, as it helps
illuminate the underlying mechanisms driving predictions and pro-
vides actionable insights for decision-makers. We categorize the ex-
isting literature on event interpretation methods into three groups:
post-hoc non-trainable precursor discovery, dedicated explanation
models andlanguage model-driven reasoning.
4.4.1 Post-hoc non-trainable precursor discovery. In this category,
researchers have used separate methods to uncover clues of pre-
dicted events after the forecasting process [ 22,98,106]. These clues
are extracted from historical data often using learned model weights
to identify important elements, such as keywords and documents.
Deng et al . [22] proposed a heuristic subgraph extraction to help
explain event prediction results. It first extracts the important nodes
from the trained model and then construct the subgraph of the in-
put dynamic graph. Other researchers [ 98,106] proposed to analyze
subgraphs associated with important dates, thus potential clues
affecting event occurrence can be mined. They used the product of
attention values and the weights of MLP layers to identify the top-k
important historical time steps. They then searched for subgraphs
corresponding to high-frequency protest participants.
4.4.2 Dedicated explanation models. Such approaches employ sep-
arate trainable procedures to identify significant event precursors.
Researchers introduced a separate multi-actor prediction model
to estimate potential actors involved in the predicted event, given
its relevant historical data [ 23], and a post-hoc multi-level event
explanation module to extract relevant news articles and historical
events related to predicted events via learning important feature
masks [24].
4.4.3 Language model-driven reasoning. Some researchers have
harnessed the powerful capabilities of LLMs for explaining event
predictions. Shi et al . [82] proposed a method that first estimates the
causes of predicted events using LLMs, followed by matching these
causes with historical events to provide explanations. Although
studies in this category are currently limited, it is anticipated that
it will attract increased research efforts in the future.

5 DATA RESOURCES
We summarize data sources commonly used in human event studies,
especially for political events. These data serve as the ground truth
for event occurrences. Historical events are key indicators of future
events. We also discuss external indicators used as historical input
data for predicting events.
5.1 Event Data
Since the last century, various event data projects with different
data collection, coding, and analysis processes have emerged. We
organize political event data in Table 1. According to the coding
process of event data, we divide these data into human-coded and
machine-coded data. Human-coded data depend on human research
teams with specific knowledge of the local context, while machine-
coded data rely entirely on automated event encoding systems.
5.1.1 Human-encoded events. Many human-coded event datasets
have been developed and maintained, which allow researchers to
build forecasters at specific sub-state geographic units [ 57,77,100].
In the earliest days, due to technological limitations (i.e., the lack
of electronic articles and computational power), the World Event
Interaction Survey (WEIS) [ 56] and the Conflict and Peace Data
Bank (COPDAB) [ 3] projects hire human analysts to physically
collect newspaper clippings, press reports, and summary accounts
from Western news sources to obtain news stories. These projects
focus on daily international and domestic events or interactions.
Later, there were more event data projects focused on specific
areas. The Social, Political, Economic Event Database (SPEED)
Project [ 59] is a technology-intensive effort to extract event data
from a global archive of news reports covering the Post WWII era.
Salehyan et al .developed the Social Conflict in Africa Database
(SCAD) [ 72], which contains instances of protests, riots, strikes, gov-
ernment repression, communal violence, and other forms of unrest
that happened mainly in Africa. The Gold Standard Report (GSR)
is a collection of human-classified civil unrest news reports from
the most influential newspaper outlets in Latin America [ 70]. The
Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) [ 69] col-
lects the dates, actors, locations, fatalities, and types of all reported
political events (e.g., violence, protests) around the world. Urdal
and Hoelscher [89] introduced an event dataset on urban unrest at
the city level that covers 55 major cities in Asia and Sub-Saharan
African countries.
Some datasets focus on violent events motivated by political
grievances. Daly [19] collected violent events at the municipality-
month level in Colombia. The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) [ 48]
provides information on domestic and international terrorist at-
tacks around the world. The Konstanz One-Sided Event Dataset
(KOSVED) [ 76] provides detailed information on the magnitude
and locations of one-sided violent events in 20 civil wars. The Upp-
sala Conflict Data Program Georeferenced Event Dataset (UCDP
GED) [ 86] is an event dataset that classifies three types of organized
violence (state-based conflict, non-state conflict, and one-sided vio-
lence) both spatially and temporally.
5.1.2 Machine-encoded events. Manual approaches began to be re-
placed with automated coding with the first iteration of the Kansas
event data set (KEDS) [ 78] project in the late 1980s. KEDS usesthe automated coding of English-language news reports to gen-
erate political event data. These data are used in statistical early
warning models to predict political changes. The Integrated Crisis
Early Warning System (ICEWS) [ 6] includes a database of political
events with global coverage. Similar to ICEWS, the Global Dataset
of Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT) [ 50] has been developed
and compiled a comprehensive list of electronic news sources. Both
GDELT and ICEWS are active automatic systems that identify and
classify events from public data following the Conflict and Me-
diation Event Observations (CAMEO) [ 31] which is a framework
for coding event data. These two datasets have been extensively
studied in various fields. Some researchers compared ICEWS with
GDELT [ 2,94,99] and pointed out limitations on local conflict
processes that rely too heavily on machine-coded data [ 33,36].
The Historical Phoenix Event Data [ 1] includes events extracted
from The New York Times, BBC Monitoring’s Summary of World
Broadcasts, and the CIA’s Foreign Broadcast Information Service.
It also uses the CAMEO methodology to encode events. Given the
large scale and extensive spatial coverage of machine-coded data,
many researchers have used machine-coded event data to build
forecasts for political eventst [ 22,24–26,30,53,62,66,67,107,112–
115]. There is also an emerging trend in using LLMs for event
encoding [ 54], driven by their superior linguistic comprehension
compared to rule-based machine encoding methods, and their effi-
ciency in saving human effort compared to manual encoding.
5.2 External Event Indicators
Researchers also incorporate public media data as input features
for human event forecasting. Such data is known as Open Source
Indicators (OSI). OSI includes traditional media data such as digital
newspapers, blogs, and social media data such as posts from Twitter
and Facebook. These data provide a wealth of background informa-
tion that helps one understand the social context and public opinion
of political events. Economic indicators and other meta-data sources
have also been explored in this line of research. Studies show that ex-
ogenous political and economic variables can serve as the necessary
underlying drivers of political events besides social media [ 57,101].
Social and economic features derived from the World Develop-
ment Indicators (WDI) [ 5] and Worldwide Governance Indicators
(WGI) [ 44] have been investigated [ 64]. Researchers have also uti-
lized Google Trends (GT) to uncover social dynamics associated
with behavior that precedes episodes of civil unrest [ 55]. Google
Trends analyzes the popularity of top search queries in Google
Search across various regions and languages.
6 OPEN CHALLENGES AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
Data dynamics, sufficiency, and reliability. Data-driven ap-
proaches for human event prediction depend heavily on data qual-
ity, making them subject to several data challenges. The dynamic
nature of data is one of the main challenges. For text data, language,
vocabulary, and mainstream slang are constantly evolving. In geo-
graphic data, location names and area boundaries may change due
to major political events. The sufficiency of data is another chal-
lenge. Researchers have investigated various external data sources
in addition to historical event occurrences to improve the accuracy

of predictions. Collecting external data from multiple sources and
distinguishing correlated data from noisy data is expensive in terms
of time, material, and computational costs. Moreover, the spatial
scarcity of human events will also hinder event prediction studies
in underrepresented areas. Data reliability is also a fundamental is-
sue in forecasting problems. Missing or incorrect data often occurs
during manual or automated data collection. For example, auto-
mated event collection systems may lose events due to unexpected
network failures. Social media posts provide valuable resources for
tracking user behavior and social activities. However, such data
include typos, chit-chat, and misinformation that can mislead pre-
dictive models. Hence, over-reliance on data can make prediction
models vulnerable to real-world applications.
Unfaithful explanations. While explainable models have emerged
to improve model transparency and assist in decision-making, en-
suring the faithfulness of event explanations remains a challenge.
When explanations provided by interpretable models fail to reflect
the true underlying factors driving predictions accurately, they can
lead to misinterpretations and erroneous conclusions. This lack of
faithfulness may arise due to various reasons, including oversim-
plification of complex relationships, biases in the training data, or
limitations in the interpretability techniques themselves. Language
models (LLMs) offer promise in this regard, with their ability to
generate coherent and contextually relevant text. However, lever-
aging LLMs for event prediction requires careful consideration of
their limitations (e.g., hallucinations and reliability).
Causality study in human events. There have been advance-
ments in human event prediction that leverage estimated causal
information to enhance event prediction [ 25,26]. However, there
remains a significant gap in deeply mining the underlying causalmechanisms driving event occurrences. More advanced approaches
that delve into understanding the intricate causal relationships
among various factors for human events are expected. By gaining
deeper insights into the causal structure underlying human events,
it becomes possible to develop more robust and accurate predic-
tive models capable of capturing the true causal drivers of events,
thereby advancing the field of human event forecasting
7 CONCLUSION
In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of current meth-
ods for human event modeling, with a particular emphasis on graph
neural networks and language models. We outline the existing
challenges in human event prediction, summarize recent research
papers, and discuss both traditional and advanced predictive tech-
niques studied for human events. Additionally, we offer an extensive
overview of available data resources. At the end, we highlight open
challenges and propose promising avenues for future investigation.
With the emergence of large language models, which are changing
the problem space, we anticipate a surge of research in this domain.
We believe our survey offers a valuable overview for researchers,
driving new ideas for future endeavors.
