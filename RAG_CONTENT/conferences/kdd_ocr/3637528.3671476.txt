ABSTRACT
The digital advertising field has always had challenging ML prob-
lems, learning from petabytes of data that is highly imbalanced,
reactivity times in the milliseconds, and more recently compounded
with the complex user’s path to purchase across devices, across
platforms, and even online/real-world behavior. The AdKDD work-
shop continues to be a forum for researchers in advertising, during
and after KDD. Our website which hosts slides and abstracts re-
ceives approximately 2,000 monthly visits and 1,800 active users
during the KDD 2021. In surveys during AdKDD 2019 and 2020,
over 60% agreed that AdKDD is the reason they attended KDD, and
over 90% indicated they would attend next year. The 2024 edition is
particularly timely because of the increasing application of Graph-
based NN and Generative AI models in advertising. Coupled with
privacy-preserving initiatives enforced by GDPR, CCPA the future
of computational advertising is at an interesting crossroads. For
this edition, we plan to solicit papers that span the spectrum of
deep user understanding while remaining privacy-preserving. In
addition, we will seek papers that discuss fairness in the context of
advertising, to what extent does hyper-personalization work, and
whether the ad industry as a whole needs to think through more
effective business models such as incrementality. We have hosted
several academic and industry luminaries as keynote speakers and
have found our invited speaker series hosting expert practitioners
to be an audience favorite. We will continue fielding a diverse set
of keynote speakers and invited talks for this edition as well. As
with past editions, we hope to motivate researchers in this space to
think not only about the ML aspects but also to spark conversations
about the societal impact of online advertising.

1 INTRODUCTION
In 2023, the average worldwide internet user spent on average 6.5
hours daily across all devices interacting with online content al-
most entirely sponsored by advertisements. At almost $700B global
market size in 2024, and expected to pass $830B by 2026, digital ad-
vertising has already surpassed traditional ads in global spend and
continues to grow despite economic headwinds. Digital advertising
and in particular computational advertising is perhaps the most
visible and ubiquitous application of machine learning and one that
interacts directly with consumers. When done right, ads connect
us to opportunities to enrich our lives and creep us out when done
badly. Recently at the forefront of political battles between gov-
ernments, large multinational corporations, and consumers, digital
advertising remains a dynamic industry and research area.
Looking at the published literature over the last few years, many
researchers might consider computational advertising as a mature
field. Yet, the opposite is true. Computational advertising is evolving
from simple rule-based ads controlled by monolithic publishers
and randomly rotating banner ads to highly personalized content
experiences within native, video, and display formats on mobile
devices, connected TV, and audio – all utilizing data amassed from
petabytes of stored user data collected increasingly through inferred
identity providers. The increasing use of sequence models and the
rise of Generative AI is spawning new directions such as the auto-
generation of ad creatives or pay-for-use shopping assistants. Ads
are far from done.
The AdKDD workshops held in conjunction with KDD confer-
ences in the past years (2017-2023) continue to generate interest
from academia and industry as one of the top venues specifically
for advertising research. We believe this is a unique forum for folks
interested in aspects of digital advertising to get together, exchange
notes and get a pulse for the state of the art, especially in the indus-
try. We have also had several inquiries on whether we would repeat
this workshop for 2024 and are confident we will have an engaged
and productive workshop session. Although we have considered
creating a separate conference dedicated to advertising, we believe
KDD is still the best venue for our attendees.

2 WORKSHOP TOPICS
The workshop focuses on three main aspects of computational
advertising, discussed below.
Evolution of computational advertising : Online advertising
has progressed beyond the notion of traditional desktop ads to ads
that are native, social, mobile, and contextual. In tandem, the rise of
new mechanisms, such as header bidding, complex ad exchanges,
repeated auctions, ad blockers, viewability trackers, and others,
as well as new technologies such as generative AI, challenge the
traditional notions of advertising. Controversial issues in advertis-
ing continue to exist such as privacy, security, fraud, ethics, and
economic attribution. We invite papers that are focused on some of
the above aspects.
Large-scale and novel ad targeting : Recent advances in real-
time, big data systems, and easier accessibility to different types of
data make it possible to design more personalized and efficient ad
targeting systems. We invite papers that advance the state-of-the-
art in related areas of ad targeting.
Deployed systems & battle scars: We particularly encourage
papers that highlight experience in deploying real-time ad targeting
systems, data and audience insights, as well as position papers on
the future of online advertising.
3 PAST WORKSHOPS
There have been a total of seventeen AdKDD and TargetAd work-
shops to date, organized every year since 2007, which focused on
highlighting state-of-the-art advances in computational advertising.
All the workshops were well attended, often with standing room
only, and very well received both by the academic community and
the advertising industry. For the 2023 edition held in Long Beach,
CA we had 100+ attendees, as well as 100 YouTube views on average
per each recorded presentation.
