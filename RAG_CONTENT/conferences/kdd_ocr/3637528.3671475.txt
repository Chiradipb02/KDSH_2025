Abstract
With the advent of Bitcoin, a cryptographically-enabled peer-to-
peer digital payment system, blockchain together with a whole
package of distributed ledger technologies, which serve as the un-
derlying foundation of all the crypto-currencies, have been gaining
attention from both academia and industry in the last fifteen years.
The recent years have witnessed tremendous momentum in the
development of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies,
largely due to the impressive rise in the market capital of these
digital tokens. More and more industries, from banking and insur-
ance, to supply chain and e-commerce, are quickly realizing the
great potential in blockchain technology in efficiency boost, process
automation and secure data sharing across otherwise isolated data
silos. Furthermore, as the recognition of the data value began to
sink in, data assets has become an essential part of the development
of enterprises and countries. Blockchain technology is regarded
as the foundation of digital economy and provides an effective ap-
proach for data ownership, pricing and transactions, which are the
core issues of data asset management. However, the potential impli-
cations of Blockchain technologies go far beyond their application
as the technological backbone for cryptocurrencies. Web3.0, using
blockchain as underlying technology, allow for various novel appli-
cation scenarios, which are built upon distributed consensus and
thus are hard to block or censor while providing public verifiability
of peer-to-peer transactions without a trusted central party. Web3.0
are expected to become the main front for a plethora of highly
expressive applications. To more thoroughly explore the potential
of blockchain and web3.0 and promote their progress, SDBD’24
will provide a forum for the most recent blockchain and web3.0
research, innovations, and applications, bridging the gap between
theory and practice in the design.

1 INTRODUCTION
Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable parties who do not
fully trust one another to maintain a set of global states. The parties
agree on the existence, values, and histories of the states. Most
attention and research so far have been devoted to the underlying
technologies from the database, distributed architecture, cryptogra-
phy and consensus aspects, primarily because the priority as yet
has been attached to the feasibility, stability and scalability of the
platforms. Yet, as it has been gaining increasing awareness that the
greatest potential of blockchain and distributed technologies lies in
unleashing a whole new economy empowered by the capabilities
to convert a rich class of emerging class of virtual assets into attrib-
utable value, including a long list of promising new concepts such
as influence, social capital, swarm intelligence, personal data and
credit. How to bring the greatest value out of the various types of
new “on-chain” data in the blockchain setting becomes an urgent
task. Furthermore, how to manage, organize and optimize these
“on-chain” data, and extract the maximum value possible from it
arouses particular interests. Consequently, it is both important and
challenging to explore a wealth of interesting new research topics
in this new setting that fall broadly under the scope of KDD yet
with the unique requirement to achieve the optimal balance among
data utility, security and privacy.
KDD, as the leading venue for data mining, knowledge discovery
and artificial intelligence, should take the lead in this promising
new domain. The workshop aims to provide a venue at SIGKDD
for developers, practitioners, and researchers from different back-
ground to discuss how the unique properties of blockchain and
distributed ledger that benefit current and future applications, par-
ticular from the perspective of integrating data mining, analysis
and intelligence into the underlying framework. To best integrate
with KDD community and scope, we have proposed the special

theme of “Smart Data” to highlight the mission and focus of this
workshop.
2 PAST WORKSHOPS
This series of workshop has been successfully held for four ses-
sions. SDBD’19 and SDBD’20, were a huge success at SIGKDD’19
and SIGKDD’20. All participants enjoyed the keynotes, the pa-
per presentations as well as the panel discussions. Some partici-
pants expressed their strong interests in the future workshop in
the series and showed interests in submitting papers. The high
passion and strong enthusiasm we felt from the participants fur-
ther confirmed our belief that the KDD community is all ready to
embrace blockchain and distributed ledger technology to advance
new themes that lie at the frontier of smart data intelligence. So we
expanded the half-day workshop to a full-day event, KDD Trust
Day 2021 at SIGKDD’21, and KDD Special Day 2023 - AI for open
society at SIGKDD’23, which achieved great attention and success.
