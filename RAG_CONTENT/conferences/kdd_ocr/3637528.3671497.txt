ABSTRACT
KDD AIDSH 2024 aims to foster discussions and developments that
push the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Sci-
ence (DS) in healthcare, enhance diagnostic accuracy and promote
human-centric approaches to healthcare, thus stimulating future
interdisciplinary collaborations. This year’s symposium will focus
on expanding the application of AI/DS in healthcare/medicine and
bridging existing gaps. The workshop invites submissions of full
papers as well as work-in-progress on the application of AI/DS
in healthcare. The workshop will feature three invited talks from
eminent speakers, spanning academia, industry, and clinical re-
searchers. In addition, selected papers will be invited to publish
in Health Data Science, a Science Partner Journal. This summary
provides a brief description of the half-day workshop to be held on
August 26th, 2024. The webpage for the workshop can be found at

1 DESCRIPTION
In the fields of healthcare and medicine research, the fusion of
AI and DS has brought unprecedented innovation to this tradi-
tional domain. This integration has demonstrated its potential in
multiple aspects, including but not limited to medical imaging anal-
ysis, diagnostic decision support, drug discovery, and personalized
healthcare. Utilizing AI and DS, the healthcare field has achieved
significant advancements in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and
treatment efficiency. Despite the promising outlook, “AI and Data
6720

Science for Healthcare” still faces several key gaps and challenges
in realizing its full potential:
•Importance of Data-Centric AI (DCAI): Traditionally, AI
development has focused on optimizing model design to accom-
modate fixed datasets, often overlooking inherent data flaws
such as missing values, incorrect labels, and outliers. This raises
a critical issue: whether improvements in various model perfor-
mances genuinely reflect the model’s actual potential or merely
result from overfitting the datasets. Medical professionals and
researchers typically emphasize the importance of large-scale,
high-quality datasets for generating reliable and broadly applica-
ble medical insights, highlighting the necessity of implementing
Data-Centric AI (DCAI).
•Advancing People-Centric Healthcare (PCHC): Although
advancements in AI and DS have provided people with more
access to healthcare information, these technologies have not
sufficiently encouraged active participation. Existing healthcare
information systems lack interactivity and user-friendliness,
restricting people’s ability to proactively track, manage, and
share their healthcare data. Therefore, developing interactive
and user-friendly people-centric AI technologies and provid-
ing corresponding data education and support are crucial for
realizing People-Centric Healthcare (PCHC).
•Promoting PCHC through DCAI Integration: A lack of
interoperability among healthcare IT systems and a unified stan-
dard for data exchange limits the effective use of Data-Centric
AI in People-Centric Healthcare. The diversity of data formats
and standards impedes data sharing and analysis, restricting
the ability to provide comprehensive and coordinated care. To
promote the effective merger of Data-Centric AI and People-
Centric Healthcare, there is an urgent need to develop and adopt
unified data standards. Effectively integrating data from various
sources, including clinical data, people-provided information,
and real-time healthcare monitoring data, to support personal-
ized medicine remains a significant challenge.
•Facilitating DCAI with Insights from PCHC: AI models have
shown tremendous potential in improving the accuracy of med-
ical diagnoses and treatment decisions. However, these models
are often seen as “black boxes” with insufficient explainability,
which poses a barrier to building trust in AI-driven decisions
among people and healthcare providers. Enhancing the explain-
ability of models and ensuring that both people and medical
professionals can understand the recommendations made by AI
is crucial for advancing people-centric AI applications.
The overarching goal of this workshop is to grow the AI/DS for
Healthcare/Medicine communities and bridge these gaps.
We aim to discuss scientific advances and thoughtful views gen-
erated from collaboration between healthcare professionals and
experts in the fields of artificial intelligence and data science, further
promoting the integration and development of DCAI and PCHC.
We especially focus on efforts that have the potential to translate
the value of healthcare data for the benefit of people’s healthcare
and the population’s well-being.2 WORKSHOP OVERVIEW
This half-day workshop consists of 3 invited talks, 6 contributed
talks, and 1 poster session. Furthermore, selected papers will be
invited to publish in Health Data Science, a Science Partner Journal.
Invited talks (3 ×25 min Talk + 3 ×5 min QA). We selected
invited speakers from academia, industry, and clinical research
organizations on various aspects about the state of the art of AI, in
health along with real-world.
Contributed talks (10 min ×6). The top six submissions for
Original Research will be invited for podium talks.
Poster sessions (60 min ×1). All accepted submissions will be
offered an opportunity to present their work through a poster.
