ABSTRACT  
Once a very large payment processor client told us: ‘if we are 
down for 5 minutes, we open the evening news - so don ’t screw 
up’. Processing billions of dollars per day, many financial 
institutions, need to continuously fight organized crime in the 
form of transaction fraud, stolen cards, anti -money laundering, 
account opening fraud, impersonations scams, phishing, and 
many other e xotic and ever changing attacks from organized 
crime groups worldwide. In fact, it is estimated that in 2023 the 
global losses in fraud scams and bank fraud reached $485.6 
billion. However, in addition to having very good detection rates 
and very low false  positive rates, financial institutions also need 
to maintain very high availability rates, very low latencies, very 
high throughputs, automatic fault tolerance, auto scale up and 
down, and more. In this talk we cover some lessons related to 
running ML mod els in harsh, mission critical environments. We 
describe data issues, scale issues, ethical issues, system issues, 
security issues, compliance issues, business and regulation issues, 
and some architectural tradeoffs and architectural evolutions.
