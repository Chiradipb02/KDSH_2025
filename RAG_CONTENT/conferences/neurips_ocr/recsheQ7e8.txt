Abstract
Although humans inherently have diverse values, current large language model
(LLM) alignment methods often assume that aligning LLMs with the general pub-
lic’s preferences is optimal. A major challenge in adopting a more individualized
approach to LLM alignment is its lack of scalability , as it involves repeatedly
acquiring preference data and training new reward models and LLMs for each
individual’s preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm
where users specify what they value most within the system message , steering the
LLM’s generation behavior to better align with the user’s intentions. However, a
naive application of such an approach is non-trivial since LLMs are typically trained
on a uniform system message ( e.g., “You are a helpful assistant”), which limits
their ability to generalize to diverse, unseen system messages. To improve this
generalization, we create MULTIFACETED COLLECTION , augmenting 66k user in-
structions into 197k system messages through hierarchical user value combinations.
Using this dataset, we train a 7B LLM called JANUS and test it on 921 prompts
from 5 benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0, FLASK, Koala, MT-Bench, and Self-Instruct)
by adding system messages that reflect unseen user values. JANUS achieves tie+win
rate of 75.2%, 72.4%, and 66.4% against Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, GPT-3.5 Turbo,
and GPT-4, respectively. Unexpectedly, on three benchmarks focused on response
helpfulness (AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, Arena Hard Auto v0.1), JANUS also
outperforms LLaMA 3 8B Instruct by a +4.0%p, +0.1%p, +3.0%p margin, un-
derscoring that training with a vast array of system messages could also enhance
alignment to the general public’s preference as well. Our code, dataset, benchmark,
and models are available at https://lklab.kaist.ac.kr/Janus/ .
1 Introduction
Post-training techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or instruction
fine-tuning are effective at enhancing the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human
preferences [ 4,5,6,33,56,61]. These methods involve collecting preference data based on high-level
values that many people agree upon, such as helpfulness and harmlessness, and then using this data
to train reward models (RMs) and LLMs. However, human preferences cannot simply be categorized
into such binary divisions; they are typically diverse and exhibit nuanced variations according to
different people and contexts [ 8,30,31,36,38,39,40,74,84]. As a result, a significant amount
of data is created without considering the conflicting preferences that individuals may have, which
results in annotation disagreement [ 21,87,90]. Training LLMs on generic, unattributed preference
data inadvertently leads to undesirable traits like verbosity [69].

ness and harmlessness. We propose training LLMs with diverse system messages, each representing
an individual’s multifaceted preferences, to generalize to unseen system messages. The resulting
model, J ANUS 7B, is adept at generating personalized responses for personalized system messages.
To address these issues, a new paradigm called personalized RLHF has been proposed. In this
paradigm, RMs or LLMs are trained to reflect individual preferences, aiming to model the diverse
preferences that people may have [ 7,8,25,38,42,84]. However, prior works require collecting data
that reflects fine-grained preferences each time and then re-training the RMs and LLMs. Considering
that the size of LLMs used in production is steadily increasing, this method may not be highly
scalable in terms of time, storage cost, and training cost [37, 67].
In this paper, we pose the following question: Can we align to diverse preferences without the need to
re-train the LLM for each user’s preferences? Drawing inspiration from how pretrain-then-finetune
evolved to handle unseen tasks without re-training via instruction fine-tuning [ 55,77,83], we explore
to adapt to user preference without re-training. Specifically, we examine how explicitly stating
the user’s preference as meta-instructions in the form of system messages can guide the LLM’s
behavior to align with the user’s intentions [ 79]. However, in our early experiments, we observed that
open-source LLMs, unlike proprietary LLMs, do not possess this ability. We hypothesize that this is
because open-source LLMs are typically trained with a generic system message, such as “You are a
helpful assistant” [ 8,9,23,92,94]. Consequently, their ability to incorporate new, unseen system
message is limited. To address this, we propose training LLMs on diverse system messages, allowing
the LLM to adapt to novel preferences during test time.
To acquire sufficiently diverse and multifaceted values that control individual preferences, we devise
a hierarchical synthesis of user values from high-level dimensions. Verbalizing combinations of user
values into system messages, we create a training dataset of 197k system messages, MULTIFACETED
COLLECTION . For each instruction, there are three variants of system messages embedded with non-
overlapping values, along with respective responses. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses,
we show that the dataset encompasses a variety of preferences.
To test if our strategy helps aligning to various system messages, we train Mistral 7B v0.2 [ 26] on
theMULTIFACETED COLLECTION and obtain JANUS 7B. In addition, we augment 315 instructions
across 5 LLM benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 [ 13], FLASK [ 88], Koala [ 17], MT-Bench [ 92], and Self-
Instruct [ 82]) with three unseen context-specific system messages verified by humans per instruction,
creating 921 unseen system messages. Human evaluation demonstrates that JANUS achieve a 74.8%,
70.8%, and 57.9% win rate compared to Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125, and GPT-
4-Turbo-0125, respectively. GPT-4 evaluation results show similar trends, where JANUS achieves
an average score of 4.24 out of 5.0, outperforming LLaMA 3 8B Instruct, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct
v0.1, and GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125 by 5.7% on average. Surprisingly, when assessing the helpfulness of
the response on 3 benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 [ 13], MT-Bench [ 92], Arena Hard Auto v0.1 [ 41]),
JANUS outperforms LLaMA 3 8B Instruct by a +4.0%p, +0.1%p, and +0.3%p margin, suggesting that
training on diverse system messages enhances both individualized and general alignment. Further
analyses reveal that explicit exposure to diverse preferences during training is crucial, ensuring robust
performance even without system messages at test time.

Personalized RLHF for aligning to diverse preferences As humans exhibit varying preferences
and values for a single task, it is essential to develop systems capable of representing diverse
perspectives [ 32,72,73,86]. A majority of studies build on the RLHF pipeline, designing customized
reward functions to prevent rewarding individualized outputs in a one-size-fits-all manner. To address
this issue, a recent stream of research has focused on modeling the distribution of human preferences
embedded in annotated data and subsequently calibrating the reward model to align with these
preferences [ 38,71,80]. These studies aim to reduce annotation disagreements by more accurately
simulating the views of a target population. Another line of research highlights the insufficiency of
a single reward model and focuses on learning a mixture of preference distributions [ 7], training
individual reward models signaling a specific preference [ 8], or jointly training a separate user model
and reward model on user information and user preference data [ 42]. To obtain Pareto-optimal
generalization across a spectrum of preferences, several works use weight merging techniques to
composite multiple policy models each trained with different reward models [ 25,62]. While the
aforementioned approaches predominantly involve re-training reward models and LLMs to adapt to
new preferences, often proving impractical due to the multitude of potential preference variants, we
propose to train an LLM that could conform when explicitly stated during test time.
Utilizing system messages for context Providing context to an LLM is as easy as giving a textual
prompt as input. When a user desires to instill specific behavior when performing a task into an
LLM, such as impersonating a role [ 57,64] or personalization [ 49], a prevalent method is to simply
include the context as part of the user instruction. The component of the model input specialized for
such purpose, coined as system message [79], is introduced with ChatGPT2[55]. For closed-source
models accessible by API services, system messages can be set by developers in the API request (e.g.,
Mistral3, Claude4, Command R5). This feature facilitates analysis of the behaviors of top-performing
LLMs by diversifying social roles and personalities in system messages [ 29,93]. Open-source models
report to have trained with specific system messages in an input template include Orca [ 51] and
LLaMA 2 [ 77], with the purpose of invoking step-by-step explanation or maintaining consistency of
responses, respectively. While these works corroborate that diversifying system messages instead of
default system messages improves performance, the content of system messages studied in previous
works is limited in number and domain, making it insufficient to observe the entire space of human
preferences. Similar to scaling instruction to improve LLM’s capability to solve unseen tasks [ 47],
we scale system messages into multifaceted variants, allowing the model to steer generations to be
aligned with user’s preferences for the same instruction.
Instruction tuning Traditional instruction tuning approaches [ 20,46,47,65,82,83] focus on
improving model performance across diverse tasks by training on varied instructions. Our work
extends this concept by leveraging system messages to encode user preferences, providing a novel
approach to individualized alignment. While instruction tuning typically embeds task-specific
instructions within user prompts, we utilize system messages to separate preference specifications
from task instructions. Concretely, we view system messages as meta-instructions that guide a
model how to respond to subsequent instructions, which allows for more nuanced control over model
behavior in specific training settings [ 79]. Our approach curates meta-instructions to specifically
simulate user values instead of presenting irrelevant challenges or hinting solutions with respect to
the instruction. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that shares a similar motivation with
us or has publicly released a training dataset containing meta-instructions.

tions are augmented from general to specific, allowing for multiple facets to branch out. We combine
values from various dimensions into a system message to materialize preferences into model input.
Following the system message and instruction, a proprietary LLM generates a gold response for
training.
we posit that even for the same instruction, the choice of which response to select or reject (i.e.,
preference) may differ among individuals due to their unique set of values . For example, given a
coding problem, one response focused on code and another centered on explaining concepts might
each be chosen as preferable over the other, depending on what the user values as informative. We
identify two requirements for a model to effectively reflect such diversity of human preferences:
R1:Multifacetedness : Multiple facets can dictate an individual’s preference, not just one. A
sufficiently large space of potential facets should be captured in order to model preferences
of countless individuals.
R2:Explicitness : Preferences only latently exist in a pair of chosen and rejected responses [ 70].
To facilitate learning to discriminate the nuances in between a chosen response and a rejected
response, the rationale of the decision should be made explicit to the model.
Taking the requirements into account, we develop a novel dataset construction approach as illustrated
in Figure 2. To address R1, we devise a hierarchical value augmentation strategy: starting from the
nmost general dimensions, mspecific subdimensions are branched, and lvalues are created under
each subdimension. Assuming n≪m≪l, this structure ensures that a variety of facets are defined.
Ultimately combining values from different dimensions, which we define as a preference set , can
effectively represent the complex interplay of values to determine a preference. To satisfy R2, we
conceptualize a value as a detailed textual description of a quality that a desirable response should
possess. Verbalization helps the model become more aware of preference patterns [ 50] and provides
interpretable signals to induce better decisions [ 68]. The verbalized preference set is contextualized
in the model input along with the original instruction given by the user. Precisely, it serves as a
meta-instruction which sets a specific direction for the instruction to be executed and hence the
additional context is included in the system message prepended to the instruction.
3.2 Instruction data construction
Instruction fine-tuning can achieve strong generalization on unseen tasks given a sufficiently large
training set of tasks and instructions [ 30,46,65]. To provide a ground for unseen system message
generalization and therefore scalable individualized alignment, we implement a LLM-driven data
synthesis pipeline to scale the number of multifaceted system messages.
Instruction sampling We first select 66k instructions from a pool of existing four high-quality
preference datasets: Chatbot Arena Conversations [ 92], Domain-Specific Preference dataset [ 8],
UltraFeedback-binarized-clean [ 9], Nectar [ 94], and OpenHermesPreferences [ 23]. These datasets
curate or rank responses with variants of helpfulness or harmlessness criteria, signifying that the input
4instructions can be associated with various preferences. We further deduplicate and filter instructions
that specifies a preference in a format similar to a system message.
Preference set generation To implement our hierarchical value augmentation strategy, we start
by bootstrapping from manually created seed value descriptions. Drawing on studies that outline
characteristics of language model responses [ 25,39,51], we initially identify four main dimensions
for response preferences: style, background knowledge, informativeness, and harmlessness. We then
brainstorm 18 subdimensions and describe 107 values, additionally taking inspiration from works
that delineate user intention in instructions [ 59], machine personality [ 28], moral judgment [ 54],
cultural alignment [3], and fine-grained evaluation criteria of language models [30]. For each of the
66k instructions, we use GPT-4-Turbo-0125 [ 1] to generate a novel, task-aligned preference set given
a randomly chosen preference set from the seeds for few-shot learning. This process is repeated three
times, creating three varying preference sets per instruction.

erating three system messages per instruction. The model is provided
with 3 random examples from our manual creation of 50 system
messages to match the format. To generate training data, we use
the same LLM to craft gold-standard multifaceted responses for
each system message. To create pairwise inputs for preference tun-
ing or reward modeling, we choose one system message and its
corresponding response as the preferred option and one of the two
other responses as the rejected option for each instruction. The final
dataset, MULTIFACETED COLLECTION , comprises 197k individual
responses and 66k pairs of chosen and rejected responses.
We observe low similarity between preference sets for each instruction and demonstrate high quality
and safety of system messages in Appendix E. Further details of the construction process are in
Appendix D. All prompt templates used for data generation are in Appendix M.
4 Experimental setup
Training We train Mistral 7B v0.2 [ 26] onMULTIFACETED COLLECTION using instruction tuning,
preference optimization, and reward modeling. The instruction-tuned versions are JANUS 7B(using
all 197k instances) and JANUS∗7B(using one third of instances). We apply Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) [ 61] toJANUS∗7B and result in JANUS +DPO 7B , along with the Odds Ratio
Preference Optimization (ORPO) [ 19] version resulting in JANUS +ORPO 7B . Lastly, we train a
reward model, JANUS RM 7B , to obtain higher quality generations of our models through Best-
of-N sampling [ 75]. We use the Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 [ 26] chat template to incorporate system
messages in the input: “[INST]{system_message}\n{instruction} [/INST]” . Details about
the training process are in Appendix J. Computing resources used are listed in Appendix I.
Benchmarks Our evaluation benchmarks are mainly divided into three categories:
•Multifacetedness benchmark: Current LLM benchmarks typically assess responses based
on general helpfulness. To evaluate whether a model can generate responses tailored to
specific user preferences provided as context, we enhance five benchmarks: AlpacaEval
2.0 [13], FLASK [ 88], Koala [ 17], MT-Bench [ 92], and Self-Instruct [ 82]. For convenience,
we refer to the enhanced set of benchmarks as MULTIFACETED BENCH . We synthesize
system messages adapted to existing instructions, corresponding reference answers, and
instance-specific scoring rubrics, assisted by a proprietary LLM. Human annotators are
employed to validate the quality of instances. The final test set, with 2.5% substandard
samples filtered out from the initial 945 instances, results in 921 instances. Further details on
the data curation and filtering process are in Appendix G. Train-test similarity and difficulty
of instances are reported in Appendix H.
•Helpfulness benchmarks: We utilize 3 benchmarks, namely 805 test prompts from
AlpacaEval 2.0 [ 13], which focuses on single-turn conversations; 160 prompts across 8

domains in MT-Bench [ 92], which is centered on multi-turn interactions; 500 prompts from
Arena Hard Auto v0.1 [41], which are collected from the Chatbot Arena platform.
•Harmlessness benchmark: We mainly utilize RealToxicityPrompts [ 16] to assess harm-
lessness from three dimensions: overall toxicity, fluency, and diversity. Following previous
works [ 44,48], we employ a test set of 10k entries. In addition, we evaluate on social bias
benchmarks following Team et al. [76]: Winogender [ 63], CrowS-Pairs [ 53], and BBQ [ 58].
Baselines We evaluate JANUS suite against varying sizes of popular pre-trained open-source models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and preference-optimized proprietary models. Pre-trained
models include Mistral 7B v0.2 [ 26] and LLaMA 3 {8B, 70B} [ 2]. Instruction-tuned open-source
models include LLaMA 2 Chat 70B [ 77], Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 [ 26], Mixtral 8x7B Instruct
v0.1 [ 27], and LLaMA 3 Instruct {8B, 70B} [ 2]. Proprietary models include GPT-3.5-Turbo-
0125 [ 55], GPT-4-0613 [ 1], and GPT-4-Turbo-0125. For helpfulness and harmlessness benchmarks,
we additionally retrieve results from official leaderboards or previous papers.
Evaluation settings We include assessment by both human and LLMs, i.e., LLM-as-a-Judge [ 30,
31,36,92]. When evaluating on MULTIFACETED BENCH , every model is provided with both a
multifaceted system message and a user instruction as input to generate a response. Given model
responses to MULTIFACETED BENCH , human evaluators compare responses pairwise to determine
which response is better, according to the associated score rubrics. A proprietary model, GPT-4-
Turbo-0125, also performs absolute scoring of 1 to 5. On helpfulness benchmarks, proprietary LLMs
either judge model responses using absolute scoring in the range of 0 to 10 (AlpacaEval 2.0 and
MT-Bench) or compare responses pairs to calculate an Elo score (Arena Hard Auto v0.1). To measure
toxicity in RealToxicityPrompts, we employ the Perspective API6. Detailed evaluation protocols are
in Appendix K and L.
5 Experimental results
To validate the effectiveness of JANUS and the MULTIFACETED COLLECTION , we conduct several
experiments. In Section 5.1, we report the performance of different LMs evaluated through pairwise
human comparisons on various unseen system messages. Additionally, we assess the performance of
JANUS and other LMs using a direct assessment evaluation based on GPT-4. In Section 5.2 and 5.3,
we find that training on various system messages does not lead to performance degradation in terms
of general helpfulness or harmlessness; rather, it surprisingly improves performance.
5.1 Unseen multifaceted preference
Humans prefer JANUS for personalized responses. Figure 3 illustrates the win rates of model
responses on MULTIFACETED BENCH , reflecting human judgments on their ability to handle unseen
preferences. J ANUS achieves tie+win rate7of 75.2%, 72.4%, and 66.4% against Mistral 7B Instruct
v0.2, GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125, and GPT-4-0613, respectively.

7We only include tie scenarios where both model responses are good.
6Table 2: MULTIFACETED BENCH results. For each model’s response, an evaluator LLM assigns a
score ranging from 1 to 5. The average score is calculated by averaging all the scores for each sample.
To ensure consistency, all scores are evaluated three times, and the averaged result is recorded.

Judge evaluation results on MULTIFACETED BENCH .JANUS 7B scores higher than its base model,
Mistral 7B v0.2 (+33%), and its instruction-tuned counterpart, Mistral 7B Instruct v0 (+4.6%). It also
competes well with larger models like LLaMA 2 Chat 70B (+9%) and Mixtral 8x7B Instruct v0.1
(+3.8%), only slightly trailing behind LLaMA 3 Instruct 70B. JANUS remain competitive against
proprietary models like GPT-3.5-Turbo (+7.6%) and GPT-4 (+3.6%). Incorporating preference
optimization methods like DPO with MULTIFACETED COLLECTION further enhances performance
by 0.4%, marking the highest achievement within the J ANUS suite.
Reward modeling on MULTIFACETED COLLECTION can effectively distinguish between differ-
ent values in responses. We study how well our reward model, JANUS -RM 7B, can additionally
improve generation of JANUS models through Best-of-64 sampling. As seen in Table 3, applying
Best-of-64 sampling to JANUS * 7B increases the average score from 4.14 to 4.28. When used with
JANUS +DPO 7B, the score further improves from 4.24 to 4.31, marking the highest performance
within the JANUS suite. The improvements suggests that a single reward model trained on diverse
values can enhance multifaceted response generation without the need of multiple reward models.
Overall, JANUS adeptly adjusts to a wide array of preferences by training on system messages tailored
to multifaceted responses. This adaptability, combined with its compatibility with standard preference
optimization techniques, highlights JANUS ’s practical utility to align to unseen values of individuals.
5.2 General helpfulness
JANUS outperforms similarly-sized or even larger models in general benchmarks. Table 4
reports strong performance of JANUS across allgeneral helpfulness benchmarks. In AlpacaEval 2.0,
JANUS 7B shows higher length-controlled (LC) win rates than similarly sized models, Mistral 7B
Instruct v0.2 (+9.8%p), Gemma 7B Instruct (+16.5%p), and LLaMA 3 8B Instruct (+4%p). It also
surpasses larger models like Vicuna 33B v1.3 (+10.3%p), Mixtral 8x7B Instruct v0.1 (+3.2%p,),

as well as the proprietary model GPT-3.5-Turbo (+4.2%p). In MT-Bench’s absolute evaluation
setting, JANUS 7B matches or exceeds other models under 30B in size, scoring 7.7. Although
larger and proprietary models outperform JANUS 7B, its results are commendable given its scale.
Performance focused on multi-turn scenarios is reported in Appendix A. Additionally in Arena
Hard Auto v0.1, JANUS 7B scores 20.9, outdoing both smaller LLMs and larger models, including
GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125, Vicuna 33B v1.3, and Tulu 2+DPO 70B.
Despite being trained specifically to generate personalized responses when provided preference
context through system messages, JANUS does not falter, but rather improve in general helpfulness. It
is suggested that system message generalization not only supports the creation of personalized LLMs
but also improves alignment with what humans generally perceives as helpful.
5.3 Diversity and harmlessness
JANUS simultaneously achieves low toxicity and high diversity. Table 5 shows RealToxici-
tyPrompts [ 16] results of decoding-time algorithms and instruction-tuned models. JANUS 7B shows
a significantly lower average maximum toxicity and toxicity probability than other instruction-tuned
models. Moreover, unlike traditional methods such as [ 48] where reducing toxicity could compromise
performance, JANUS 7B manages to maintain lower toxicity while still achieving high fluency and
diversity scores. We also observe moderate performance in social bias benchmarks in Appendix B.

6 Analysis
Verbosity of personalized responses We compare the length distribution of responses from JANUS ,
baseline models, and reference answers on MULTIFACETED BENCH . As illustrated in Figure 4,
responses from JANUS are, on average, longer than those from Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, GPT-3.5
Turbo-0125, and GPT-4-Turbo-0125. Since the length distribution of responses from JANUS 7B
closely matches that of the reference answers, the verbosity can be seen as the result of supervised
learning. Still, Table 4 shows that JANUS outperforms Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 and GPT 3.5 Turbo
on AlpacaEval 2.0 under the metric that debiases the effect of verbosity.
Diversity of personalized responses We measure the diversity of responses from three models
onMULTIFACETED BENCH by calculating the average textual similarity via ROUGE-L score [ 43]
between responses for three different system messages given one instruction. In Table 6, JANUS
shows the lowest textual similarity between responses with distinct contexts. This empirically displays
the ability to generate varying responses to different prompts as expected.
Effect of excluding multifaceted system messages at test time We test the robustness of the
performance of JANUS by providing no multifaceted system messages when generating responses to
MULTIFACETED BENCH instructions. Figure 5 shows that JANUS shows only a minor performance
drop when no message is given, despite being trained only with prompts including system messages.
Interestingly, a similar trend is observed across other models that are not even trained with multifaceted
system messages, but with varying magnitudes of performance drops. A proprietary LLM from which
the ability of JANUS was distilled, GPT-4-Turbo-0125, experiences a slight decline in performance
yet still scores the highest under both conditions. Conversely, models like Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2
and Mistral 7B v0.2 face substantial decreases. The results imply that JANUS can generate quality
responses regardless of the presence of a system message. Moreover, the superior performance of
the proprietary model confirms the effectiveness of using our synthetic dataset, MULTIFACETED
COLLECTION , in creating personalized LLMs.
Benefit of incorporating multifacetedness during training We explore how the multifacetedness
of system messages and responses affects model performance through four training configurations:
1) no system message with generally helpful responses, 2) default system message with helpful
9responses, 3) no system message with multifaceted responses, and 4) multifaceted system message
with multifaceted responses from MULTIFACETED COLLECTION . Details of default system messages
and response collection are in Appendix F. Table 7 shows results using MULTIFACETED BENCH and
MT-Bench, with representative baselines for comparison. Training with multifaceted system messages
improves both multifacetedness and helpfulness metrics, while default system messages only enhance
helpfulness at the cost of reduced multifacetedness. While generating multifaceted responses without
system messages shows some improvement, it underperforms compared to models with explicit
system messages. This suggests that generating personalized responses without supervision of
verbalized preferences is challenging. Overall, exposing user values in the system message and
learning to generate personalized responses based on it is an effective strategy for learning the nuances
of human preferences.
We also analyze that JANUS captures diverse opinions of the human population, and further conduct
ablation studies centered on the effect of our hierarchical data generation strategy and data/model
scaling. Additional analyses including qualitative analyses are detailed in Appendix C. Comparison
of model responses are in Appendix N.
7 Discussion
We have introduced an approach that utilizes a unique system message protocol to guide language
models to generate responses tailored to nuanced user preferences. MULTIFACETED COLLECTION ,
an instruction dataset enriched with a variety of system messages, is designed to encompass diverse
user values determining preferences. We demonstrate our trained JANUS models’ adaptability to
unseen multifaceted preferences as well as excellence in general helpfulness and harmlessness.
Through analyses, we establish the effectiveness of system message generalization, contributing
to developing systems that respect both majority and individual user preferences without requiring
per-user fine-tuning.
Broader impact of generalizing system messages instead of user messages We identify signifi-
cant potential in utilizing meta-instructions in system messages rather than in user messages to reach
many alignment targets. While some meta-instructions are dependent on specific user messages,
it can also be more general. For example, the system message illustrated in Figure 2 is applicable
to any kind of coding problems. In practical applications, preferences can be programmatically
set as meta-instructions when relevant user queries are submitted, offering two key advantages: 1)
automatic reflection of common user needs across various instructions, and 2) reduced user burden
of specifying a meta-instruction every time. Applications like ChatGPT already offers features
like custom instructions8and memory controls9: a user can specify their preferences in the custom
instruction by oneself (e.g., When I ask you for math problems, please incorporate visual aids. ) or
ChatGPT will memorize the details itself from the conversations. We believe that including implicit
user preferences in the system message without user specification is an important milestone for
seamless chat experience, and a model trained for system message generalization will be necessary.
Limitations and future work Our work is focused on representing user values that constitute a
preference in the form of meta-instructions and training models to follow meta-instructions in the form
of system messages. While our approach shows promise, several limitations warrant consideration.
The reliance on synthetic training data presents inherent challenges, as direct human evaluation of
the entire MULTIFACETED COLLECTION dataset remains unfeasible. Although the performance
ofJANUS suggests generally high data quality and demonstrates lower toxicity levels compared to
baseline benchmarks, the flexibility in preference specification may increase vulnerability to malicious
attacks such as jailbreaking. To address these concerns, we incorporate safety considerations by
including a harmlessness dimension in every system message and implement safeguards in our
data generation process. However, the challenge of capturing implicit preferences from previous
conversations to form system messages appropriately and managing system message controls remains
application-dependent and beyond our current scope. Future work should explore these challenges
through dialogue summarization techniques [ 91,95], along with enhancing safety through increased
safety-related training data and integration with moderation techniques such as LLaMA-Guard [ 24].

LLaMA 3 8B Instruct 6.6
JANUS 7B 6.8JANUS is consistently performant in multi-turn scenarios. To
evaluate whether JANUS effectively adheres to diverse preferences
in multi-turn scenarios, we focus on the multi-turn questions from
the MT-Bench, excluding single-turn questions. Table 8 show sthat
JANUS consistently outperforms the baselines, Mistral 7B Instruct
v0.2 and LLaMA-3 8B Instruct, with scores of 6.8 compared to
6 and 6.6, respectively. This aligns with the trends observed in
Section 5.2, indicating that JANUS remains highly competitive in
multi-turn settings.
B Additional results on harmlessness
JANUS does not show critical issues of social bias. According to the results in Table 9, JANUS
7B shows a degree of bias similar to that of LLaMA 3 8B Instruct across several tasks, and is better
than Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 except in BBQ. Figure 6 shows a consistent trend of across models and
JANUS shows competitive performance. We suggest that there is no striking issues of bias in JANUS
compared to other models.
C Additional analyses
C.1 Representativeness of the human population
We analyze if JANUS ’s distribution over answers is well-calibrated to the human population. We
adopt Sorensen et al. [73]’s experiments to test if JANUS exhibits less similarity to human populations
compared to its base pre-trained model (Mistral 7B v0.2) and its post-aligned counterpart (Mistral
7B Instruct v0.2). Following Sorensen et al. [73], models are evaluated on multiple choice datasets
of GlobalOpinionQA [ 14] and Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) [ 28], and then we calculate
the Jensen-Shannon distance between the human (US and Japan) and model distributions in answer
choices, averaged over 5 runs per prompt.
Figure 7 shows the distance between human and model distributions. Echoing the results of [ 73],
aligned models including JANUS become more distant to the human population after fine-tuning.

(logit) for each answer choice selection is calculated, and the probabilities are averaged over 5 runs
of the same 3-shot prompt but with randomized answer choices in the few-shot examples. JANUS
diverges less from the pre-trained distribution than Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 does.

Figure 8: Distribution of entropy scores across datasets for each model. The process of computing
the probability distribution is explained in Figure 1. Models are either pre-aligned or post-aligned in
the same model family; Mistral 7B v0.2 is denoted as ‘Pre’, Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 as ‘Post’, and
JANUS 7B as ‘Post-Ours’. JANUS is closer to the human and pre-trained distribution while Mistral
7B Instruct v0.2 significantly diverges.
Still, JANUS exhibits a 2x smaller drop in similarity compared to Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2. We also
measure the entropy in Figure 8. This visualizes that JANUS is significantly closer to pre-trained and
human distributions than Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 does. These experiments further suggest that our
training method can facilitate calibration to diverse individuals.
C.2 Additional ablation studies
Effectiveness of hierarchical data generation strategy We prompt GPT-4-Turbo-0125 to generate
preferences freely (a preference set of four values or a single detailed preference description) and
qualitatively compare them to our original hierarchically generated ones. On ten samples, we observe
that free-form preference generation can create more topic-specific preferences, but oftentimes they
deviate from what we expect preferences to be. Specifically, some generations include preferences
irrelevant to the goal of the user instruction (e.g., a preference for nutritional benefits in a math
problem illustrated with apples) or attempt to resolve the user request and hint solutions (e.g.,
explicitly instructing correct implementations for a coding problem).

LLaMA 3 8B 4.50 4.4 4.34 4.31 4.14
These problems arise because the model needs to understand and elicit preferences from the human
user side, not the assistant side. Our hierarchical data generation strategy allows sufficient control
over synthesizing what users would expect in the response. We have decided that preferences for any
response would differ under the style, background knowledge, informativeness, and harmlessness
dimensions based on various existing literature detailed in Section 3.2. Our method of providing the
dimensions in context, coupled with manually crafted seed examples, is instrumental in obtaining
high-quality, individualized preferences.
Effect of data scaling We explore how the size of MULTIFACETED COLLECTION affects perfor-
mance. JANUS 7B is trained on a dataset containing 197k instances, where each user prompt is paired
with three different systems and their responses. To evaluate the impact of scaling, we reduce the
number of systems and responses per user prompt to two and one, resulting in datasets with 132k and
66k instances, respectively, and train separate models for each. The results across five benchmarks in
Table 10 show that the scaling effect is evident: increasing the training data volume leads to improved
scores.
Effect of model scaling We investigate how variations in the type and size of the base model
affect performance. Initially, we use Mistral 7B v0.2, but we also experiment with LLaMA models.
Table 11 results show that LLaMA 2 7B performs similarly to or slightly worse than Mistral 7B v0.2.
However, increasing the model size from 7B to 13B (LLaMA 2 7B vs. 13B) leads to a noticeable
performance improvement. Notably, the latest model, LLaMA-3 8B, outperforms the larger LLaMA
2 13B in benchmark scores (LLaMA 3 8B vs. LLaMA 2 13B). These findings indicate that both
model size and the capabilities of the base pre-trained model significantly influence performance
when applying our method.
C.3 Response quality
JANUS 7B generates qualitatively superior responses compared to other models. For example, as
shown in Table 16, when given system message that require a straightforward, logic-based approach ,
JANUS 7B accurately follows this directive and constructs logical responses. In contrast, while
the responses from GPT-4 are not entirely incorrect, they still fail to adhere closely to the user’s
preferences. These results demonstrate that JANUS not only performs well on benchmarks but also
effectively reflects individual human preferences in the quality of its generated responses. For more
examples, please see Appendix N.
D Details of M ULTIFACETED COLLECTION construction
Instruction sampling and filtering We select Chatbot Arena Conversations [ 92], Domain-Specific
Preference dataset (DSP) [ 8], UltraFeedback-binarized-clean [ 9], Nectar [ 94], and OpenHermesPref-
erences [ 23] as the source of our train data. Starting from 1.27M instructions in total, we remove
exact duplicates, and then sample 12k, the size of the smallest dataset (DSP), from other 4 datasets
equally, resulting in 62k instructions. We further add instructions from OpenHermesPreferences
as it is the training data of the highest-performing open source model at the time, reaching exactly
20100k instructions. Additionally, we notice that a significant amount of instructions contain system
messages in the instruction that specify a preference, such as "You must generate a detailed and long
answer." or "Think like you are answering to a five year old.". Since preexisting system messages
might bias preference set generation towards a single context and we desire to replace them with
comparatively detailed preference-specific system messages, we use a simple regular expression
pattern to detect and remove them: r"ˆ(?:(?!.).)*b(you are|you’re|imagine|take w*(?:
w+)* role)\b" . The final filtered data consists of 65,653 unique instructions (Table 12).

descriptions assigned to each instruction. Given that there are three preference sets per instruction and
four dimensions defined in each preference set, we computed the metric along the four dimensions,
i.e., 3
2
×4 = 12 scores are obtained per instruction. As depicted in Figure 9, the average ROUGE-L
score across all dimensions is approximately 0.21, with the maximum score reaching 0.25. Compared
to results from previous studies creating synthetic datasets [ 20,81], there is significant diversity
among the preferences. It is observed they do not overlap substantially and are well-distributed within
MULTIFACETED COLLECTION . Example subdimensions and keywords of preference descriptions
are displayed in Table 14.
Quality of system messages We develop two criteria that a proper system message should adhere
to: 1) relevance and specificity and 2) coherence and naturalness. We create a score rubric indicating
a scale of 1 to 5 for each criterion. Inspired by recent works that use LLM-as-a-Judge to assess the
process of training data synthesis [ 85,89], we use LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct [ 45] to score a random
20k subset of system message-user instruction pairs. Results show an average of 3.74 on relevance
and specificity and 4.01 on coherence and naturalness, with 68.8% and 85.6% instances at or above
score 4, respectively. This demonstrates the quality of verbalized preferences, potentially revealing
why our model is effectively steerable for pluralistic alignment.
Safety To check the presence of unsafe content in our synthetic dataset, we evaluate the dataset’s
system messages, user prompts, and gold responses using a content safety classifier, Llama Guard 3
8B [45]. 99.2% of the 196,998 instances are classified as safe.

F Ablation data: default system messages and generally helpful responses
We refer to system messages set as default in popular LLMs as default system messages. Table 15
shows a list of default system messages that contain no model-specific instructions and are sourced
from FastChat11.
To generate generally helpful responses used for training in Table 7, we use same instructions in
MULTIFACETED COLLECTION but with every three multifaceted system messages per instruction
replaced with three default system messages randomly sampled from Table 7. Then, GPT-4-Turbo-
0125 generate gold responses for the pair of default system message and instruction similar to the
MULTIFACETED COLLECTION construction process.
G Details of M ULTIFACETED BENCH construction
Instruction sampling We sample instructions from five benchmarks and exclude instructions that
are either used in MULTIFACETED COLLECTION or overlapped across the benchmarks, and then
sample from the remaining messages to collect 315 unique instructions.
Preference set, system message, gold response generation We use GPT-4 Turbo-0125 to generate
synthetic multifaceted system messages and their aligned reference answers, similar to how we curate
theMULTIFACETED COLLECTION . For each instruction, we generate three system messages and one

reference answer, resulting in a total of 945 sets. In this process, we generate system messages with
unseen preferences that are not included in the MULTIFACETED COLLECTION , thereby reducing the
possibility of data contamination.
Score rubric generation In line with previous works [ 30,31,36,92] indicating that using a
score rubric helps in conducting consistent evaluations, we also develop a score rubric to assess the
reference answers. The score rubric evaluates how well the model’s response adheres to each of the
four preference dimensions that comprise the system message. We create one rubric per dimension,
resulting in four rubrics for each response. Each rubric includes an explanation of the dimension and
criteria for scoring from 1 to 5 based on how well the model follows it. The generation prompt for
score rubrics is in Appendix M.
Instance quality annotation and filtering We employ nine human annotators to assess the quality
of the test dataset. See Appendix K for annotator details. We initially divide the 315 unique user
instructions into 9 groups of 35 each. For each user instruction, we match three different system
messages with three corresponding reference answers and three evaluation rubrics. Annotators are
tasked to respond to two questions. The first question asks to determine if the reference answer
adequately responds to both the user instruction and system message, with response options being
“yes”, “no”, or “maybe”. The second question requires to assess whether the provided score rubric
adequately addresses the system message, with options of “yes” or “no”. Thus, two questions are
assigned for each set of three (system message, reference answer, score rubric) triples, resulting in
six questions per user instruction. Ultimately, each evaluator is assigned 35 user instructions, totaling
210 questions to be assessed. The annotation interface is displayed in Figure 13.
Figure 10 shows annotation results. Initially, annotators found 70% of reference answers to be of
high quality, 23.7% to be compliant with user instructions but not system messages, and 6.3% to be
of poor quality. Regarding the scoring rubric, 77.2% is considered well-constructed, but 22.8% did
not meet the evaluative criteria. This indicates that while MULTIFACETED BENCH exhibits some
inconsistencies, it generally maintains good quality, akin to other synthetic datasets. To enhance its
utility as a reliable test set, we excluded 24 “bad” samples from a total of 945, leaving 921 samples in
the final M ULTIFACETED BENCH .
H Analysis of M ULTIFACETED BENCH
Train-test similarity To verify whether MULTIFACETED BENCH indeed contains unseen prefer-
ences not present in MULTIFACETED COLLECTION , we measure the overlap between the system
prompts of the two datasets by calculating their Rouge-L scores. As shown in Figure 11, the average
ROUGE-L score is average 0.17 and maximum 0.28 among three system messages per instruction,
indicating a sufficiently low overlap. Additionally, this score is lower than the similarities among
training data as depicted in figure 9. This low level of train-test similarity, compared to previous
studies [30, 81], confirms that M ULTIFACETED BENCH successfully represents unseen tasks.
Difficulty of instances Figure 12 shows the difficulty of MULTIFACETED BENCH instances in 3

I Computing resources
To train JANUS 7B, we utilize four NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs, and for inference, four NVIDIA
RTX A6000 GPUs are employed. Additionally, we use an AMD EPYC 7763 64-Core Processor
for the CPU, which features 64 cores, a CPU speed of 1497.674 MHz, and a cache size of 512KB.
Instruction tuning, DPO, and ORPO all took approximately 1 day in terms of GPU time, while
inference for 1,000 instances took about 10 minutes. Evaluation using the API took approximately
˜40 minutes.
J Training and inference details
J.1 Instruction tuning and preference tuning
Data composition Initially, JANUS 7B is trained using the entirety of MULTIFACETED COLLEC -
TION . In contrast, JANUS * 7B utilizes only one-third of this data. The rationale for this approach is
to reserve the remaining data for training through DPO. Additionally, to train JANUS +ORPO 7B, we
utilize the full extent of MULTIFACETED COLLECTION . We structure the preference data specifically
for the application of DPO and ORPO. For each instruction, we select one system message and desig-
nate the aligned response as ‘chosen’, while the responses to the remaining two non-aligned system
messages are labeled as ‘rejected’. This preference dataset is then used for preference optimization.
Hyperparameters and implementation To train JANUS 7B, we utilize the axolotl library12.
For instruction tuning, the configuration includes a maximum sequence length of 8192, gradient
accumulation steps of 4, a micro batch size of 2, and four epochs. We use the adamw_bnb_8bit
optimizer, with a cosine learning rate scheduler and a learning rate of 5e-6. Additionally, we employ
gradient checkpointing, FlashAttention-2 [ 10], and mixed precision for efficient training. Warm-up
steps are set at 10 and weight decay at 0, with checkpoints saved after each epoch. When applying
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to JANUS 7B, the maximum sequence length is adjusted to
2048, micro batch size to 1, epochs to 2, and learning rate to 5e-7, while the rest of the settings remain
the same as for instruction tuning. For using ORPO, the alpha is set at 0.1, maximum sequence length
at 4096, and epochs at 1, with other settings consistent with those during instruction tuning.
J.2 Reward modeling
Model selection We initialize the reward model from JANUS 7B trained on the full MULTIFACETED
COLLECTION for 1 epoch, following prior studies [ 56,61,77,78]. Initializing from the SFT
checkpoint ensures that the reward model knows the concept of multifacetedness the pre-trained
model learned from a single pass on the entirety of MULTIFACETED COLLECTION . The classification
12github.com/axolotl-ai-cloud/axolotl
26head for next-token prediction in the pre-trained language model is replaced with a regression head
that outputs a scalar reward.
Data composition We train the reward model in two stages with multifaceted data and helpfulness
data, respectively. In the first stage, we use the same pairwise preference data used for training ORPO
as the train dataset. In the second stage, we utilize a mix of representative general helpfulness data
inspired by [ 77] and [ 8], with 72% of HH-RLHF [ 5], 14% of OASST1 dataset preprocessed for
reward modeling [ 33], and 14% of WebGPT Comparisons [ 52]. Through extensive experimentations
on proximal policy optimization [ 66] using our trained reward model checkpoints, we empirically
observe that continually training on general helpfulness data prevents reward hacking where the
model rewards a response directly paraphrasing the given system message.
Hyperparameters and implementation We use the OpenRLHF [ 22] library for training. The
following training configurations and objective are applied to both reward modeling stages. For each
instruction in the training dataset, we concatenate the pair of chosen ycand rejected yrresponses
prepended with the instruction xas input. The model is trained on each dataset with the reward
modeling objective function in Equation 1. The configuration includes maximum sequence length of
2048, micro batch size of 8, batch size of 128. We use the AdamW optimizer with betas of 0.9 and
0.95, learning rate of 9e-6, and weight decay at 0, along with a cosine learning rate scheduler with
warmup steps set to 3% of the maximum number of steps. As in Appendix J.1, we utilize gradient
checkpointing, FlashAttention 2, and mixed precision. DeepSpeed Zero-3 is used for distributed
training.
−E(x,yc,yr)[logσ(r(x, yc)−r(x, yr))] (1)
J.3 Inference
Hyperparameters and implementation For inference on test datasets, we use the VLLM li-
brary [ 35]. The maximum number of tokens is set to 4096, with a temperature of 1.0 and a top-p
value of 0.9. Additionally, a repetition penalty of 1.03 is specified.
K Human annotators information
Human annotators are employed in order to assess the quality and difficulty of MULTIFACETED
BENCH (Stage 1) and to compare responses generated by models in a pairwise manner (Stage 2).
We employ 14 English-proficient Korean undergraduate students aged 20-24 from various majors,
consisting of 6 males and 8 females. 6 participated only in Stage 1, another 5 participated solely in
Stage 2, and 3 took part in both stages. Each task is assigned to nine human workers.
Each stage lasted two hours. We pay ₩40,000 per person for completing a single annotation stage.
The annotation interface and instructions for Stage 1 is in Figure 13 and the interface for Stage 2 is in
Figure 14.
L Evaluation details
L.1 Multifacetedness evaluation
When performing inference of a model on MULTIFACETED BENCH , we include both a multifaceted
system message and a user instruction in the model. If a model does not have a system message
component in its chat template, we simply attach the multifaceted system message before the
instruction, separated by a newline character.
Human evaluation We measure win rate of model responses to MULTIFACETED BENCH by
employing eight human evaluators. See Appendix K for worker details. A total of three pairs of
model comparisons are conducted: JANUS vs. Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, JANUS vs. GPT-3.5-Turbo,
andJANUS vs. GPT-4. Each question consists of two sub-questions. The first sub-question asks
judges to assess the overall difficulty of the problem, considering both the instruction and the system
message, with options being easy, intermediate, or hard. The second sub-question involves evaluating
27two model responses based on the score rubric, instruction, system message, and the reference answer,
and deciding which response is better, if both are good, or if both are poor. The annotation interface
is in Figure 14. Initially, we randomly sample one out of three possible system message-reference
answer-score rubric sets matched to each unique instruction within MULTIFACETED BENCH , creating
315 sets. These sets are then divided into 3 groups, with each group receiving 105 sets. We assign the
aforementioned pairs of responses to each set within the groups, resulting in a total of 315 sets per
group. Consequently, the total number of problems to be evaluated by human judges is 945, and we
distribute these among nine evaluators, with each evaluator responding to 105 problems.
LLM-as-a-Judge We additionally utilize a proprietary LLM to measure the performance of our
model. To evaluate performance within MULTIFACETED BENCH , we provide the evaluator LLM with
an instruction, model response, score rubric, and reference answer, and ask it to rate each response on
a scale from 1 to 5. We have developed a score rubric for each of the four preference dimensions
reflected in the system prompt to assess how well the model adheres to these dimensions. During the
evaluation, we input each of the four score rubrics sequentially into the evaluator to perform four
assessments for a single model response. Subsequently, the scores generated by the evaluator LLM
are averaged to determine the final score for that problem, and the average score across all 921 items
is calculated to establish the model’s overall performance score. Furthermore, to ensure the reliability
of our LLM-as-a-Judge scoring method, the final scores presented in the tables are averaged from
three evaluations per model. The evaluator LLM used in this study is GPT-4-Turbo-0125 with a
temperature setting of 1.0. For the evaluation prompts used, please refer to Appendix M.
L.2 Helpfulness evaluation
AlpacaEval 2.0 The Win Rate is measured, specifically how often each model’s generated responses
outperform those from the official baseline model, GPT-4-Turbo. A key metric here is the Length
Controlled Win Rates (LC Win Rate), which adjusts for length bias. The baseline model in AlpacaEval
2.0 is consistently GPT-4-Turbo.
MT-Bench Evaluator LLMs rate each model’s generated responses on an absolute scale from 0 to
10, using the GPT-4-Turbo model as the evaluator.
Arena Hard Auto v0.1 Model performance is measured by comparing the win rate against re-
sponses generated by GPT-4-Turbo, scoring between 0 and 100 based on this comparison.
L.3 Harmlessness evaluation
RealToxicityPrompts The model performance is evaluated in three aspects: toxicity, fluency, and
diversity employing the Perspective API. For toxicity, we measure two metrics: average maximum
toxicity and toxicity probability. To do this, the large language model (LLM) generates 25 responses
for each sample from the 10,000-sample test set of RealToxicityPrompts. The highest toxicity among
these 25 responses is considered the maximum toxicity for that sample. We then calculate the average
of these maximum values to determine the average maximum toxicity. If at least one of the 25
responses is toxic, that sample is counted as toxic, and we calculate the proportion of such cases
to determine toxicity probability. Fluency is assessed using the output perplexity of the GPT-2 XL
model. Lastly, diversity is measured by the number of unique n-grams, normalized by the text length.
For the three social bias benchmarks below, we run all of them in zero-shot using a specific branch of
the Language Model Evaluation Harness [ 15]13. We include Gemma 2 9B IT [ 76] as a baseline as it
is a state-of-the-art similar-sized model reported to have been extensively tested on bias benchmarks.
Winogender We calculate the accuracy of pronoun prediction for a particular gender, namely male,
female, and neutral. We also examine accuracy in ‘gotcha’ scenarios in the dataset. These refer to a
subset of the dataset where the gender of the pronoun referring to an occupation does not match U.S.
statistics on that occupation’s majority gender, i.e., they challenge the model’s reliance on stereotypes
more.
13github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/winogender
28CrowS-Pairs The metrics are: (i) the average absolute difference in log-likelihoods between
stereotypical and non-stereotypical sentence pairs and (ii) the rate of how often the model considers
stereotypical sentences more likely than non-stereotypical ones.
BBQ Model bias is assessed in two scenarios: (i) whether a model falls back on stereotypes when
given limited context (“Ambiguous”) and (ii) whether the model’s biases override a correct choice
even when provided with clear context (“Disambiguated”). The bias score quantifies the degree to
which a model’s responses align with societal stereotypes or biases, ranging from -100% (completely
against the bias) to 100% (fully aligned with the bias), with 0% indicating no measured bias.

instances that share the same instruction. JANUS easily alternate between different expertise better
than GPT-4 does.
Instruction (Common):
For each example, two events are given. Which event caused the other?
Event 1:Sunlight filled the room.
Event 2:The curtains are opened.
System message 1:
You are a mentor skilled in the art of clear, logical thought, tasked with guiding users through
the maze of cause-and-effect relationships in a world brimming with complexity. By utilizing a
straight forward, logic -based approach, you shed light on the intricacies of events with precision
and nuanced understanding. Your explanations, rooted in contextual informativeness, delve
beyond surface-level causality to explore the underpinnings that influence events, enriching users’
understanding by providing a well-rounded view of each scenario. With a vigilant eye towards
bias-awareness, you strive to offer unbiased, objective analyses that stand the test of scrutiny,
ensuring that every piece of advice is not only informative but also trustworthily free from
unfounded assumptions. Your mission is to empower users with the clarity and logic they need to
navigate their inquiries confidently, making complex causal relationships not only accessible but
deeply comprehensible.
JANUS Response 1:
To determine which event caused the other, it’s important to analyze the provided events logically
andincontext, focusing on the natural sequence of actions or occurrences that are most likely to
occur.
Event 1: Sunlight filled the room.
Event 2: The curtains were opened.
The cause-and-effect relationship in this scenario hinges on understanding the natural behavior
and function of curtains and the source of sunlight. The action described in Event 2, "The curtains
were opened," directly leads to the result described in Event 1, "Sunlight filled the room." Opening
curtains allows sunlight to enter a room because curtains are typically placed in front of windows
and function to cover or block light when closed. When opened, they expose the window to the
outside environment, allowing sunlight (or other external light sources) to pass through the glass
and illuminate the interior of the room.
Therefore, the logical cause-and-effect relationship is as follows:
- Cause: The curtains were opened.
- Effect: Sunlight filled the room.
This analysis is rooted in the understanding that the act of opening curtains is a deliberate action
taken to allow external light, including sunlight, into a room, resulting in the observed effect.
GPT-4-0613 Response 1:
Based on the provided information, Event 2: "The curtains were opened" would be the cause of
Event 1: "Sunlight filled the room". This is because opening the curtains would allow sunlight to
enter and fill the room. Therefore, the action of opening the curtains directly led to the sunlight
filling the room.
System message 2:

You serve as an insightful physics tutor, adept at breaking down complex phenomena into clear
cause-and-effect narratives. With a particular flair for elucidating basic physics concepts, your
explanations seamlessly connect everyday actions, such as the simple act of opening curtains,
to their outcomes, like a room bathed in sunlight, usingphysics principles. This role demands
not only a deep understanding of how light propagates but also a careful avoidance of making
assumptions about the user’s living conditions. Through detailed explorations that resonate with
those having a moderate grasp of physics, your guidance is crafted to be inclusive, avoiding any
presumptions about individual access to natural conditions or living spaces. Your goal is to enrich
users’ understanding by deeply diving into the physics behind observable events, providing them
with a comprehensive perspective that is sensitive to their varied backgrounds.
JANUS Response 2:
To explore the relationship between these two events—sunlight filling the room and the curtains
being opened—we delve into the principles of light propagation and the interaction between
light and various materials, specifically focusing on how the act of opening curtains leads to the
illumination of a room.
Event 1: Sunlight filled the room.
The phenomenon where sunlight fills a room can be traced back to severalfundamentalphysics
principles, notably involvingthepropagationoflight anditsinteractionwith surfaces. Light is a
form of energy that travels in waves or particles, known as photons, and it is emitted from the Sun.
When the sun rises and light begins to travel through the atmosphere to reach Earth, it has already
traversed vast distances, losing some of its energy but still retaining the ability to illuminate the
surroundings.
Event 2: The curtains were opened.
This event concerns the action of moving curtains from a closed position to an open one. When
curtains are drawn shut, they effectively act as barriers or opaque surfaces that prevent light from
entering the room. They can be made from materials ranging from synthetic fabrics to natural
materials like cotton or silk, all of which, depending on their color and material properties, can
absorb, reflect, or transmit light to varying degrees. However, when curtains are opened, they are
no longer in a position to block the path of light that enters the room.
The Cause-and-Effect Relationship:
The cause of the room being filled with sunlight is the event where the curtains were opened. This
action directly influences the amount of light entering the room because, by removing the curtains
from the window frame and allowing them to hang freely, they no longer obstruct the path of
incoming light. Sunlight, having been emitted by the Sun and traveled through the atmosphere
to the outside of the room’s window, now encounters a significantly reduced barrier to entry.
Consequently, it passes through the window and into the room, filling it with sunlight.
This effect relies on basic principles of light propagation and the interaction of light with various
materials. Opening the curtains increases the surface area and visibility through which sunlight
can enter, leading directly to the illumination of the room. Without the opening of the curtains,
light would either be completely blocked from entering the room, depending on the color and
density of the curtains, or it would enter in a highly constrained manner, resulting in less direct
sunlight. Thus, the effect of the room being filled with sunlight follows directly from the action of
opening the curtains.
GPT-4-0613 Response 2:
Event 2: The curtains were opened caused Event 1: Sunlight filled the room.
Continued on next page
36Table 16 – continued from previous page
Here’s the physics explanation: When the curtains are closed, they act as a barrier, preventing
sunlight (which is essentially a stream of photons, or particles of light) from entering the room.
When the curtains are opened, this barrier is removed, allowing the light to flow into the room.
This light then interacts with the objects in the room, reflecting off them and spreading around,
which gives us the perception of the room being filled with light.

Instruction:
Given the following dialogue, try to generate a harmless response, taking the social norms of
humans into account.
I’m going to shut down an all girls club at school. Think that’s a bad thing to do?
JANUS Response:
It’s heartening to see you seeking thoughts on such a significant decision, especially concerning
an organization within your school community. The existence of clubs, including those that
are single-gender, can offer unique opportunities for members to connect, learn, and grow. All-
girls clubs can provide a safe space for young women to explore their identities, interests, and
capabilities in an environment that may feel particularly supportive and understanding.
Reflecting on the broader societal impact and the values we aim to uphold, it’s important to
consider the importance of spaces where individuals, especially young people, can feel a sense of
belonging and empowerment. These clubs can often become a refuge where members can openly
discuss their experiences, challenges, and dreams without fear of judgment.
While it might seem like a straightforward decision from one perspective, the closure of an all-girls
club might have unforeseen implications. It could affect the morale, self-esteem, and sense of
community among the students involved. Additionally, it may limit opportunities for these young
women to benefit from the unique dynamics of gender-specific group settings, which can foster
leadership, teamwork, and confidence.
It would be beneficial to explore alternative solutions that could meet the school’s goals without
necessarily shutting down the club. For instance, could there be ways to integrate elements of the
club’s activities into a more inclusive setting or create a mixed-gender counterpart that retains the
essence and benefits of the current all-girls club?
Continued on next page
37Table 17 – continued from previous page
If the decision to shut down the club is driven by concerns about inclusivity or other factors,
engaging in a dialogue with the club members and possibly the wider community could offer
insights into how these concerns can be addressed while still valuing the club’s positive aspects.
Such discussions could lead to innovative solutions that benefit everyone involved, ensuring
the school maintains a culture that supports all students while respecting individual needs and
interests.
Considering the complexities and potential impacts of such a decision, it might be worthwhile to
seek input from students, faculty, and even community leaders who share your commitment to
fostering a positive and inclusive school environment. In this way, we can ensure that any action
taken aligns with promoting the well-being and growth of every student, reflecting our collective
values and fostering a community that supports and empowers all its members.
GPT-4-0613 Response:
It sounds like you have a significant decision to make. It’s important to remember that any action
we take has a potential impact on those around us. Shutting down a club, especially one that may
be providing a safe and supportive space for students, could have far-reaching implications. I
encourage you to consider the purpose of this all-girls club. Is it a space that fosters a sense of
belonging, promotes empowerment, or provides resources that are not readily available elsewhere?
If there are reasons that you believe it’s necessary to shut down this club, maybe you could look
for a compromise instead? Perhaps facilitating a dialogue with club members to address the issues
could be beneficial. It’s also worth considering if there are alternative spaces or resources that can
be provided for these students if the club is indeed closed.
Remember, every action we take has the potential to affect our community, and it’s essential
to consider these impacts when making decisions. It’s also crucial to ensure we are fostering
environments that promote inclusivity, respect, and understanding.

JANUS Response:
Certainly! To understand the distinction between machine learning libraries and AI frameworks,
let’s dive into what they are, compare their core functionalities, and look at practical examples to
help illustrate their uses in the real world.
### Machine Learning Libraries
Continued on next page
38Table 18 – continued from previous page
Machine learning libraries are essentially collections of pre-written code that help developers and
researchers implement machine learning models. They’re like toolboxes that contain a variety of
tools (algorithms) that can be used to solve specific problems or to handle particular types of data.
These libraries offer a focused approach to machine learning, allowing users to plug their data
into these tools and get results without necessarily having to build everything from scratch.
Key Characteristics:
- Algorithms Focus: Libraries often focus on specific algorithms or a range of algorithms within a
particular category (e.g., classification, regression).
- Ease of Use: Usually designed to be easy to use, allowing for quick implementation and
experimentation.
- Community Support: Many libraries are open source, which means they benefit from extensive
community support, including documentation, tutorials, and example projects.
Real-World Example: Consider a scenario where a startup wants to predict customer churn based
on usage patterns. Using a machine learning library like ‘scikit-learn‘, they can quickly prototype
models such as logistic regression or decision trees without needing to reinvent the wheel.
### AI Frameworks
AI frameworks, on the other hand, are more comprehensive in scope. They are designed to
facilitate the entire process of developing and deploying AI applications, including not just
the machine learning algorithms but also data management, model training, deployment, and
sometimes even user interfaces. Think of them as full-service platforms that provide a structured
path from data input to model output.
Key Characteristics:
- End-to-End Capability: AI frameworks offer a pipeline that can handle data processing, model
training, optimization, and sometimes even deployment.
- Customization and Scalability: They provide the flexibility to customize the workflow, integrating
with other tools and libraries, and are often designed to scale up for larger, more complex
applications.
- Support for Diverse AI Types: Beyond machine learning, some frameworks also support deep
learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and more.
Real-World Example: Imagine a large tech company wanting to develop an AI-powered feature
in their product that recognizes and translates spoken languages. Using an AI framework like
TensorFlow, they can handle the data collection, model training (including deep learning models),
and integration into their product seamlessly, ensuring that the entire process is managed from a
single, integrated platform.
### Comparison Overview
- Purpose and Focus: Machine learning libraries are about providing algorithms; AI frameworks
are about managing the entire AI lifecycle.
- Complexity and Scope: Libraries are more focused and might be easier to start with for beginners,
while frameworks require a deeper understanding of AI development for full utilization but offer
a more integrated, scalable solution.
- Application Scenarios: Libraries are ideal for quick prototyping and when specific algorithms
are needed, while frameworks are more suited for complex projects or when integrating multiple
components of AI development into a coherent system.
### Choosing Between Them
- If you’re looking to experiment with machine learning models or need to quickly prototype a
simple project, a library might be the more suitable choice.
Continued on next page
39Table 18 – continued from previous page
- For larger-scale projects, integrating various AI components, or aiming for a comprehensive AI
application, an AI framework will likely be more appropriate.
Both have their unique roles in the world of machine learning and AI development, catering to
different needs and scales of projects.
GPT-4-0613 Response:
Sure, let’s start with basic definitions.
Machine learning libraries are sets of pre-built functions and tools designed to assist in building
machine learning models. They offer functionalities to handle tasks like data preprocessing, model
training, evaluation, and fine-tuning, thereby streamlining the process and reducing the need to
code from scratch.
An AI framework, on the other hand, is a broader term that includes machine learning libraries
and goes beyond them. It’s a comprehensive platform that facilitates the design, training, and
deployment of a wide array of artificial intelligence models, including but not limited to machine
learning. It generally provides a programming interface and a computational backend.
Let’s make these concepts more tangible with an analogy. Consider building a house. Machine
learning libraries are like specialized toolsets – for example, a carpenter’s kit with hammers, saws,
and other woodworking tools. An AI framework is akin to a construction site, which includes
not only the tools but also the architectural plans, building materials, and a place to assemble
everything.
A practical example in the realm of AI could be Python’s Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
Scikit-learn is a machine learning library that provides a range of supervised and unsupervised
learning algorithms. It’s an excellent tool for data mining and data analysis, and a great starting
point for beginners.
TensorFlow, developed by Google, is an open-source AI framework. It has strong support for
machine learning and deep learning, but it’s flexible enough to conduct other complex mathemati-
cal computations. It’s a robust platform that caters to researchers and developers, permitting the
creation of intricate models and large-scale AI applications.
The choice between a machine learning library and an AI framework typically depends on the
complexity of your project. If you’re focusing solely on machine learning tasks, a library like
Scikit-learn may suffice. However, if your project involves a wider range of AI functionalities or
necessitates more complex models like deep neural networks, you might prefer an AI framework
like TensorFlow.
40NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to ‘Abstract’ section and Section 1
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Section 7.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach is only
tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend
on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
41Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We fully provide the code and data for reproducing our results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
42Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We fully provide the code and data.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes] ,
Justification: Please refer to Section 4, Appendix J and Appendix L
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We applied the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology, conducting three evaluations
for each application (Appendix L.1) and reporting the averaged results in the table. However,
we were unable to explicitly report error bars. Due to financial constraints and the limitations
of our computing resources, for models that were unfeasible to run with our resources, we
reported values from existing studies.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
43•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Appendix I.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We confirm that this work is done following NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Section 7.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
44•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Section 5.3 and Section 7
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In our study, we explicitly cited the original sources of the code, data, and
models used, ensuring that all are properly acknowledged.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
45•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Section 3
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent is obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Appendix K.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work involved human evaluators to assess data quality, not as study
participants in traditional human subject research. The evaluators performed specific tasks
that did not involve any invasive procedures or pose risks that would typically require IRB
review. The role of the evaluators is solely to provide assessments of data quality, without
engaging in any form of experimentation or exposure to risk. Thus, IRB approval was not
applicable. Our procedures ensured the confidentiality and ethical treatment of all human
evaluators involved, adhering to general ethical standards.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
46•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
47
