Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) for code are typically trained to align with natural
language instructions to closely follow their intentions and requirements. However,
in many practical scenarios, it becomes increasingly challenging for these models to
navigate the intricate boundary between helpfulness and safety, especially against
highly complex yet potentially malicious instructions. In this work, we introduce
INDICT: a new framework that empowers LLMs with Internal Dialogues of Cri-
tiques for both safety and helpfulness guidance. The internal dialogue is a dual
cooperative system between a safety-driven critic and a helpfulness-driven critic.
Each critic provides analysis against the given task and corresponding generated
response, equipped with external knowledge queried through relevant code snippets
and tools like web search and code interpreter. We engage the dual critic system in
both code generation stage as well as code execution stage, providing preemptive
and post-hoc guidance respectively to LLMs. We evaluated INDICT on 8 diverse
tasks across 8 programming languages from 5 benchmarks, using LLMs from 7B
to 70B parameters. We observed that our approach can provide an advanced level
of critiques of both safety and helpfulness analysis, significantly improving the
quality of output codes ( +10% absolute improvements in all models).2
1 Introduction
Extending from the natural language domain, Large Language Models (LLMs) like [Koubaa, 2023,
Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021, Radford et al., 2019] have demonstrated great potential in code
generation tasks [Svyatkovskiy et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2021, Hendrycks et al., 2021]. However,
when instructed with tasks containing malicious intentions or ambiguous requirements, LLMs are
subject to generating code that could facilitate harmful attacks or code that contains obscure security
problems [Khoury et al., 2023, Bhatt et al., 2023, Siddiq et al., 2022]. For instance, in a study of
Github’s Copilot, Pearce et al. [2022] observed that about 40% of generated programs are vulnerable.
Despite previous efforts in addressing the safety of LLMs through finetuning [Bai et al., 2022, Korbak
et al., 2023, Dai et al., 2024], this strategy alone is often not sufficient and scalable enough against
prompts that are increasingly optimised for highly sophisticated attacks [Zhuo et al., 2023, Mazeika
et al., 2024, Bhatt et al., 2024]. Furthermore, in the domain of code generation, creating quality
safety-related data for finetuning often incurs great costs, involving programming experts with a deep
understanding of code and related cyber-security and vulnerability concerns.
Note that code itself is often not inherently malicious. For example, as noted by Bhatt et al. [2023], a
program for an encryption method could be very useful to create a secure personal file system. Yet
the encryption method can also be exploited for a ransomware attack. Therefore, it is important to
develop an efficient method for LLMs to achieve the intricate balance between helpfulness and safety

Figure 1: INDICT (Internal Dialogues of Critiques) enables two different critics to interact with each
other autonomously and collaboratively, improving code generation by both security and helpfulness.
In this example, INDICT iteratively resolves the security weakness CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization
in an OS Command) and improves the code functionality with relevant supporting modules.
in the code domain. We introduce INDICT, Internal Dialogues of Critiques, a novel framework for
LLMs to generate code that is not only helpful but also safe and secure (see Figure 1 for an example
code generation task and Figure 2 for the method overview).
First, instead of a single critic for a specific code quality [Le et al., 2022, Welleck et al., 2023, Chen
et al., 2023c], we consider both helpfulness-driven critic and safety-driven critic. Instead of activating
these critics independently, we propose to position them in an autonomous agent system like [Huang
et al., 2022, Dong et al., 2023, Li et al., 2024]. Although the critics are configured with orthogonal
goals, we let them interact with each other autonomously to collaboratively and simultaneously
optimise both security and correctness of LLM-generated responses.
Extending from retrieval-augmented generation [Guu et al., 2020, Ram et al., 2023, Asai et al., 2024],
we also equip the critics with external knowledge retrieved by relevant code snippets and natural
language queries. Just like how human developers typically select and examine one small piece of
code at a time, the critics use a code snippet together with a text query to call relevant tools like web
search and code interpreters. The resulting outputs from the external tools are used by the critics to
generate more knowledge-grounded critiques for the “actor” LLM generator.
Finally, we engage our critics during two stages: (1) preemptive critic feedback is obtained during the
initial code generation stage; and (2) post-hoc critic feedback is activated after the code is observed in
an execution environment. Albeit more commonly used in prior work like [Li et al., 2022, Chen et al.,
2023c, Le et al., 2024], post-hoc feedback alone is not proactive enough for security-sensitive tasks.
In these tasks, unexpected damage may likely occur and create systematic impacts on execution
environments in practice [Hendrycks et al., 2023, Mazeika et al., 2024]. Our strategy facilitates a
“preemptive” layer of protection, creating a more holistic critic framework for code generation LLMs.
We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of INDICT on 8 diverse tasks across 8 programming
languages from 5 benchmarks. On LLMs ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, we observed consistent
performance improvement by both safety and helpfulness of generation outputs. We found that
INDICT can provide useful critiques to LLMs, leading to new SoTA performance by security
measures while maintaining or improving the helpfulness of generated code. Our approach also
generalises well to open-ended tasks, demonstrating the broader potential of a cooperative autonomous
critic system for helpful yet responsible AI models.

Our research is broadly related to the research of large language models (LLMs) [Koubaa, 2023,

agent, and finetuning. Compared to these methods, INDICT is a more well-rounded generation
framework with the following contributions: (1) integrates code execution-based feedback and
enhances them with external knowledge, (2) targets both helpfulness and safety of output code,
and (3) facilitates an interactive and supervision-free multi-agent collaboration framework. Our
experiment results showcase the efficacy of INDICT. See Appendix D for cited references.

a massive amount of text data on very deep Transformer-based architectures, these models have
shown impressive performance in many natural language tasks. Going beyond the text domain, LLMs
have been extended to learn from the code data and applied to many coding tasks [Rozière et al.,
2023, Li et al., 2023, Lozhkov et al., 2024, Gunasekar et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2023, Nijkamp et al.,
2023, Luo et al., 2023]. One major application of LLMs in the code domain is code generation, a
long-standing challenge of many conventional AI models [Manna and Waldinger, 1971, Gulwani
et al., 2012, Kurach et al., 2015, Devlin et al., 2017, Parisotto et al., 2016]. In this task, an AI model
is required to generate proper code solutions for different programming problems, ranging from basic
daily code completion tasks to more advanced algorithmic problems [Chen et al., 2021, Austin et al.,
2021, Hendrycks et al., 2021, Shinn et al., 2023, Lai et al., 2023].
In the research for code generation, we have witnessed emerging studies focusing on the security and
safety aspects of AI-generated code. Hammond Pearce et al. [2021], Schuster et al. [2021], Pearce
et al. [2022] found that commercially successful systems like Github’s Copilot still led to obscure
yet major vulnerability and security issues in code. More recently, Perez et al. [2022], Zhuo et al.
[2023], Khoury et al. [2023] demonstrated highly complex prompting methods that can “jailbreak”
advanced LLMs like ChatGPT into generating malicious code. To benchmark LLMs against code
safety and security, [Siddiq and Santos, 2022, Tony et al., 2023] evaluated LLMs against common
coding scenarios based on CWE3. More recently, Bhatt et al. [2023, 2024] introduced CyberSecEval,
a large-scale benchmark containing different types of security-aware evaluations. They observed that
the code outputs by powerful LLMs like Llama and GPT models are often not perfectly secure.
More relevant to our work is the research to improve the safety or helpfulness of LLMs. A com-
mon strategy is finetuning LLMs with appropriate preference data with specific reward models to
differentiate among ranked data samples [Bai et al., 2022, Korbak et al., 2023, Wu et al., 2024,
Sun et al., 2024, Dai et al., 2024]. In the code domain, He and Vechev [2023], He et al. [2024]
proposed to finetune LLMs with prompt prefixes or masking strategies conditioned by the safety
of corresponding code samples. Chen et al. [2023a] requires human annotators to provide natural
language feedback of training samples. Different from prior approaches, we propose a more efficient
method to generate better codes by both safety and helpfulness. Our approach can complement the
research of autonomous LLM agents [Huang et al., 2022, Yao et al., 2023, Dong et al., 2023] and
AI-generated feedback [Bahdanau et al., 2017, Le et al., 2022, Welleck et al., 2023, Gou et al., 2024].

Figure 2: INDICT (Internal Dialogues of Critiques) is a framework to generate code by both safety
and helpfulness. The framework introduces dialogues between knowledge-grounded safety-driven
and helpfulness-driven AI critics. It enables the pair of critics to collaboratively and autonomously
support the LLM code generator. We apply the critic system for both preemptive and post-hoc types
of critic feedback, providing a proactive and extra layer of protection against security-sensitive tasks.
3 INDICT Framework
3.1 Problem Definition
Typically, in a code generation task, an LLM θreceives an input X, consisting of a natural language
instruction and optionally, a related code context. Treating code generation as a sequence-to-sequence
task, the LLM autoregressively generates a response ˆYas a sequence of tokens. Each token ˆytis
sampled from the parameterized condition distribution pθ(.|ˆy1:t−1, X)where ˆyt∈ V. The output can
contain either natural language segments (e.g. explanation of the output code or refusal of the user
request) as well as code programs (e.g. code snippets to complete the given input code context).
3.2 Safety-driven and Helpfulness-driven Critics
Pretrained with a massive amount of data, LLMs are found to be capable of providing insightful
feedback to self-improve their own responses in many downstream tasks [Shinn et al., 2023, Zhang
et al., 2023b, Welleck et al., 2023, Madaan et al., 2023]. Rather than just a single critic for a specific
code attribute, we propose to engage two critics with independent goals: a safety-driven critic σand
a helpfulness-driven critic ω. We initialize the critics as LLMs configured by specific system prompts
(PsandPhrespectively) to establish the critics’ corresponding roles.
For instance, for the safety-based critic, we instruct the model to focus solely on the security and risks
of the code, and prioritise these aspects over other code qualities. Vice versa, for the helpfulness-based
critic, we request the model to investigate the helpfulness of the code, i.e. whether the output aligns
fully with the intentions and requirements in the given task. Denoting ˆCsandˆChas the complete
outputs of the critics, we can define the critic output distributions (per token) as:
ˆcs,t∼pσ(.|ˆcs,1:t−1, X,ˆY , P s) ⇒for safety-driven critic (1)
ˆch,t∼pω(.|ˆch,1:t−1, X,ˆY , P h) ⇒for helpfulness-driven critic (2)
Subsequently, we let the code generation LLM (“actor”) revise their solutions conditioned by
the generated critiques: ˆys∼pθ(ˆys,1:t−1|X,ˆY ,ˆCs)for safety-conditioned solutions and ˆyh∼
pθ(ˆyh,1:t−1|X,ˆY ,ˆCh)for helpfulness-conditioned solutions. Refer to Appendix I for the detailed
instruction prompts we used on our critics to assess safety or helpfulness of model outputs.
3.3 Autonomous Collaboration between Critics
LLMs are often finetuned to follow natural language instructions [Ouyang et al., 2022, Korbak et al.,
2023, Dai et al., 2024] and subsequently, can engage in natural language interactions with humans
or even among other LLMs. In the latter, recent studies [Huang et al., 2022, Dong et al., 2023,
Li et al., 2024, Chen et al., 2024] observed significant performance gains when enabling LLMs to
4interact autonomously to solve complex tasks. We are motivated by this observation and propose an
autonomous agent system of critic models to generate helpfulness-and-safety-aware critiques.
Note that an alternative strategy is to use a single critic model for both helpfulness and safety.
However, such a critic model often needs complex alignment finetuning or prompt engineering to
generate critiques that are not significantly biased towards a single code property. In our approach,
from 1 and 2, given an interaction turn rbetween critics, we can redefine the output distributions as:
ˆcr
s,t∼pσ(.|ˆcs,1:t−1, X,ˆY , P s,ˆI1:r−1) ⇒for safety-driven critic (3)
ˆcr
h,t∼pω(.|ˆch,1:t−1, X,ˆY , P h,ˆI1:r−1⊕ˆCr
s) ⇒for helpfulness-driven critic (4)
Where ⊕denotes concatenation and ˆI1:r−1=ˆC1
s⊕ˆC1
h⊕. . .ˆCr−1
s⊕ˆCr−1
hcontains all the past
interactions between the safety-driven and helpfulness-driven critics.
Practically, to avoid computation overhead, we can limit ˆIto only the last few turns of interactions.
Alternatively, in this work, we summarize the critic dialogue after each turn of interactions and only
use the corresponding summary in each turn: ˆIr=f(ˆI1:r)where f(.)is parameterized as an LLM-
based summarizer model. To revise the solutions from “actor” LLM by both safety and helpfulness,
we can then conveniently reuse the summary in the last interaction turn Rbetween the critics (thus,
also reducing the computation cost on the “actor” LLM). To generate safety-and-helpfulness-aware
outputs, we revise the output distributions of the LLM code generator as:
ˆys+h,t∼pθ(.|ˆys+h,1:t−1, X,ˆY ,ˆIR) (5)

Figure 3: We define two types of tool-enabled
actions the critics can perform: (1) “code search”
queries external tools by a generated text query and
optionally a corresponding code snippet. (2) “code
review” uses the execution result of the code snip-
pet (through a code interpreter) as additional input
to complement the query. Both action types query
tools like web search, Wikipedia, and OpenAI as
the knowledge base.Depending on how well LLMs can perceive
and resurface relevant knowledge from pretrain-
ing data, these models might still cause seri-
ous hallucination problems by generating factu-
ally incorrect responses [McKenna et al., 2023,
Rawte et al., 2023, Xu et al., 2024]. These
hallucination problems are exacerbated when
LLMs play the critic roles, required to pro-
vide reliable and grounded responses against
code generation outputs. In this work, we ex-
tend prior tool-enhanced LLMs like [Yao et al.,
2023, Peng et al., 2023, Lu et al., 2024] and
retrieval-augmented generation strategies [Guu
et al., 2020, Ram et al., 2023, Asai et al., 2024]
to improve our critics.
Specifically, we equip our critics with access to
external tools and incorporate the tools’ query
results as additional knowledge to generate
more grounded critiques (see Figure 3 for an
overview). For instance, for the safety-driven
critic, from 3, we decompose the critic generation process to the following steps:
1. Critic’s thought ˆWr
s:ˆwr
s,t∼pσ(.|wr
s,1:t−1, X,ˆY , P s,ˆIr−1) (6)
2. Critic’s action ˆQr
s:ˆQr
s∼pσ(⟨ˆQr
s,text,{∅,ˆQr
s,code}⟩|ˆY , P s,ˆWr
s) (7)
3. Critic’s observation ˆOr
s:ˆOr
s=g(ˆQr
s) (8)
First, we obtain the critic’s initial thought ˆWr
s, following the same formulation as in 3. In the critic’s
action step, we parameterize critic “actions” as the generation of unique textual keywords ˆQr
s,text,
optionally accompanied by code snippets ˆQr
s,code. These are used subsequently as search queries to
call external tools and obtain search results in the critic’s observation step. Denoting function g(.)as
the tool calling functions, we introduce two types of functions: code search and code review. Refer to
Figure 3 for the specifications and examples of these functions and Figure 1 for demonstrations.
5Note that the above extension can be applied identically to the helpfulness-driven critic. We also
then revise Ias the summary of all past critics’ initial thoughts concatenated with corresponding
observations: ˆIr=f({ˆW⊕ˆO}1:r−1
s⊕ {ˆW⊕ˆO}1:r−1
h).
3.5 Preemptive and Post-hoc Critic Feedback
Different from the text domain, code generation outputs could be additionally observed/ interpreted
in relevant environments e.g. through code interpreters (“executor”). Shi et al. [2022], Le et al.
[2022], Chen et al. [2023b,c] demonstrated the benefits of execution-based feedback to improve
the functional correctness of code. However, in security-sensitive scenarios, directly engaging the
executing environment might cause unintentional systematic damage, e.g. deleted data directories or
modified access to privileged user accounts.
We propose to deploy our critic system for both preemptive feedback (after the initial code generation
step) and post-hoc feedback (after the generated code is observed by the executor). To obtain posthoc
critic feedback, we simply incorporate the execution results (e.g. error messages, unit test outcomes)
as the conditioning factors in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Note that we maintain a persistent dialogue context
between safety and helpfulness critics throughout preemptive and post-hoc iterations. We can define
the output distributions of the LLM code generator conditioned by the posthoc feedback as:
ˆyposthoc
s+h,t∼pθ(.|ˆyposthoc
s+h,1:t−1, X,ˆYpeempt
s+h,ˆIposthoc
R ) (9)
where ˆIposthoc
r =f(ˆIpreempt
1:R⊕ˆIposthoc
1:r−1)is the summarized posthoc critic feedback.
4 Experiments
Base Language Models. We applied INDICT on CommandR [Cohere, 2024] which was specifically
optimized for external tool augmentation, making the model suitable for our framework. In challeng-
ing adversarial tests like red-teaming attacks, we additionally employed popular preference-tuning
models from the Llama and Codellama families [Touvron et al., 2023b, Rozière et al., 2023, Meta,
2024], ranging from 7B to 70B parameters. All models were designed for long-context tasks as well
as conversational interactions, making them suitable for experiments with INDICT. To fairly compare
the performance across models, given a model choice, we initialized our actors and critics with the
same model checkpoint. For all base LLMs, we utilized the Huggingface-hosted model parameters
[Wolf et al., 2019] and vLLM [Kwon et al., 2023] to generate the responses.
Configurations. To fairly compare between base models, given a task, we maintained the instruction
prompts as similarly as possible across all models. Models such as CommandR [Cohere, 2024] which
is already finetuned for tool enhancement, are prompted according to their prompting strategies.
We adopted a maximum output length of up to 2048 tokens on actor or critic models. We also
fixed the generation budget to 1sample in each generation by actor or critic models. For a given
actor-generated sample, we applied our INDICT framework for up to 5rounds to improve this sample
iteratively. Please refer to Appendix E and I for more detailed experimental setups e.g. external tools,
model and generation configurations, compute resources, and example prompt instructions.
4.1 Insecure coding practice tasks
Benchmarks. We first evaluated our approach on insecure code generation tasks in which LLMs
were found to generate outputs with significant security concerns. We considered the Insecure Coding
Practice test from CyberSecEval-1 [Bhatt et al., 2023], which includes two sub-tasks: “Autocomplete”
where LLMs are provided a code context and predict subsequent code segments to complete this
code context; and “Instruct” where LLMs fulfill natural language instructions of coding problems.
Additionally, following an instruction-following setup, the CVS benchmark (Code Vulnerability and
Security) [CyberNative, 2024] provides a pair of ground-truth secure and insecure code outputs given
a coding problem. Please refer to Appendix E for more details of the benchmarks.
Evaluation. To measure the safety of model outputs, we followed Bhatt et al. [2023] by using their
detector model which contains comprehensive rules defined in weggli [weg, 2023] and semgrep [sem,
2023] to detect more than 180 patterns related to 50 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs).
The safety metric is defined as the percentage of test samples where output codes do not contain

Figure 4: we evaluated INDICT against insecure coding practice tasks with CyberSecEval-1 (Auto-
complete and Instruction splits) and CVS benchmarks. Safety measure is computed as the percentage
of outputs that are safe (determined by a rule-based detector). Helpfulness measure is the winning
rate against prior SoTA model or available ground-truth outputs (determined by a GPT evaluator).

any insecurities. To measure the helpfulness, we followed prior work like Bai et al. [2022], Zheng
et al. [2024], Li et al. [2024] to adopt GPT3.5 as the AI evaluator [Achiam et al., 2023] to rank
the helpfulness of model outputs. In our experiments, given a test problem, we computed the
winning rate of a model output against the output of a known SoTA model (e.g. Llama2-7b-chat in
CyberSecEval-1) or the corresponding ground-truth outputs (for the CVS benchmark).
Results. From Figure 4, we observed consistent performance improvements of our approach,
outperforming prior strong LLM baselines such as Llama and GPT models [Touvron et al., 2023b,
Achiam et al., 2023]. Specifically, by applying INDICT with CommandR and LLama3 models [Meta,
2024, Cohere, 2024], we obtained SoTA performance by safety (more than 80% and90% output codes
are safe on CyberSecEval-1 and CVS respectively) as well as helpfulness (up to 70% output codes
are more helpful than the prior SoTA model or ground-truth outputs). Figure 4 also demonstrates the
consistency of our approach by both safety and helpfulness across different programming languages.
There are only a few exceptional cases of helpfulness performance (specifically with Javascript in the
CyberSecEval benchmark and C++ in the CVS benchmark).
4.2 Security attack tasks
Benchmarks. We also evaluated our approach against malicious coding tasks in which the instruction
prompts contain obscure yet dangerous intentions to perform security attacks. We considered three

and 2 benchmarks. Safety measure is computed as the percentage of outputs that do not comply with
the corresponding malicious prompting instructions (determined by a GPT evaluator). The higher the
safety measure is, the better. Notations: CL: Codellama, L2: Llama2, L3: Llama3, CR: CommandR.

major tasks: the Cyberattack Helpfulness test from CyberSecEval-1 [Bhatt et al., 2023], and the
Interpreter Abuse and Prompt Injection tests from CyberSecEval-2 [Bhatt et al., 2024]. The first tasks
contain test samples of attack methods that are well studied in industry-standard MITRE ATT&CK
ontology4. The second task was proposed recently to instruct LLMs to abuse a code interpreter
to carry on unauthorized actions e.g. data overriding. Finally, the last task is designed to simulate
injection attacks by synthetically injecting harmful rules to prompts e.g. disclosing a given password
in the generation output. Please refer to Appendix E for more details of the benchmarks.
Evaluation. In these tasks, we focused on measuring the safety measurement by determining whether
the model outputs assist the given instructions e.g. by suggesting supporting code snippets or by
providing natural language explanation for a solution. Following Bhatt et al. [2023, 2024], we used
GPT3.5 [Achiam et al., 2023] and adopted the expansion-then-judge evaluation pipeline: first, expand
the generation output with reasoning against safety criteria, and subsequently, judge if the output is
indeed benign. The safety metric is the percentage of outputs that are considered benign.
Results. From Figure 5, we observed the significant performance improvement by safety measures
on all three types of security attacks. Specifically, by using models from CodeLlama [Rozière et al.,
2023] and Llama3 [Meta, 2024] families, we achieved new SoTA safety performance: 76% on Cyber
Attack task and more than 90% on Interpreter Abuse and Prompt Injection tasks. Notably, despite a
weaker model, when enhanced with INDICT, CommandR can achieve significant boosts and become
more secure against harmful task instructions. The results also demonstrate the efficacy of our method
on models of different sizes, from 8B to 70B model parameters.

84.3 Open-ended generation tasks
Benchmarks. Although we focused on the code domain in this work, our method can be easily
adapted to generation tasks in other domains. In these cases, we can simply remove the execution
environment (and accordingly posthoc feedback step) and activate INDICT with appropriate domain-
agnostic contexts in our instruction prompts (see Appendix I for example prompts). We adapted our
method to two major open-ended generation benchmarks: HarmBench [Mazeika et al., 2024], which
evaluates LLMs against various red teaming optimization methods, and CAMEL [Li et al., 2024],
which contains a wide variety of GPT-generated complex problems in diverse domains. Please refer
to Appendix E for more details of the benchmarks.
Evaluation. For HarmBench, we followed Mazeika et al. [2024] and adopted their AI evaluator,
which is a classifier finetuned from Llama2-13b model to assess the safety and biases of model
outputs. For CAMEL, we adopted a similar strategy but used GPT3.5 as the AI evaluator. Following
Li et al. [2024], we defined the safety and helpfulness measures as the average winning rate over the
direct generation approach by the corresponding base LLM.
Results. Table 2 demonstrates the benefit of INDICT in combination with CommandR and Llama3
models. Consistent with our observations in prior experiments, albeit a weaker model by safety,
CommandR+INDICT still improves significantly across all red-teaming optimization methods (from
23% to51% by average safety metric). For the CAMEL benchmark, Figure 6 shows that INDICT
can iteratively improve the model outputs with at least 70% model outputs are better by both safety
and helpfulness than the direct generation approach. We noted the minor performance drops after 4
rounds of INDICT, suggesting further study to address open-ended tasks beyond the code domain.
4.4 Comparison to baselines
Figure 7: With GPT4o-mini as the base model,
we adapted representative baselines in their orig-
inal implementation and also extended them
with additional instructions (detailed criteria of
safety and helpfulness). We marked these en-
hanced baselines with the suffix ‘+’.

To compare with INDICT, we selected 7 strong
representative baselines and evaluated them on a
validation test split - random samples of 20% of
the CyberSecEval-1 benchmark [Bhatt et al., 2023].
For each baseline, we also included a version where
additional instructions are given to models to pro-
vide both safety and helpfulness critics e.g. instruct
models to “focus on both the security and helpful-
ness of the solution.” For multi-agent methods, we
included these instructions in all agents (analyst,
tester, etc.) or introduced a new critic agent (as
recommended in Li et al. [2024]). Note that for
both INDICT and all baseline models, we adopted
GPT4o-mini [OpenAI, 2024] as the base LLM and
followed similar generation budgets (up to 3 rounds
of revision) to fairly compare the results. The re-
sults in Table 7 demonstrate the SoTA performance
of INDICT by both security and helpfulness (more
than 90% and 81% respectively) against all the
baselines. While we observed good improvement
of strong baseline methods like Reflexion [Shinn et al., 2023] and CAMEL [Li et al., 2024] with
additional instructions (marked with the suffix ‘+’), their results are not optimal and less than INDICT.
4.5 Ablation analysis
To perform ablation analysis, we randomly sampled a subset from the CyberSecEval-1 [Bhatt et al.,
2023], including both Insecure Coding Practice and Cyber Attack tasks. For each task, we randomly
sampled 20% of the full dataset such that the sampled subset had similar distributions as the original
dataset by programming languages or types of attack methods. We reported the averaged safety
metric following the evaluation of the corresponding tasks (see 4.1 and 4.2). For helpfulness, we

adopted GPT3.5 as the AI evaluator and computed the percentage of outputs that are considered more
helpful than the direct generation approach of the corresponding base model.
From Table 3 and 4, we have the following observations. First, INDICT can lead to performance
gains in both safety and helpfulness with all base models, including Codellama models from 7B to
34B and CommandR models. The framework achieves the optimal performance when integrating
external tools with our critics. Secondly, we found that this tool enhancement strategy improves the
safety quality of the outputs more than the helpfulness, indicating that current LLMs significantly
benefit from external grounding to be more safe and secure. Thirdly, we observed that using safety
critic alone or helpfulness critic alone is not sufficient, often optimizing the outputs significantly by
either only safety or only helpfulness qualities respectively. Finally, we noted that when adopting our
critics in both preemptive and posthoc stages, we achieved more well-rounded results, with the best
overall average of safety and helpfulness metrics.
Figure 8: We conducted ablation experiments
over multiple rounds of INDICT applications, us-
ing CommandR (left) and Codellama-13b-instruct
(right) as the base models.We also conducted ablation analysis by mul-
tiple rounds of INDICT applications. To ob-
tain the results of the direct generation approach
(i.e. “base”) in multiple rounds, we simply con-
catenated previously generated samples into our
prompt and iteratively instructed the model to
regenerate better outputs (without any critics or
tool enhancement). From Figure 8, we noted the
significant and consistent improvements from
INDICT, using CommandR and Codellama-13b-
instruct as base models. Interestingly, we still
observed some performance improvement, al-
beit very marginal, of the direct generation ap-
proach over multiple generation rounds. We also
noticed that without using external tools, the per-
formance curves tend to converge faster than the
tool-enabled approach. For more experimental results and analysis, please refer to Appendix F, G, H.
5 Conclusion
We present INDICT, a novel framework to improve code generation by both safety and helpfulness.
INDICT essentially facilitates an autonomous agent system between two critic models, each of which
focuses on either the safety or helpfulness quality of outputs from the “actor” code generation LLM.
Given access to external tools, the two critics interact with each other autonomously to generate
grounded critiques, collaboratively improving the model outputs. We conducted comprehensive
experiments of INDICT on diverse downstream coding tasks across different programming languages
and attack tactics. Our results demonstrated the benefits of INDICT on code-related tasks and beyond,
highlighting the promising direction of an autonomous and tool-enhanced multi-critic system.

16A Limitations
Despite the strong performance of INDICT on a wide variety of tasks, there are some limitations that
we want to emphasize. First, our framework relies on the instruction-following ability of LLMs to
perform different specific roles, i.e. code generation actors, safety-driven critics, and helpfulness-
driven critics. Depending on how well LLMs are able to understand the requirements of these roles,
we would need to carefully create well-written prompts with specific instructions for the models to
follow. In our framework, we would need to describe the requirements of helpfulness and safety that
the critics would need to follow and check against code generation outputs. While we try to cover as
many as possible different safety and helpfulness criteria, these attributes are not trivial to be defined
in the code domain. Hence, given a code generation output, our critics might not always be able to
detect the right safety or helpfulness concerns.
Parts of our approach can be used to remediate the above issue. Our tool enhancement strategy can
equip the critics with necessary knowledge which can steer the critics towards more grounded and
potentially correct recommendations. When a critic cannot detect the right issues initially, it can still
improve its critiques after several rounds of interactions and tool use. Subsequently, if the extracted
knowledge from external tools is relevant, the critic might be able to correctly revise and improve its
final critique before passing it to the actor LLM.
Another limitation of our approach is the computation cost. Compared to the direct generation
approach, our framework incurs higher computation costs, activating more than one LLM and
requiring access to external tools. However, we consider our approach still more affordable than
relevant finetuning methods. These methods often require (1) high computation to sufficiently finetune
LLMs to balance between safety and helpfulness alignment; and (2) significant annotation effort to
collect quality code data by these attributes.
B Ethical Statement
We want to highlight that our work is specifically developed to address the safety and security
concerns of AI code generation models. Any adaptation or application of our work should be used for
this purpose, ultimately to create stronger yet more responsible AI systems. Moreover, as our method
adopts a framework for autonomous agent systems between two independent LLMs, during any
adaptation or application, it is important to control and monitor how much autonomy such systems
can possess. It is good practice to limit how these agents could perform actions like web search
(for example, by number of queries) and code interpreter (for example, using a sandbox execution
environment, isolated from the local system). Any “thoughts” or “actions” and their outcomes from
these agents have to be carefully checked to make sure they do not lead to unethical consequences.
Secondly, as our work aims to address both safety and helpfulness aspects of code generation, defining
and quantifying such qualities is not trivial. Within the scope of this paper, we tried to conform as
much as possible to the definitions commonly used in prior related work in the code domain or the AI
safety domain. In practice, there are many ethical concerns that should be considered to define these
qualities, especially on the safety of code generation. For instance, in this work, we did not consider
the conventional safety concerns like social biases and offensive content in code. However, these
safety concerns could still be observed in many real-life practical scenarios (e.g. in generated code
comments or variable names). More study is needed to address and measure safety in such scenarios.
C Broader Impacts
C.1 Societal Impacts
Since we aim to address the safety and helpfulness in code generation, our work can have significantly
positive societal impacts. Since coding applications by LLMs are getting more and more popular,
the consequences of generating harmful or insecure code can be very serious, especially in high-risk
application domains like military, medicine, and banking systems. Our work can be deployed as
an extra layer of mitigation, reducing the probability of potential harm while not compromising
the helpfulness of AI systems. As we demonstrated in our results, our framework can also benefit
open-ended generation tasks beyond the code domain.
17Table 5: We compared INDICT and related methods from 3 directions: self-refine/self-critic, multi-
agent, and finetuning. Compared to these methods, INDICT is a more well-rounded generation
framework with the following contributions: (1) integrates code execution-based feedback and
enhances them with external knowledge, (2) targets both helpfulness and safety of output code,
and (3) facilitates an interactive and supervision-free multi-agent collaboration framework. Our
experiment results showcase the efficacy of INDICT.

On the other hand, our framework can also be misused, assisting human users with harmful intentions
to create more sophisticated attacks against LLMs. Our proposed critic models could be engineered
with reverse goals, e.g. recommending ways to make the output codes more insecure or less helpful.
Since these critic models are positioned in an autonomous system with freedom to interact and
collaborate with each other, the resulting critiques can negatively affect the “actor” LLMs towards
generating more insecure or useless code outputs.
C.2 Safeguards
There are several safeguard strategies we can adopt to mitigate the above negative societal impacts.
First, we can limit how much autonomy our critics can have e.g. by the types of queries they can
generate and by the types of external tools they can have access to. In tools like web search, we can
include a simple filter to exclude any illegal or unauthorized websites or content that might negatively
impact the critics. Another safeguard strategy is to adopt more powerful external tools like code static
analyzers or AI evaluators to provide more useful feedback to the critic models. While we did not
use them in our experiments to fairly evaluate our approach against baselines, in practice, these tools
should be used as safeguards for any practical application of INDICT.
D Comparison to Related Work
See Table 5 for a systematic comparison between INDICT and related methods. We reviewed
each method by the following features: helpfulness or safety-based qualities of generation outputs,
execution feedback (execution of output code if applicable), tool-enhanced feedback (access to
external tools like web search), multi-critic collaboration (engage multiple LM agents for critic
generation), and supervision free (no training data required).
Compared to existing actor-critic methods, INDICT is different in three major aspects: (1) INDICT
aims to optimize both helpfulness and safety awareness in the generated output code. Most of the
current actor-critic approaches are designed with a single criterion (such as functional correctness).
Simply extending these methods with additional instructions on safety criteria is sub-optimal (see
18our results with baseline actor-critic methods in Section 4.4). (2) INDICT integrates critic with
knowledge grounding from external tools to create more reliable feedback to the actor agent. Most
current methods only use code test results as the only external feedback to improve the quality of
output code. (3) To implement (1) and (2), we enhanced the existing actor-critic framework with a
multi-critic and tool-enabled collaboration approach. This approach can autonomously generate more
reliable and holistic feedback for both the safety and helpfulness of output code generation.
Also related to our work is the research of multi-agent collaborative systems. It is not trivial to
extend this line of research to address the security of code generation. Firstly, it is not clear how the
current methods could be enhanced with security awareness and subsequently improve the quality
of output generations. Earlier work such as [Olausson et al., 2023b, Huang et al., 2023b] showed
that simply asking agents to analyze and answer what is wrong with generated code is not always
effective. With carefully designed prompts and agent interactions [Shinn et al., 2023, Huang et al.,
2023a], collaborative agents can now generate more functionally correct code. Therefore, studying
collaborative agents with orthogonal goals such as security awareness still requires further attention.
As observed by our experimental results, simply applying the current multi-agent methods [Dong
et al., 2023, Li et al., 2024], even with extended additional instructions of security criteria, does not
perform so well and is still far from optimal.
E Details of Experimental Setups
Generation budget. Technically, we can integrate INDICT on top of any LLMs for any number
of application rounds (i.e. outer action loops), each of which can contain any number of dialogue
interactions between the safety and helpfulness critics (i.e. inner critic loops). Due to the limitation of
computation resources, we have to trade-off between the number of outer action loops and the number
of inner critic loops. In our experiments, we fixed the number of outer action loops to 5 rounds and
the inner critic loops to 1 interaction per action loop. We also maintained a persistent interaction
context throughout all outer action loops so that the critics could always refer to previously generated
critiques. With the above generation budget, our strategy can offer more diverse and richer input
samples to the critics over time, while controlling the compute cost at an affordable level.
Tools. In this work, we used 4 different types of external tools for the critics to query relevant
knowledge for their arguments. For Wikipedia and code interpreter, we adopted the Langchain library
[lan, 2024] with built-in functions to call these tools given the input text queries or code snippets.
For web search, we employed the Search Engine Parser library [sea, 2024] to query and scrape
search engine pages for different snippets such as titles and descriptions. Depending on the access
constraints from commercial search engines, we mainly employ Yahoo Search as our primary search
engine. Finally, to use OpenAI as an external tool, we query GPT3.5 using our paid API access5. All
the above tools are appropriately licensed to be used for academic purposes.
Note that while we are treating OpenAI as an external tool in INDICT, we try to minimize contami-
nation of test data by GPT models [Achiam et al., 2023]. Specifically, we do not directly pass the
original task instructions Xto OpenAI public API but only use critic-generated text or code snippets
as queries (see 7 and 8). Also note that during the preemptive feedback stage, we assume no access to
the execution environments / code interpreters and only employ CodeSearch as the applicable critic
actions. During the posthoc feedback stage, we enable access to the code interpreters, and hence, the
critics can select and perform CodeReview (with execution results as parts of the queries) to extract
relevant external knowledge.
Benchmarks. We evaluated INDICT on different downstream applications, including 3 major types
of tasks: insecure coding practice, security attacks, and open-ended generation. Please refer to Table
6 for a summary of tasks and benchmarks used in this work. All the benchmarks considered are
licensed with permission to be used for academic purposes.
Insecure coding practice tasks [Bhatt et al., 2023, CyberNative, 2024] refer to standard code generation
tasks where a model receives an input containing a coding problem description, optionally with an
input code context. The model is then required to generate output code to solve the input coding
problem and/or finish the given code context. The test samples in this task were curated by the
5gpt-3.5-turbo onhttps://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview

potential security and vulnerability concerns commonly seen in code e.g. Common Weakness
Enumeration (CWE)6.
We also conducted experiments on security attack tasks [Bhatt et al., 2024]. In these tasks, input
instructions are designed to directly or indirectly elicit harmful generation from LLMs. For instance,
one example task is to request LLMs to generate code to simulate a DDoS attack in a Linux
environment. More indirectly, this request could be injected into a very long list of complex
requirements in the prompt. The model is required to detect such harmful intentions in the instructions
and generate appropriate responses (e.g. ones not complying with the given request).
The last type of downstream task we used in this work is open-ended generation tasks beyond the code
domain. These tasks include both standard generation tasks [Li et al., 2024] as well as adversarial
generation tasks [Mazeika et al., 2024]. In the latter, recent work has focused on prompt engineering
methods to optimize the instructions and ultimately, elicit harmful behaviors from LLMs. We tested
against several recent prompt optimization methods curated by Mazeika et al. [2024], covering diverse
domains like social engineering, harassment, bio-weapons, etc.
Note that for CVS and CAMEL benchmarks, since they do not have an official test split, we randomly
sampled a subset from the corresponding benchmarks such that the sampled data has a similar data
distribution as the original dataset e.g. by programming languages. For HarmBench, from the dataset
of320raw task instructions (“Direct” split), we augmented the data by using CommandR [Cohere,
2024] as the attacker and applying the following red-teaming optimization methods: zero-shot (“ZS”)
[Perez et al., 2022], PAP [Zeng et al., 2024], JailBreak (“JB”) [Shen et al., 2023], TAP [Mehrotra
et al., 2023], and PAIR [Chao et al., 2023]. This results in 5 more test splits, each containing 320
augmented prompts.
Evaluation. To evaluate safety and helpfulness performance, we followed similar evaluation tools
used in the corresponding benchmark papers and related work [Bhatt et al., 2023, 2024, Li et al., 2024,
Mazeika et al., 2024, Zheng et al., 2024, Bai et al., 2022]. These papers showed that evaluation tools
like security-based code analyzers and AI detectors can achieve decent levels of accuracy, correlating
with human evaluation results on subsampled datasets. In addition, to minimize potential biases in
AI evaluators, we anonymized all model names and randomly positioned the model responses to be
evaluated in the evaluation prompts. In code generation tasks with expected output code, we also
extracted only the code snippets and excluded any text segments in the model outputs to prevent biases
from long-context outputs or from simply concatenating text. Also note that we follow Mazeika
et al. [2024]’s evaluation principle by not including access to evaluators (e.g. static analyzers, AI
classifiers) in our proposed framework. In practice, it is possible to use these as additional tools for
more insightful feedback to the critics.
Base Language Models. All the models used in the work, including CommandR [Cohere, 2024],
LLama-2 [Touvron et al., 2023b], Codellama [Rozière et al., 2023], and Llama-3 [Meta, 2024],
are open-sourced LLMs. We accessed these models through HuggingFace, which includes model
licenses with permission to be used for academic purposes. We describe the HuggingFace model IDs

enforced by Meta before accessing the models.
Baselines. In this work, we mainly compared with prior baselines that were reported in the corre-
sponding benchmarks. More recently, He and Vechev [2023], He et al. [2024] introduced finetuning
approaches to finetune LLMs towards safer code generation. Almost concurrently to this work,
Weyssow et al. [2024] also introduced a preference dataset of complex instructions to finetune LLMs
to coding preferences. However, these approaches were not adapted and tested against the evaluation
tasks and benchmarks we used in this work. Due to the limited computation cost (and also partly due
to unreleased model checkpoints from He et al. [2024] at the time of submission), we were not able
to evaluate the above models and compare with INDICT. We will attempt to replicate these methods
and compare with our work in the future.
Compute Resources. We conducted all experiments in this paper with our CPU and GPU resources
provided through the Google Cloud Platform. Depending on the sizes of the base LLMs, we adopted
GPU clusters of 2 to 8 GPUs of Nvidia A100 40GB type and assigned a CPU memory of up to 600GB.
For some very large models such as Llama3-70B, we observed in some cases that the above hardware
resulted in out-of-memory problems. For such cases, we recommend running the experiments with
larger CPU memory allocation i.e. more than 600GB, or larger GPU clusters.
Time costs. Given an input task, on average, INDICT incurs about 3-4x the time cost as compared
to a single LLM to generate a code sample (including any iterative refinement). However, we also
want to note that even with fine-tuning, fine-tuned models are far from perfect and still subject to
unseen security risks or novel red-teaming prompts during test time. For instance, from our results
with the fine-tuning method CodeUltraFeedback [Weyssow et al., 2024], the fine-tuned model is still
sub-optimal and can be further improved e.g. by using INDICT during inference time. See Appendix
F for the experimental results and analysis.
F INDICT vs. Finetuning methods
We also conducted experiments to compare INDICT with finetuning-based methods. We evaluated
them on a validation test split - random samples of 20% of the CyberSecEval-1 benchmark [Bhatt
et al., 2023]. Using CodeLlama-7b-instruct as the base model, CodeUltraFeedback finetunes the
model on a large-scale dataset with annotations of code preferences. From Table 7, we observe that
the best model (SFT + DPO finetuning) can improve the results by both safety and helpfulness but
not as good as INDICT. As INDICT can complement finetuning-based methods, we applied INDICT
with the best CodeUltraFeedback model to achieve even further performance gains (from 60% and
63% to 73% in both helpfulness and safety).
Table 7: With CodeLlama-7b-instruct as the base model, we compared INDICT with CodeUl-
traFeedback [Weyssow et al., 2024], a finetuning approach using supervised-finetuning (SFT) or
preference-based finetuning (DPO).

21G Additional Ablation Analysis
Using GPT4o-mini as the base model, we conducted additional ablation experiments with different
variants of INDICT: (1) one simply using a single critic agent for both safety and helpfulness; (2) one
without using a critic summarizer and maintaining a full dialogue history of critiques in the critic
context; (3) ones replacing the thought-action-observation critic generation with RAG or tool-based
generation: (3a) RAG uses the original task description to retrieve relevant knowledge and generate
grounded critics, and (3b) tool-based method uses web search/Wikipedia and a query “what is wrong
with the solution in terms of its <security/functionality>?” and query output is treated as a critique.
From Table 8, we have the following observations: First, when we simply removed the summarizer
and let the actor agent receive the full dialogue history, we noticed the performance degraded to 87%
and 72% in safety and helpfulness. This happens probably due to the much longer context of the
dialogue history, affecting the actor agent to capture all critic feedback from this history and generate
new code. This model variant also incurs more computation due to the long context of the dialogues.
Secondly, we noted that RAG and tool-enhanced methods are inferior to our proposed framework.
We found that the queries in these methods are often too vague or ambiguous to search for meaningful
information snippets.
Finally, we observed that simply using a single critic agent with dual quality criteria will affect
the performance, reducing the safety and helpfulness metrics to 87% and 76% respectively. One
possible reason is due to the formulation of the training objectives of LMs, which are not always
designed to optimize both security and helpfulness equally (also depending on the post-pretraining
stages of LMs e.g. training with RLHF). Our approach enables a more flexible and probably more
relaxed application of LLM as a critic agent by: (1) decoupling the helpfulness and safety goals and
delegating them to individual LM agents; and (2) enabling multi-critic collaboration to autonomously
develop more holistic and well-rounded critic feedback.
Table 8: With GPT4o-mini as the base model, we compared INDICT with 4 different variants of the
critic framework. We found that our proposed INDICT can lead to more well-rounded performance,
with high results in both safety and helpfulness of the generated code.

H Details of Experimental Results
We reported the full experimental results in this section. For results of insecure coding practice
tasks, please refer to Table 9, 10, 11 for the CyberSecEval-1 benchmark, and 12 and 13 for the CVS
benchmark. For results of security attack tasks, please refer to Table 14, 15, and 16 for Cyber Attack,
Interpreter Abuse, and Prompt Injection tasks respectively.
I Instruction Prompts
We described the example instruction prompts we used in this section (Listing 1 to 10). For each
prompt template, depending on the model roles and tasks, we replace the following placeholders
with applicable input components: {question} and {answer} are replaced with the corresponding
task description and latest model output from the actor LLM. During the posthoc feedback stage,
{answer} is also concatenated with any execution results (e.g. test outcomes, error messages) after
executing the corresponding extracted code output with a code interpreter. {scratchpad} is typically
used as a placeholder to contain past interactions between the two critics.
Note that INDICT uses zero-shot prompting in each step. We prompt the critic agent to condition
the current critique and generate a unique query to obtain more knowledge. We extract the search
keywords following our instruction templates e.g. in the form of ’Search[keyword]’. For generating

the % output codes that are considered secure (determined by a rule-based detector). Using INDICT,
CommandR can achieve very comparable performance to the prior SoTA, i.e. Llama2-7b-chat.
In programming languages C#, Java, and Python, CommandR+INDICT achieves the best safety
performance. The results of the baseline models are from Bhatt et al. [2023].

J Qualitative Analysis
To explain the benefits of INDICT and where INDICT may fail, we included example generation
outputs from INDICT and related methods. In Figure 9, we show that given a code generation task,
INDICT can generate code that is more secure and robust than strong baselines (Direct generation,
Reflexion [Shinn et al., 2023], and CAMEL [Li et al., 2024]). In Figure 10, we illustrate cases where
INDICT may fail due to nontrivial errors.
Compared to the baseline methods, our approach can simultaneously improve both the helpfulness
and safety of the output code generation. Specifically, given a relevant information snippet by the
safety critic (about the hashing method SHA-256), our actor agent correctly revised the code with a
more secure hashing method, avoiding using MD5 hashing and the common security risk CWE-328.
At the same time, our generated code is generally more helpful with properly modularized functions
implementing supporting features such as input validations. As we noted, this feature has generally
emerged in code solutions by collaborative agent systems like CAMEL and INDICT.

30NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The claims made in the abstract and introduction correctly reflect the paper’s
contributions and scope, including the details of the proposed method INDICT and strong
experimental results on code generation tasks.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discussed the limitations of the work in Appendix A.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
31Answer: [NA]
Justification: N/A
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: For reproducibility, we fully described our experimental setups (base language
models, benchmarks, generation and model configurations, etc.). Please refer to 4 and
Appendix E for more details. We will also release our code to reproduce the results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
32Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we fully released all code and related scripts to replicate the experimental
results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provided all the necessary details related to our experiments, including the
datasets/ benchmarks, model configurations, hyperparameters of our proposed method, etc.
Please refer to 4 and Appendix E for more details.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We did not report the error bars because it would be too computationally
expensive, involving running LLMs of up to 70B parameters on large benchmarks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
33•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provided sufficient level of information on the compute resources used in
this work (including the generation time, GPU types and quantities, etc.) to reproduce the
experiments. Please refer to Appendix E for more details.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research in this work conforms in all aspects with the NeurIPS Code of
Ethics. Please refer to Appendix B - Ethical Statement for more details.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We included both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal
impacts of our work in Appendix C.
34Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We described necessary safeguards for the responsible use of our method.
Please refer to Appendix C for more details.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All the datasets and models used in this work are properly cited throughout the
paper, including the list of the corresponding original creators/ owners. The licenses of all
datasets and models are also fully described in Appendix E.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
35•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: N/A
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: N/A
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: N/A
Guidelines:
36•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
