Abstract
Visual Grounding aims to localize the referring object in an image given a natural
language expression. Recent advancements in DETR-based visual grounding meth-
ods have attracted considerable attention, as they directly predict the coordinates
of the target object without relying on additional efforts, such as pre-generated pro-
posal candidates or pre-defined anchor boxes. However, existing research primarily
focuses on designing stronger multi-modal decoder, which typically generates
learnable queries by random initialization or by using linguistic embeddings. This
vanilla query generation approach inevitably increases the learning difficulty for
the model, as it does not involve any target-related information at the beginning
of decoding. Furthermore, they only use the deepest image feature during the
query learning process, overlooking the importance of features from other lev-
els. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, called RefFormer.
It consists of the query adaption module that can be seamlessly integrated into
CLIP and generate the referential query to provide the prior context for decoder,
along with a task-specific decoder. By incorporating the referential query into
the decoder, we can effectively mitigate the learning difficulty of the decoder,
and accurately concentrate on the target object. Additionally, our proposed query
adaption module can also act as an adapter, preserving the rich knowledge within
CLIP without the need to tune the parameters of the backbone network. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on five visual grounding benchmarks.
1 Introduction
Visual grounding is a challenging multi-modal task that involves localizing a specific object based on
a given natural language description. This task requires algorithms to comprehend fine-grained human
language expressions and accurately establish correspondences with the target objects. In recent
years, it has gained significant attention in research due to its potential for advancing vision-language
understanding, such as cross-modal retrieval [42, 30, 44, 9, 41, 43] and image captioning [14, 29].

Existing works in this field typically follow the object detection framework and incorporate multi-
modal fusion to tackle this task. Earlier studies [ 52,12,27,3,58] mainly focus on a two-stage
pipeline, which first generates a set of region proposals using object detectors, and then finds the best-
matched region by interacting these regions with linguistic expressions. However, the performance
of this method is limited by the quality of the generated region candidates. To address this issue,
some studies [ 48,47,4] adopt the one-stage pipeline, which removes the proposal generation stage.
Unfortunately, these methods make dense predictions with a sliding window over pre-defined anchor
boxes, resulting in sub-optimal performance due to the failure to capture object relations effectively.
Recently, some methods [ 17,7,10,21,8,36] inspired by the DETR [ 1] structure, which adopt a
standard multi-modal transformer framework to establish the multi-modal correspondence (as shown
in Figure 1 (a)). These methods predict bounding boxes of target objects directly from learnable
queries, eliminating the need for extra efforts to obtain candidates, such as region proposals or
predefined anchor boxes.
While these methods have shown promising results, their primary focus remains on designing
stronger multi-modal decoders. By contrast, much less work has been done to improve the learnable
queries, which have been gained extensive attention in the object detection field. The queries that
are inputted to the decoder in these methods are typically generated through random initialization
or by utilizing linguistic embeddings. We argued that this vanilla approach has two critical issues:
i)this target-agnostic query inevitably increases the learning difficulty of the decoder. ii)During
the query learning process, these methods tend to focus solely on the deepest visual features of the
backbone, overlooking the texture information that is crucial for the grounding task and present in
low and mid-level features, as emphasized by [15, 38].
Drawing from these discussions, this paper seeks to address two critical research questions: i)Can
we produce the target-related referential queries for the decoder to alleviate the learning difficulty
that the decoder faces? andii)How can we effectively incorporate the multi-level visual context
information into the query learning process? We believe that tackling these issues together would
promote the learnable query to more comprehensively and accurately learn the corresponding target
object information in the image for the visual grounding task.
Considering CLIP [ 34] carries rich visual-language alignment knowledge, thus we adopt it as the
backbone of our approach. Existing methods typically apply CLIP on the visual grounding by fine-
tuning its parameters, as CLIP’s training objective is to match entire images with text descriptions,
rather than capturing fine-grained alignment between regions and textual elements. This may risk
losing the general knowledge of CLIP and require significant computational resources. To tackle
the challenges mentioned above, we propose a novel approach called RefFormer. Our approach
incorporates a query adaptation (QA) module to generate referential queries, which provide the
decoder with target-related context (as illustrated in Figure 1 (b)). By strategically inserting QA
2module into different layers of CLIP, the query adaptively learns target-related information from multi-
level image feature maps, and iteratively refines the acquired information layer by layer. Furthermore,
our proposed Reformer can also act as an adapter, enabling CLIP to keep frozen and preserve the
original rich knowledge. It adopts the bi-directional interaction scheme, performs the multi-modal
fusion by incorporating a small number of trainable parameters, and residually injects new task-
specific knowledge into CLIP throughout the entire feature extraction process. Extensive experiments
conducted on five popular visual grounding benchmarks (i.e., RefCOCO/+/g [ 53,31], Flickr30K
[33], and ReferItGame [18]) demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) Unlike the previous methods that focus
on designing sophisticated multi-modal decoders, we further improve the learning process of the
learnable queries, a crucial aspect that has been overlooked in existing work. (2) We propose a query
adaption module (QA), which can adaptively capture the target-related context, providing valuable
referential knowledge for the decoder. (3) We conduct extensive experiments on five visual grounding
benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and potential of our method.
2 Related Work
2.1 Visual Grounding
Visual grounding aims to ground the target objects based on natural language descriptions by
understanding the given images and expressions. Early work [ 52,12,27,3,58] primarily focuses on
two-stage methods, which formulates the grounding task as a matching task. These methods employ
object detectors to generate proposal candidates and then identify the best-matched candidate based
on the matching score computed between each proposal and the referring expression. For example,
MAttNet [ 52] proposes to decompose the language expression into three phrase embeddings, which
are used to trigger three separate visual modules. While achieving successful performance, two-stage
methods heavily rely on the quality of the generated proposals. Based on this, some studies [ 48,47,4]
have been dedicated to one-stage methods to remove the proposal generation stage. These methods
typically fuse visual features and language features first and then densely regress the bounding box
on each position of the feature map grid. For instance, FAOA [ 48] incorporates linguistic embedding
into the YOLOv3 detector to establish a one-stage pipeline, balancing between accuracy and speed.
Recently, transformer-based visual grounding methods [ 17,7,21,23,57,40,50,8,36,10] have
emerged, which leverages the self-attention mechanism to effectively capture intra- and inter-modality
relationships and achieve improved performance. Among these methods, the mainstream approach
[17,7,10,21,8,36] adopts DETR-like structures to decode bounding boxes from learnable queries.
For example, Transvg [ 7] and Transvg++ [ 8] employ a standard multimodal transformer framework,
along with the REG token, to establish multi-modal correspondence and predict the coordinates of
the referring object. Notably, the performance improvement of these methods primarily arises from
the design of stronger backbones or multi-modal decoders. In this work, we focus on the design of
learnable queries, which have received considerable attention in object detection field.
2.2 Learnable Queries in DETR and Its Variants
In the object detection field, DETR presents an end-to-end object detection model that is built in an
encoder-decoder transformer architecture. However, it suffers from slow training convergence. To
address this issue, some follow-up works [ 55,19,49,45,20,26,24,54] solve this issue by optimizing
the learnable queries in DETR. For instance, Anchor DETR [ 45] directly treats 2D reference points
as queries, while DAB-DETR [ 24] further investigates the role of queries in DETR and proposes the
use of 4D anchor boxes as queries. In contrast to these model-level improvements, DN-DETR [ 20]
introduces query denoising training to mitigate the instability of bipartite graph matching, which is
further enhanced by DINO [54].
Additionally, similar research have been explored in other tasks [ 22,13,37]. For example, EaTR [ 13]
formulates a video as a set of event units and treats video-specific event units as dynamic moment
queries in video grounding tasks. MTR++ [ 37] introduces distinct learnable intention queries
generated by the k-means clustering algorithm to handle trajectory prediction across different motion
modes in motion prediction tasks.

Figure 2: Overview of RefFormer. It adopts a DETR-like structure, consisting of a query adapta-
tion (QA) module that seamlessly integrates into various layers of CLIP, along with a task-specific
decoder. By incorporating the QA module, RefFormer can iteratively refine the target-related context
and generate referential queries, which provide the decoder with prior context.
3 Preliminary
Considering the impressive vision-language alignment capability of CLIP, we take it as the backbone
of our method to extract image and text representations, and keep the parameters frozen during
training. The feature extraction process can be represented as follows:
Image Encoder. For an input image V∈RH×W×3, it is divided into Nnon-overlapping patches of
sizeP×P, where Nv=H×W
P2. These patches are then flattened into a set of vectors, represented
as{xi
v∈R3P2}N
i=1. Next, these vectors are transformed into token embeddings using a linear
projection layer ϕe(·). Furthermore, a classification token xcls∈RDis added at the beginning of
the token embeddings. Subsequently, the positional embeddings Evare incorporated, and a layer
normalization (LN) is applied. This process can be expressed as follows:
Z0
v=LN([xcls;ϕe(Xv)] +Ev) (1)
where [;] denotes the concatenate operation. The sequence of tokens Z0
vis then passed through L
transformer layers. Each transformer layer comprises two submodules: the multi-head self-attention
(MHSA) and the multilayer perceptron (MLP), with each submodule preceded by layer normalization.
¯Zi
v=MHSA (LN(Zi−1
v)) +Zi−1
v, i= 1, ..., L (2)
Zi
v=MLP (LN(¯Zi
v)) +¯Zi
v (3)
where Zi
v∈ RN×Ddenote the output of i-th transformer layer.
Text Encoder. Given an referring expression T, it is first transformed into a sequence of word
embeddings using lower-cased byte pair encoding representations Xt. The word embeddings are
bracketed with the [SOS] and [EOS] tokens, producing a sequence of length Nt. Similar to the
image encoder, these tokens are summed with positional embeddings Etand passed through the L
transformer layers to extract the text representations:
¯Zi
t=MHSA (LN(Zi−1
t)) +Zi−1
t, i= 1, ..., L (4)
Zi
t=MLP (LN(¯Zi
t)) +¯Zi
t (5)
where Z0
t= [xsos;Xt;xeos] +Et, representing the word embedding layer in text encoder.
4 Method
The framework is shown in Figure 2. In the following, we first describe our query adaptation module
in Section 4.1. We then introduce our decoder that decodes with referential query and training
objectives in Section 4.2 and Section 4.3. Furthermore, we extend RefFormer to dense grounding
task in Section 4.4. Finally, we provide a discussion in Section 4.5.

4.1 Query Adaptation Module (QA)
In this section, we propose a QA module (as shown in Figure 3) that can generate the referential query
to provide the decoder with the target-related context, thereby enhancing the decoder’s grounding
capabilities. Importantly, our approach incorporates multi-level features into the query learning
process, enabling the queries to capture more comprehensive target object information and can be
refined layer by layer. Furthermore, QA can also act as an adapter , eliminating the need to fine-tune
the entire parameters of the backbone.
Down-projection. Considering the image and language representations Zi

tobtained from
thei-th layer of the backbone, we initially use the MLP layers ϕi
vd(·)andϕi
td(·)to project them to
lower-dimensional features to reduce the computation memory:
Fi
v=ϕi

v),Fi
t=ϕi
td(Zi

Condition Aggregation and Multi-modal Fusion (CAMF). We randomly initialize Nqlearnable
queries Q∈RNq×Dl, where Dldenotes the dimension after projected. These queries are specifically
designed to capture potential target object context. Next, we concatenate these queries with the image
features and input them, along with the language features into the CAMF block. Specifically,
the CAMF block mainly consists of a cross-attention layer, which takes the image and query
features [Q;Fv]and language features Ftas the query respectively. This approach enables us
to not only incorporate the expression condition into the learnable queries Qbut also to extract
relevant information from other modalities, thereby facilitating the fusion of target-related cross-
modal features. Besides, we incorporate two learnable regulation tokens rv,rt∈RDlto modulate
the final output of each QA. This process can be formalized as follows:
¯rv,¯Qi
c,¯Fi
v=MHCA ([rv;Qi−1;Fi
v],Fi
t,Fi
t) (7)
ˆQi
c=LN(¯Qi
c) +Qi−1,ˆFi
v=LN(¯Fi

v (8)
¯rt,¯Fi
t=MHCA ([rt;Fi
t],Fi
v,Fi
v),ˆFi
t=LN(¯Fi

t (9)
where Qi−1represents learnable queries that output from the previous QA, while Q0are randomly
initialized. The symbol [; ]indicates the concatenate operation, and MHCA (, ,)andLN(·)denote
the multi-head cross-attention layers and layer normalization, respectively.
Target-related Context Refinement (TR). Following this, we feed the queries ˆQcand multi-modal
ehanced feature maps ˆFi
vandˆFi
tinto the TR block. First, we use the queries ˆQcthat have aggregated
conditions to interact with the multi-modal enhanced image feature maps ˆFi
v, refining the target-
related visual context within them.
Qi
v=MHCA (ˆQi
c,ˆFi
v,ˆFi
v),Qi=LN(MLP (Qi
v)) +ˆQi
c (10)
Moreover, for feature maps ˆFi
vandˆFi
tthat have aggreaged other modality information, we use the
self-attention to further enhance their target-related contextual semantics:
erv,eFi
v=MHSA ([¯rv;ˆFi
v],ˆFi

v=LN(MLP (eFi

t=MHSA ([¯rv;ˆFi
t],ˆFi
t,ˆFi
t),Gi
t=LN(MLP (eFi
t)) +ˆFi
t (12)
Up-projection. Finally, we utilize MLP to restore the channel dimension of the image and language
features back to their original sizes. These features are then passed as inputs to the next layer of the
5backbone in a residual manner. Prior to this, we utilize the regulation token to modulate the features
GvandGt, which helps prevent the multi-modal signal from overpowering the original signal.
ˆZi
v=ϕi
vu(Gi
v×σ(erv)) +Zi
v,ˆZi
t=ϕi
tu(Gi
t×σ(ert)) +Zi
t (13)
where ϕvu(·)andϕtu(·)denote the MLP layer, and σ(·)denotes the sigmoid function.
Finally, by iteratively performing the above process, the queries Qcan progressively focus on the
target-related context, and generate the referential queries to provide the prior context for the decoder.
4.2 Decoding with Referential Query.
Language-guided Multi-level Fusion. By inserting the QA at different layers of CLIP, the referential
queries can be adaptively updated using the multi-level image feature maps. Additionally, to enhance
the image features in decoder, we aggregate the multi-level visual features under the language
guidance to yield language-aware multi-level image features. Specifically, given a multi-level image
feature set {ˆZk
v}(including low, mid, and high levels), where k∈ K represents selected layer index,
we inject the language features Zlast
t(the final output of the text encoder) into each level of image
features using MHCA:
Htsos=ϕmt(Zlast
t),Hk
v=ϕk
mv(ˆZk
v) (14)
ˆHk
v=MHCA (Hk
v,Htsos,Htsos) +Hk
v, k∈ K (15)
where ϕmt(·)andϕmv(·)denote the linear project function used to map features to the same
dimension. Besides, Htsosrepresents the [SOS] token in Ht, which extracts the global information
of the text. Subsequently, the multi-level language-aware image features are produced by simple
concatenation, followed by a linear projection function ϕvml(·)to map to the original dimension:
¯Hvml=Concat ({ˆHk
v}), k∈ K (16)
Hvml=ϕvml(¯Hvml) (17)
Decoding. Following, we first initialize the queries Q′with the same size as the referential query
Q, and add them together to utilize the prior context in Q. Note that, to avoid interference from Q′
during the initial stage, we initialize Q′as an all-zero matrix. Then, we concatenate the queries with
the image features to interact with the language features to aggregate the condition information and
produce the multi-modal feature map Hmm. This can be represented as:
¯Oc,¯Hmm=MHCA ([ϕq(Q) +Q′;Hvml],Ht,Ht) (18)
Oc=LN(¯Oc) +¯Oc,Hmm=LN(¯Hmm) +¯Hmm (19)
where ϕq(·)is the MLP layer, which regulates the significance of the query Q. As the importance
approaches zero, the query degenerate into a vanilla query. Then, we feed the queries Ocand
multi-modal feature map Hmminto the MHCA layer to extract target embddings O∈ RNq×D. It
can be formulated as:
¯O=MHCA (Oc,Hmm,Hmm) (20)
O=LN(ϕr(¯O)) +¯O (21)
where ϕr(·)represents the linear projection function.
Grounding Head. We built the two MLPs ( ϕbox(·)andϕcls(·)) over the target embeddings O.
The final outputs consist of the predicted center coordinates of the target object, denoted as b=
(x, y, h, w )∈R4, and the predicted confidence score y∈ R2that encompass the target object:
b=ϕbox(O), y=ϕcls(O) (22)
4.3 Training Objectives
Similar to DETR, we employ bipartite matching to find the best match between the predictions {b, y}
and the ground-truth targets {btgt, ytgt}. In our case, the class prediction is confidence prediction
aims to estimate the confidence of a query containing a target object. To supervise the training, we
use the box prediction losses (L1 and GIoU), and a cross-entropy loss after matching.
Ldet=λiouLiou(bgt, b) +λL1||bgt−b||+λceLce(ygt, y) (23)
6where λdenotes the corresponding loss weight. Additionally, to encourage the referential queries in
every QA module to effectively focus on the target-related context, we also introduce the auxiliary
lossLauxthat is similar to the above objective function to provide supervision for them. The final
training objective can be defined as:
Lfinal =Ldet+λauxLaux (24)
where λauxdenotes the weight of the auxiliary loss.
4.4 Extend to Dense Grounding
In addition to object-level grounding, our method can easily extend to the dense grounding task
by incorporating a segmentation head. Specifically, similar to the MaskFormer [ 5], we utilize the
MLP to transform the target embeddings Ointo mask embeddings M∈ RNq×D. The binary mask
prediction si= [0,1]∈ RH×Wis then computed by performing a dot product between the mask
embeddings Mand the multi-modal feature map Hmmand followed by a sigmoid activation. During
training, we use the mask prediction losses (Focal and Dice), which can be defined as follows:
Lseg=λfocalLfocal(sgt, s) +λdiceLdice(sgt, s) (25)
where sgtdenotes the ground-truth mask.
4.5 Discussion
In this work, we aim to explore how to further optimize the learning process of queries. To reduce
the learning difficulties posed by vanilla query, we introduce a simple query adaption module to
adaptively capture target-related context and iteratively refine it. As illustrated in Figure 5, the
attention maps produced by each query adaption module consistently align with our objective: to
progressively focus on the target-related context and provide prior context for the decoder. It is worth
noting that while "multi-level", "adapter", and "self-attention" may be extensively applied in other
research fields, our approach aims to integrate them to address the challenges in visual grounding
tasks, instead of designing a specific module to achieve the mentioned functions individually.

V100 GPUs. The loss weight λiou, λL1, λce, and λaux, we set to 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.1. For dense
grounding, we set the parameters λfocal , andλdiceto 5.0, and 1.0.
5.3 Comparisons with State-of-the-art Methods
REC Task. For REC task, we compare the performance with the state-of-the-art REC methods, includ-
ing the two-stage methods, one-stage methods, and transformer-based methods. As reported in Table 1
and Table 2, our proposed method achieves the best performance. In particular, when comparing to
the transformer-based method Dynamic MDETR, which adopts the DETR-like structure and uses the
same backbone as ours, we can see that our method performs better with +0.53%,+1.90%,+1.62%
on RefCOCO, +1.11%,+2.44%,+6.21% on RefCOCO+, and +4.94%,+4.18% on RefCOCOg.
Additionally, under multiple/extra datasets setting, our method also surpasses recent state-of-the-art
methods that incorporate large language models or utilize more training data.
RES Task. Following RefTR [ 21] and VG-LAW [ 40], we also conduct the dense grounding
experiments and report the results in Table 3 in terms of mIoU. It can be seen that our model

achieves superior performance without extra deliberate design to dense grounding, demonstrating the
generalization of our method.
5.4 Ablation Studies
In this section, we conduct the ablation studies to verify the effectiveness the each part of our
proposed method on RefCOCOg. Following previous work [ 7,17,8], the visual backbone we apply
the ViT-Base/32.
Effect on the position of QA. As presented in Table 5, firstly, we can observe that removing the
QA would lead to a Sharp decline in performance, highlighting the effectiveness of QA. We then
explored the impact of QA’s position in the CLIP to determine where QA should be added. We
chose three groups for the ablation study: {4,8,12},{4,6,8,10,12}, and{2,4,6,8,10,12}. The
results indicate that performance is best when we use the {4,6,8,10,12}configuration. Therefore,
we default to this position in our experiments.
Effect on the layers of multi-level fusion. In Table 4, we analyze the impact of the fusion layers in the
decoder. We first conduct experiments using single-level image features, and then proceed with multi-
level features. The results show that utilizing multi-level features significantly improves performance,
demonstrating that low- and mid-level features complement high-level features. Additionally, using
the{4,8,12}achieves the best performance, which we adopt for our experiments.
Effect on the different backbone. In the first line of Table 6, we apply our method to single-
modal encoders, i.e., Swin-Transformer + Bert. The results demonstrate that our method is not only
applicable to multi-modal encoders but is also compatible with single-modal encoders.
Effect on the auxiliary loss. In the second line of Table 6, We experiment with auxiliary loss, and
the results demonstrate the effectiveness of auxiliary loss. By employing auxiliary loss, the reference
query can capture the target-related visual contexts more effectively.
Effect on learnable queries. In the third line of Table 6, we validate the effectiveness of the learnable
queries. Specifically, we replace the prior queries generated by the QA module with randomly
initialized queries or linguistic embeddings input to decoder while keeping other modules unchanged.
We can observe that introducing the prior queries can bring significant performance improvement.
This result demonstrates that prior queries aid the decoder in more accurately locating the target
object. Additionally, we investigate the accuracy of our referential queries, which are designed to
provide prior information to the decoder. Since the channel dimension in the QA module is lower,
the reference query may not accurately predict the coordinates of the targets.
Convergence curves. In Figure 4 we illustrate the convergence curve of our proposed method com-
pared to other open-source DETR-like visual grounding methods. Notably, our method demonstrates
accelerated training convergence, reducing the training time by half compared to the TransVG, while
also outperforming other existing methods.
5.5 Qualitative Results
As shown in Figure 5, the attention maps in the QA module illustrate the refined process of how
the referential query captures the target-related context. Initially, the attention map appears noisy
but gradually focuses on the target-related context, such as the couch in (a). By incorporating
the referential query, the attention map in the decoder accurately concentrates on the target object.

Figure 5: Qualitative results on RefCOCOg. The bounding boxes in green and red correspond to
predictions of our model and the ground truth. Columns 2-6 showcase the attention maps generated
by each QA module, while the last column represents the attention map from the decoder.
Besides, it is important to note that the referential query may not precisely focus on the target object
due to the lower feature dimension in the QA module, but it still captures target-related information.
6 Concluding and Remarks
In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called RefFormer that can be seamlessly integrated into
CLIP. The RefFormer can not only generate the referential query to provide the target-related context
for decoder, but also act as the adaptor to preserve the original knowledge of CLIP and reduce the
training cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and visualization
results illustrate the refined process of our proposed RefFormer.
Limitations : Although our method is specifically designed for the REC task and surpasses existing
SOTA methods in REC, there is still significant room for improvement in the RES task. This is
because we have not yet optimized our approach specifically for the RES task.

Figure 6: The performance of different numbers of learnable queries on RefCOCOg.
A.1 Effect on the RefFormer’s direction.
In RefFormer, the QA module can serve as an adapter, injecting specific knowledge into the frozen
CLIP model. In Table 7, we investigate the direction of feature flow from QA module. We find
that using a dual-direction approach achieves the best performance. Through QA module, language
features have aggregated relevant visual context information. As pointed to [ 25], incorporating rich
visual context into linguistic features aids in achieving strong vision-language alignment and better
indicating target objects.
A.2 Effect on the number of learnable queries.
We depict the performance in terms of Prec@0.5 according to the number of learnable queries Nq
in Figure 6. When we adopt the Nq= 3, the performance is best. However, further increases yield
only slight improvements in metrics, as a large number of Nqincreases the difficulty of the model.
Therefore, we default set the Nq= 3in our experiments.
A.3 Visualization
Due to space limitations, we present additional visualization results here. As shown in Figure 7, the
referential queries gradually focus on the target object and effectively provide target-related context
for the decoder. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims made in the abstract and introduction (Section 1) accurately
reflect our paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
16•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations of the work in the paper.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
17• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We fully describe the proposed model and implementation details in Section 4
and Section 5.2, and we submit our main code in the form of a zipped file in additional
supplementary materials.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We submit our main code in the form of a zipped file in additional supplemen-
tary materials, and we will release the complete code after review.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
18•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We describe the datasets, metrics and implementation details in Sec. ??and
supplemental material.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
19•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We only provide the GPU type in the supplemental material.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of
Ethics in every respect.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: There is no societal impact of the work performed.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
20•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: This paper does not use existing assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: This paper does not release new assets.
21Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
