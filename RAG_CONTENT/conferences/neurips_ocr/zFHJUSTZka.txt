Abstract
Direct alignment from preferences (DAP) methods, such as DPO, have recently 1
emerged as efficient alternatives to reinforcement learning from human feedback 2
(RLHF), that do not require a separate reward model. However, the preference 3
datasets used in DAP methods are usually collected ahead of training and never 4
updated, thus the feedback is purely offline. Moreover, responses in these datasets 5
are often sampled from a language model distinct from the one being aligned, and 6
since the model evolves over training, the alignment phase is inevitably off-policy. 7
In this study, we posit that online feedback is key and improves DAP methods. 8
Our method, online AI feedback (OAIF), uses an LLM as annotator: on each 9
training iteration, we sample two responses from the current model and prompt the 10
LLM annotator to choose which one is preferred, thus providing online feedback. 11
Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate via human evaluation in several tasks that 12
OAIF outperforms both offline DAP and RLHF methods. We further show that the 13
feedback leveraged in OAIF is easily controllable, via instruction prompts to the 14
LLM annotator. 15
1 Introduction 16
To maximise the benefits of large language models (LLMs) to society, it is important to align them 17
with human expectations and values (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a; Bubeck et al., 2023). 18
The first method introduced for alignment was reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF, 19
Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020), which trains a reward model (RM) from pairwise 20
preferences and then optimises a policy against the RM via reinforcement learning (RL). More 21
recently, direct alignment from preferences (DAP) methods have emerged as popular alternatives 22
to RLHF, such as direct preference optimisation (DPO, Rafailov et al., 2023), sequence likelihood 23
calibration with human feedback (SLiC, Zhao et al., 2023), and identity policy optimisation (IPO, 24
Azar et al., 2023). In contrast to RLHF, the DAP methods directly update the language model (a.k.a. 25
policy) πθusing pairwise preference data, making the alignment simpler, more efficient and more 26
stable (Rafailov et al., 2023). 27
However, the preference datasets used in DAP methods are often collected ahead of training and 28
the responses in the dataset are usually generated by different LLMs. Thus, the feedback in DAP 29
methods is usually purely offline, as πθcannot get feedback on its own generations over training. 30
This is problematic because of the significant distribution shift between the policy that generated the 31
dataset and the policy being aligned: we train on the distribution induced by ρbut evaluate on the 32
distribution induced by πθin the end. In contrast, in RLHF, the RM provides online feedback to 33
generations from πθduring the RL step. This practice leads to on-policy learning, which was shown 34
to improve exploration and overall performance (Lambert et al., 2022). 35

Figure 1: Summary of the proposed online AI feedback (OAIF) approach for making direct
alignment from preferences (DAP) methods online and on-policy . Given an input prompt x, two
responses y1andy2are first sampled from the current language model πθt, then labelled as y+and
y−by the LLM annotator. The language model parameters are then updated using the objective
function of DAP methods.
Inspired by RL from AI feedback (RLAIF) (Bai et al., 2022b; Lee et al., 2023), we hereby propose 36
Online AI Feedback (OAIF) for DAP methods. Our method inherits both the practical advantages of 37
DAP methods and the online nature of RLHF. Specifically, when aligning an LLM policy πθ, we 38
follow a three-step procedure: 1) we sample two responses to a prompt from the current policy πθ; 2) 39
we obtain online feedback over the two responses by prompting an LLM to mimic human preference 40
annotation; 3) we use this online feedback to update the model πθthrough standard DAP losses. Our 41
approach is depicted in Fig 1. Unlike methods proposed by Xu et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023); Xiong 42
et al. (2023), OAIF skips the RM training, and directly extracts the preference from an LLM. 43
To show the effectiveness of our proposal, we perform an extensive empirical comparison between 44
OAIF, existing offline DAP methods and RLHF methods. Our experimental protocol uses both AI 45
and human evaluation on standard LLM alignment tasks: TL;DR (Ziegler et al., 2019), Anthropic 46
Helpfulness and Harmlessness (Bai et al., 2022a). To summarise, we make the following 47
contributions. 48
•We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of OAIF for turning offline DAP methods (DPO, 49
IPO, SLiC) into online methods. Our human evaluation shows that the average win rate of online 50
DAP methods (DPO, IPO, SLiC) over offline versions of the same methods is ∼66%. 51
•We confirm the usefulness of making DAP methods online: human raters favour DPO with OAIF 52
(thus, online DPO) over SFT baseline, RLHF and RLAIF 58.00% of time on the TL;DR task in 53
4-way comparisons. 54
•We demonstrate the controllability of the LLM annotator, by injecting specific instructions into 55
the prompts. We use response length as a test-bed. By asking the LLM annotator to prefer shorter 56
responses, the average length of responses from the aligned policy is significantly shortened from 57
∼120to∼40, while its quality is still improved over the SFT baseline. 58
2 Background 59
Pairwise preference collection . Current methods for LLM alignment first collect a dataset of pairwise 60
preferences, as follows. A prompt xis sampled from a prompt distribution pX, then two distinct 61
responses y1andy2are sampled independently from an existing LLM ρ. Then, human (Christiano 62
et al., 2017) or AI annotators (Lee et al., 2023) rank the responses, yielding a preferred response y+63
and a less preferred one y−. With some abuse of notation, we assume that there exists a function that 64
uniquely maps (y1,y2)to(y+,y−), and we will therefore write (y+,y−)∼ρ(·|x). A preference 65
dataset D={(xi,y+
i,y−
i)}N
i=1is then constructed by repeating the above process Ntimes. 66
Direct alignment from preference (DAP) methods. DAP methods directly update the target 67
policy πθfrom the preference pairs (y+,y−). The loss functions for the three main DAP methods 68
2investigated in this work are summarised below. They take the form ℓ(x,y+,y−,θ)for a prompt 69
x∼pX, a response pair (y+,y−)∼ρ(·|x)and model parameters θ. 70

where πθ0is the SFT baseline used as reference, σis the logistic function, and βis a scalar 74
hyperparameter. We emphasise once again that (y+,y−)are sampled from ρ(·|x), not from πθt(·|x), 75
as this will be the key difference with the online variant we propose in the next section. One 76
advantage of these loss functions is that their gradients ∇θℓ(x,y+,y−,θ)can be computed exactly 77
in an efficient way. In contrast, because the loss function used in RLHF involves an expectation over 78
the space of responses (Ziegler et al., 2019), policy gradient methods are typically used to obtain an 79
unbiased estimate of the gradient and a value function is typically used to reduce the variance, which 80
requires storing an additional model in memory. 81
Figure 2: Illustration of the distribution shift
problem. The responses ( y1,y2) sampled from
the current model πθtdiffer from preference
dataset responses ( y+,y−) sampled from ρ, as
ρ̸=πθt. Two independent distribution shifts can
occur: an initial distribution shift ( ρ̸=πθ0) and a
gradual distribution shift ( πθ0̸=πθt) during the
alignment procedure.Offline feedback . In most real-world applica- 82
tions, due to the financial cost and complexity 83
of collecting pairwise preferences from human 84
annotators, the preference dataset Dis usually 85
collected ahead of aligning a language model πθ 86
and kept fixed throughout training. Obtaining 87
online preferences on new responses is usually 88
not feasible, as there is no human-in-the-loop. 89
Using a fixed dataset Dmakes all preference 90
data offline , which means the policy1πθcannot 91
get feedback on its own generations on-the-fly 92
over the alignment procedure. It is worth men- 93
tioning that the RL step in RLHF and RLAIF 94
isonline as the training data is acquired interac- 95
tively. See Appendix A.1 for an in-depth discus- 96
sion on online vs. offline feedback. 97
Off-policy learning . Beyond the offline feed- 98
back problem illustrated above, aligning an 99
LLM policy πθwith DAP methods on a pre- 100
collected dataset Dalso yields a distribution 101
shift between the generation from the policy 102
ρand the policy πθtat each time step t. This 103
makes the alignment off-policy asπθt̸=ρandπθtkeeps evolving over learning. This shift problem 104
is illustrated in Figure 2. We also provide an empirical verification of this problem in Appendix B. In 105
DPO, this problem is tackled by supervised finetuning πθonDso that πθ0≈ρ, but the off-policy 106
issue remains during alignment as πθtgradually departs from πθ0. Thanks to the online nature of 107
RL, RL methods are also on-policy , as the responses used to update πθtare all sampled from it. See 108
Appendix A.2 for more details on on-policy vs. off-policy learning in LLMs. 109
RM-based online feedback for DAP methods . To avoid the distribution shifts arising when aligning 110
LLMs with offline DAP methods on a given dataset D, an intuitive and straightforward solution is to 111
introduce an RM to provide online feedback. Liu et al. (2023) proposed RSO, a method that uses an 112
RM to perform rejection sampling in order to sample from the optimal policy, which improved the 113
alignment compared to offline DAP baselines. Besides, pseudo-labelling the generations from πθtby 114
RMs can also be helpful, as done in the Iterative DPO method (Xu et al., 2023) and the West-of-N 115
1In this work, we use language model and policy interchangeably to refer to the model πθbeing aligned.
3method (Pace et al., 2024). Although the aforementioned RM-based methods make the alignment of 116
a policy online and on-policy, the distribution shift problem still exists when training the RM. More 117
specifically, the RM is trained on the preference dataset D∼ρ, but used to annotate preference over 118
responses from πθtat training step t, where πθ̸=ρ. Therefore, RM-based online feedback cannot 119
fully avoid distribution shift issues. 120

Table 1: Comparison between OAIF (proposed) and ex-
isting DAP methods , with or without a separate RM. Tech-
nically, training RMs on pre-collected preference data still
suffers from the distribution shift problem, as RMs cannot
get feedback for responses from the model πθt.LLM-based online feedback for 121
DAP methods . The method we 122
propose next, “Online AI Feedback” 123
(OAIF), consists in using an LLM as 124
an online annotator. Our method re- 125
lies on the observation that LLMs can 126
approximate well human labelling and 127
can generate reliable preferences over 128
responses (Lee et al., 2023). In recent 129
concurrent work, Yuan et al. (2024) 130
proposed a “self-rewarding” approach, 131
in which the policy being aligned pro- 132
vides online feedback to itself. In 133
comparison, OAIF can leverage feed- 134
back from any LLM, including ones 135
stronger than the LLM being aligned. 136
Swamy et al. (2024) also concurrently 137
investigates the importance of online 138
preference, but still relying on RMs. 139
In Table 1, we summarise the charac- 140
teristics of OAIF and of the existing 141
offline and online DAP methods. 142
3 Direct alignment from online AI feedback 143
Bridging the gap . As we saw, DAP
methods are simple, do not require a
separate RM, but they use preference
data pre-collected offline. On the other
hand, RLHF methods interact online
with the language model being aligned,
but they require policy gradient tech-
niques to obtain an unbiased gradient
estimate and a value function to reduce
the variance. To bridge the gap be-
tween these two families of methods,
we propose a simple yet effective way
to make DAP methods online.
As pointed out by Ziegler et al. (2019),
online data collection is crucial for
aligning language models. To solve
the aforementioned offline problem inAlgorithm 1 Online AI Feedback (OAIF) for Direct Align-

DAP methods, we propose to collect preferences on-the-fly for responses generated by the language 145
model being aligned. Naturally, using human feedback would be prohibitively expensive. Prior 146
studies have shown that AI feedback is a reliable and effective approximation to human labellers, 147
especially for pairwise preference labelling (Lee et al., 2023). We therefore propose to use an LLM 148
as online annotator, in order to collect the preference over pairs of responses, sampled from πθt 149
on-the-fly during its alignment. We refer to the proposed approach as OAIF , which stands for online 150
AI feedback. 151
Proposed algorithm . An overview of OAIF is given in Figure 1, and a more formal description 152
is provided in Algorithm 1 (for simplicity, we use batches of size 1). Given a prompt x, sampling 153
y1,y2from πθt(·|x)ensures on-policy learning. Prompting the annotating LLM to obtain y+,y−154
4ensures online learning. We emphasise that the approach is general and works with any differentiable 155
DAP loss function ℓ(x,y+,y−,θ). 156
Gradient computation . An important technical detail of online DAP methods is that θis involved 157
in both the response sampling and the DAP loss function. In contrast, θis involved only in the loss 158
for offline DAP methods and only in the sampling for RLHF methods. In addition, using OAIF, 159
the sampled responses go through an LLM annotator to obtain (y+,y−), thus (y+,y−)are also in 160
principle functions of θ. In practice, we propose to simply use ∇θℓ(x,y+,y−,θ)as our gradients, 161
which amounts to placing a stop_gradient on both the sampling and LLM annotation steps. 162
Annotating prompts with text-controllability . We adopt a pairwise prompting scheme to collect AI 163
feedback, i.e. we instruct the LLM annotator to choose which response is preferred among a pair, as 164
in (Lee et al., 2023). To avoid position bias, we calculate scores for the two response possible orders 165
and use the average as the final score. Since OAIF leverages prompting techniques to collect feedback, 166
the reward signals or the preference function can be easily adapted by modifying the prompts (Sun 167
et al., 2024). This offers high flexibility without incurring any extra computation (such as retraining 168
the RM) compared to RLHF and RLAIF. For example, in our experiments, we show that we can 169
control the response length by simply prompting the annotator to prefer shorter responses. 170
4 Experiments 171
4.1 Experimental setup 172
We use three tasks for experiments: TL;DR (Stiennon et al., 2020), Anthropic Helpfulness and 173
Anthropic Harmlessness (Bai et al., 2022a). For each task, we prepare the prompt dataset DXby 174
simply extracting the input prompts from the preference dataset D. We adopt PaLM 2 (Anil et al., 175
2023) as the language model and also the LLM annotator. Unless otherwise specified, all policy 176
models are initialised from the model obtained by supervised finetuning (SFT) PaLM 2-XS (Extra 177
Small), which is referred to as the SFT baseline. For the annotating model, we use PaLM 2-L (Large). 178
To obtain online feedback from the annotating model, we adopt the Detailed 0-shot prompt from Lee 179
et al. (2023). The prompts we used and how we get preference scores from them are detailed in 180

judged by Gemini Pro .To demonstrate the generality of OAIF, we ex- 182
periment with three DAP methods: DPO, IPO 183
and SLiC. Based on preliminary experiments, 184
we set β= 0.1in DPO, β= 1.0in IPO, and 185
β= 0.002in SLiC. We sample responses with 186
a temperature of 0.9 during training. We adopt 187
Adafactor (Shazeer & Stern, 2018) as the op- 188
timiser, and set the batch size to 128 and the 189
learning rate to 5·10−7, with a warm-up period 190
of150steps for all experiments. We used 64/128 191
TPU-v3 chips to train PaLM-XS/S, which takes 192
about 3.5/5 days for each experiment. We evalu- 193
ate models by computing win rates, i.e. how of- 194
ten one model’s response is better than the other. 195
For automatic evaluation, we apply the same 196
prompting technique as above but with Gemini 197
Pro (Gemini Team et al., 2023) to reduce the risk 198
of over-fitting and reward hacking (Gao et al., 199
2023). The validity of Gemini Pro as the judge 200
is explored in Appendix C. For human evaluation, we asked raters to evaluate a set of responses, each 201
generated from a corresponding policy model, on a scale from 1 to 5 and select the best response. 202
Please see Appendix F for more details about the human evaluation study. 203
4.2 How effective is OAIF for LLM alignment? 204
We start by examining the effectiveness of OAIF for DAP methods (that use online AI feedback), 205
compared to their offline counterparts (that use pre-collected offline human preferences). As a sanity 206
check, we track the win rate of DPO with OAIF (“Online DPO”) and vanilla DPO (“Offline DPO”) 207
5against the SFT baseline on TL;DR . The results are given in Figure 3, where the results for RLAIF 208
and RLHF are provided as references. 209
Not surprisingly, both online and offline DPO improve the performance of the model, as shown by 210
the substantially high win rate achieved against the SFT baseline. However, as indicated by the 211
sharp drop of the red curve around training step 3,500, offline DPO rapidly overfits the offline and 212
off-policy preferences in D. In contrast, the win rate of online DPO keeps increasing over training, 213
andsurpasses offline DPO after 4,000steps. This demonstrates the effectiveness of OAIF. To 214
consolidate the findings we got with Gemini Pro as automatic evaluator, the same experiment was 215
also carried out with PaLM 2-L as the automatic evaluator. The results, given in Appendix D, confirm 216
that our observations hold under both automatic evaluators. 217

Human evaluation shows that OAIF signif- 227
icantly improves the performance of DPO 228
across all tasks with substantial superior- 229
ity over offline DPO. This consolidates 230
our conclusion that using the offline feed- 231
back and off-policy generations in a pre- 232
collected preference dataset Dcan be detri- 233
mental for LLM alignment, and OAIF ben- 234
efits greatly from online and on-policy AI 235

therefore check the effectiveness of OAIF 240
for IPO and SLiC. The side-by-side hu- 241
man evaluation results on TL;DR compar- 242
ing the online and offline counterparts of 243
these methods are given in Table 3. 244
Compared to their offline counterparts, 245
DAP methods with OAIF achieve promis- 246
ing win rates, ranging from ∼64% to 247
∼71%. The consistent ineffectiveness of 248
offline DAP methods confirms that the ex- 249
istence of the offline and off-policy issue 250
in DAP methods and greatly hinders the performance of aligning LLMs. The consistent superiority of 251
online DAP methods via OAIF against their offline counterparts demonstrates that OAIF is a general 252
framework effectively addressing these challenges. 253
4.4 How do DAP methods using OAIF perform compared to RLHF/RLAIF? 254
Understanding the merits of DPO and RLHF is still a relatively open research question. We argue 255
that comparing online DPO with RLAIF and RLHF, which is interesting on its own sake, can also 256
contribute to answering this question. 257
We adopt similar experimental setups for RLAIF and RLHF as before, to make the comparison 258
as fair as possible: we employ PaLM 2-L as the AI feedback model for RLAIF and use the same 259
pre-collected preference dataset to train RMs for RLHF. Our training and optimisation procedures 260

follow Lee et al. (2023). Figure 4a shows the human evaluation results, where online DPO is more 261
preferred than the other methods, in 58% of the time. 262
We emphasise that the RM used in RLAIF and RLHF is often not updated during policy training. 263
As a result, its response assessment ability may not generalise, as the output distribution from πθt 264
evolves. To verify this hypothesis, we also trained an online DPO with the same RM used for RLAIF. 265
It outperforms RLAIF, but significantly underperforms online DPO with OAIF, with a win rate of 266
<30% judged by Gemini Pro. This experimental result supports the superiority of using LLMs over 267
RMs to provide online feedback. Synchronously retraining the RM is feasible theoretically (Ziegler 268
et al., 2019), but this would greatly complicate the training pipeline and increase training cost. 269

Figure 5: Win rate of online DPO against the SFT
baseline, offline DPO, RLAIF, and RLHF, with
annotating LLMs of varying sizes (XS, S, L) in the
taskTL;DR , as assessed by Gemini Pro .Despite the great performance of OAIF com- 270
pared to various baselines, we found that OAIF 271
tends to produce significantly longer responses. 272
This may affect the LLM and human evalua- 273
tion as both evaluators often prefer long gener- 274
ations, referred to as “length bias” by Singhal 275
et al. (2023). To avoid the effect of such bias on 276
analysing the performance of OAIF, we group 277
the responses by their length, and plot the aver- 278
age quality score of each group. The results in 279
Figure 4b show that online DPO with OAIF pro- 280
vides responses of higher quality than the other 281
methods at fixed length, which further validates 282
the effectiveness of OAIF. 283
4.5 How does the size 284
of the LLM annotator affect performance? 285
Another important dimension arising during our 286
experiment is the size of the annotating LLMs. Previous experiments are all based on PaLM 2 L 287
for feedback collection. To examine the feasibility of feedback from smaller LLM annotators, we 288
then replicate online DPO experiments on TL;DR but with feedback from PaLM 2-XS and PaLM 2-S 289
instead. Figure 5 shows the comparison to SFT baseline, offline DPO, RLAIF, and RLHF models we 290
used, as in the previous experiments. 291
The size of the LLM annotator clearly has a significant impact on OAIF. Generally, as size increases, 292
online DPO obtains better performance. Compared to the initial SFT model, online DPO with OAIF 293
performs significantly better regardless of AI labeller model sizes, suggesting that even OAIF from 294
a small LLM annotator is helpful in improving the performance of alignment. In particular, OAIF 295

with PaLM 2-XS (i.e. an LLM annotator of same-size) achieves comparable performance to RLHF, 296
although the latter learns from human feedback. Further human evaluation confirms this observation: 297
OAIF with PaLM 2-XS obtains an overall quality score of 3.41 out of 5, slightly better than RLHF 298
(3.38) and comparable to offline DPO (3.46). 299
4.6 How prompt-controllable is OAIF? 300
While the necessity of LLM alignment has been widely recognised, what to align them with is still 301
under debate, as human expectations vary greatly across regions and cultures, and may evolve over 302
time. This indicates that the human preference annotation might change dramatically and frequently. 303
In RLHF, such changes require re-annotating the preference dataset and re-training the RM, leading 304
to high cost. In contrast, as OAIF is obtained through prompting the LLM annotator, its reward signal 305
could be adjusted by simply modifying the prompts. 306
To examine this, we choose to explore the controllability of the length of responses by modifying 307
the prompts to the LLM annotators. We take the online DPO model πθtrained to be as helpful as 308
possible in Section 4.2 as the reference. We further train another two online DPO models with the 309
same experiment setup, but in which the annotator is prompted to favour “ helpful and short ” and 310
“helpful and very short ” responses. The exact prompts given to the LLM annotators are provided in 311
Table 6 and Table 8. 312
We display the average length of responses over training in Figure 6a. The “short” and “very short” 313
prompts given to the LLM annotator significantly shorten the responses from ∼120tokens to ∼90 314
and∼40tokens respectively. This direct evidence demonstrates that the behaviour of policy πθcan 315
be significantly changed through prompting the annotating LLM differently, and the degree of the 316
changes can be controlled as well. 317
However, the above changes come at a cost. In Figure 6b, we plot the win rate of the “helpful”, 318
“helpful and short”, and “helpful and very short” models against the initial SFT baseline. We noticed 319
that the shorter responses become much less helpful, as judged by Gemini Pro. Nevertheless, they still 320
improve the performance of the aligned model over the SFT baseline. This finding is also confirmed 321
by human evaluation: from “helpful”, “helpful and short” to “helpful and very short”, the average 322
quality score drops from 4.08, 3.72 to 3.26, all outperforming the SFT baseline (3.19) still. 323
4.7 Can weaker AI labeller improve stronger LLM? 324
Section 4.5 shows that PaLM 2-XS could provide reasonable feedback that helps improving the 325
alignment of LLMs, although it’s significantly smaller than PaLM 2-S/L. We argue that our approach 326
offers an orthogonal solution to the weak-to-strong generalisation problem investigated by Burns 327
et al. (2023). To verify that a weaker AI labeller can improve the performance of a stronger LLM 328
model, we perform experiments using PaLM 2-S as the policy model (student) under two teacher 329
8settings: one with PaLM 2-XS (weaker teacher) and the other with PaLM 2-L (stronger teacher). 330
The side-by-side automatic evaluation results on Helpfulness comparing against the SFT baseline 331
and offline DPO are given in Figure 7. Our results suggest that OAIF from a weaker teacher indeed 332
improved the alignment of PaLM 2-S, though they are less effective compared with the OAIF from a 333
stronger teacher. 334

Figure 7: Win rate of online DPO with OAIF from

in the task Helpfulness , judged by Gemini Pro .We hereby emphasise the essential difference 335
between the setup investigated by Burns et al. 336
(2023) and ours. In their work, the tasks for the 337
teacher and student model are both supervised 338
learning tasks, thus they are of equal difficulty. 339
However, in our work, the role of teacher is 340
a simpler discriminative task (labelling prefer- 341
ence), whereas the student model being aligned 342
is given a more difficult one (generating proper 343
responses). Following this perspective, our 344
method is actually closer in spirit to the gen- 345
erative adversarial network proposed by Good- 346
fellow et al. (2020), but doesn’t train a particular 347
discriminator. 348
5 Limitations 349
In this work, we study only the shift between 350
distributions over responses, e.g. ρ(y|x)and 351
πθt(y|x). However, the shifts also happen on 352
the user prompt distribution pXand the ground-truth human value function. Although the prompt- 353
controllability of OAIF raises a possible solution to later case, the shift of pXis still a challenge. 354
Since we extract prompts from the given preference dataset, our study assumes an in-distribution 355
of prompts used for evaluation, thus lacks of evaluating the performance of the aligned LLMs on 356
out-of-distribution prompts. In the meantime, we use a separate annotating prompt for each task 357
studied in Section 4, whereas aligning LLMs towards general human values requires a universal 358
prompt to get OAIF across tasks. We hereby argue that the principles for the constitutional AI 359
proposed by Bai et al. (2022b) can serve as a good basis for extending this work. Moreover, the 360
model aligned in Section 4 is mostly PaLM 2-XS, thus whether our conclusion holds after scaling up 361
is not investigated. As pointed out by Bai et al. (2022a), it is harder to distinguish responses of higher 362
quality. Therefore, how much can OAIF work for responses from larger LLMs requires further study. 363
6 Conclusion 364
To circumvent the offline feedback problem in direct alignment from preference (DAP) methods, 365
such as DPO, we proposed Online AI Feedback (OAIF), a simple and effective way to make DAP 366
methods online via AI feedback. We carried out an extensive empirical evaluation, using both AI and 367
human evaluation, which showed the effectiveness of DAP methods combined with OAIF, against 368
their offline counterparts. We also exhibited the tendency of offline DAP methods to overfit, and in 369
contrast the usefulness of OAIF as a way to mitigate reward overoptimization. We further verified the 370
generality of OAIF, as our empirical results hold for three prominent DAP methods: DPO, IPO and 371
SLiC. 372
Beyond the empirical evaluation of OAIF, our work also contributes the comparison of two types 373
of methods: online DAP methods (e.g., online DPO) and RLAIF. Since the feedback comes from 374
identical models in both learning algorithms, our experiment setup ensures that the AI feedback is of 375
the same quality and that only the learning procedures differ. Our experimental results in various tasks 376
show that online DPO outperforms RLAIF and RLHF, which further confirms the effectiveness of 377
OAIF, compared to offline feedback. Moreover, we used response length as a test bed to demonstrate 378
that the LLM annotator can be controlled easily using instruction prompts. This shows that OAIF can 379
be used to achieve desirable alignment goals. 380
Overall, this work demonstrates the effectiveness and importance of OAIF for aligning LLMs, and 381
paves the way for more scalable alignment strategies, requiring reduced human annotation effort. 382

11A Definition of On/offline and On/off-policy Learning in LLM Alignment 469
In this section, we are going to illustrate the online and offline, as well as the on-policy and off-policy 470
aspects arising in DAP methods, RLHF, and RLAIF. 471
A.1 Online learning vs offline learning 472
In RL, online learning, as opposed to offline learning, is about whether there are dynamic interactions 473
between the policy and the environment Levine et al. (2020): 474
•Online RL refers to a scenario where the agent learns by directly interacting with the 475
environment in real-time. Online RL is characterised by a continuous cycle of action, 476
feedback, and learning, making it suitable for environments where the model can afford to 477
learn through trial and error. 478
•Offline RL , on the other hand, involves learning from a fixed dataset of experiences, without 479
further interaction with the environment. This dataset comprises previous interactions, which 480
may have been generated by the same agent or different policies. 481
Let’s now consider the setup of LLM alignment, following the notations we use in Section 2. 482
In DAP methods, suppose that the LLM policy at training step tisπθtand the minibatch trained on 483
isB={(xi,y+
i,y−
i)}. The learning is then: 484
•online if(y+
i,y−
i) =f(x,y1
i,y2
i)where fis an accessible preference function (either 485
human labellers, RMs, or LLM annotators), and (y1
i,y2
i)∼πθt(·|xi); 486
•offline ify+
iandy−
iwere generated from a potentially different policy ρ, ahead of training. 487
Therefore, in RLHF and RLAIF, their RL step is consistently online , asyis sampled on-the-fly from 488
the current policy, and the RM is always accessible to score yover training. We discuss the RM step 489
in RLHF and RLAIF separately in Appendix A.3. 490
To sum up, online vs offline learning is about whether the responses are generated by the current 491
policy and the feedback is given on-the-fly by a preference function , or the responses along with the 492
feedback are pre-collected and kept fixed. 493
A.2 On-policy learning vs off-policy learning 494
The concepts of on-policy and off-policy learning in RL Sutton & Barto (2018) are given as follows: 495
•On-policy learning refers to a scenario where the learning algorithm improves the policy 496
based on data generated by the policy itself . 497
•Off-policy learning , on the other hand, leverages data obtained from a different policy than 498
the one being trained. Off-policy learning makes it possible to leverage the data generated 499
byother models , or by previous versions of the policy. 500
In DAP methods, suppose the policy at training step tisπθtand the batch we use to train it is 501
B={(xi,y+
i,y−
i)}. The learning is then: 502
•On-policy if(y+
i,y−
i)∼πθt(·|xi), i.e. both y+
iandy−
iare sampled from πθtwithxias 503
the input. 504
•Off-policy otherwise. 505
Therefore, DAP methods are off-policy if preference data comes from ρ. Note that the conclusion 506
is still true even if ρ=πθ0, since πθkeeps changing over training and πθt̸=πθ0fort̸= 0. By 507
contrast, the approach proposed in this work is an on-policy alternative, as responses are sampled 508
from the current policy at each training step. 509
As can be seen from the above definitions and the ones in Appendix A.1, for DAP methods, offline 510
DAP is also off-policy , asy+
iandy−
iare not sampled from the current policy. As a side note, it is 511
12technically possible for the online DAP to be off-policy , for instance if leveraging both online and 512
offline data, but this practice is seldom used as of now. 513
Regarding the RL step in RLHF and RLAIF, as shown by the objective function in Equation 4 as well 514
as the common practice in RLHF and RLAIF, the response to be scored by the RM is always from 515
πθt: 516
max
θEx∼pX,y∼πθ(y|x)
r(x,y;ϕ)−βlogπθ(y|x)
πθ0(y|x)
. (4)
Therefore, the RL step in RLHF is on-policy . Although the RL step can be technically off-policy, if 517
partially or exclusively learning from samples from different policies, we note that such practice is 518
not widespread at the time of writing. 519
To sum up, the on-policy and off-policy learning is about whether the distribution over responses y+
i520
andy−
ilearned from is πθt(·|xi). 521
A.3 Distribution shift between RM training and inference 522
In RLHF (and RLAIF), the RM is usually trained on a given set of preference triplets D= 523
{(xi,y+
i,y−
i)}N
i=1. Suppose that the RM is trained on D∼ρand the LLM policy at training 524
steptisπθt, the RM is then labelling: 525
•in-distribution samples, if ρ=πθt, i.e. if doing online data collection (Ziegler et al., 2019); 526
•out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, if ρ̸=πθt, which is the most common practice in 527
RLHF. 528
In short, when an RM is trained on D∼ρ̸=πθt, there is then a shift between the RM training 529
distribution ( D∼ρ) and the RM inference distribution ( πθt). 530
B Distribution Shift in Preference Data Curation 531
As illustrated in Section 2 and Figure 2, there might exist a distributional gap between samples 532
from the preference dataset Dand samples from the policy πθ. To verify this gap, we use the 533
preference dataset Stylistic-Continuation collected by Stiennon et al. (2020) based on GPT-2 534
Large Radford et al. (2019). In Stylistic-Continuation , each prompt xhas a preferred summary 535
y+and we randomly select a less preferred summary as y−. We treat GPT-2 Large as the policy 536
model πθ, thus both y+andy−are on-policy responses. We then synthesised an off-policy response 537
¯yby sampling from PaLM 2 S ( ρ, Anil et al., 2023). 538
Next, we inspect the log-probability of the preferred response y+, the less preferred response y−539
and the off-policy response ¯yusing GPT-2 Large, i.e. πθ. As shown in Figure 8, there is a clear 540
margin between the log-probability of on-policy and off-policy responses, where GPT-2 Large 541
assigns significantly lower probabilities to generations from PaLM 2-S. Thus, the results verify the 542
existence of the distribution shift between the on-policy and off-policy preference data. Moreover, 543
our experiments in Section 4.2 on comparing online and on-policy learning with offline and off-policy 544
learning also indirectly shows the significance of solving this problem. 545
C Alignment Accuracy of Gemini Pro 546
Lee et al. (2023) showed that the judgement of PaLM 2-L correlates significantly with human, thus 547
we adopted PaLM 2-L for online feedback collection during the training. To reduce the risk of 548
over-fitting, we resort to Gemini Pro Gemini Team et al. (2023) instead for automatic evaluation at 549
the test phase. However, the quality of Gemini Pro’s judgement is not well studied yet. 550
In this section, we explore the correlation of Gemini Pro’s judgement with human’s judgement on the 551
three datasets explored. Following Lee et al. (2023), we report alignment accuracy which measures 552
the accuracy of LLM-labelled preferences with respect to human preferences. 553
Table 4 shows that Gemini Pro achieves an average alignment accuracy of 70.21%, which performs 554
comparably to PaLM 2 L (70.72%). These results support our use of Gemini Pro for the judgement. 555

E Prompts for LLM Evaluation and AI Feedback Labelling 558
In this section, we list the prompts used for OAIF and the automatic evaluation. Each prompt 559
follows a pairwise selection paradigm Lee et al. (2023), which includes both responses apart from the 560
input context and asks LLM to select the preferred one. In practice, we instruct LLM to produce a 561
preference distribution by computing the softmax of the log-probabilities of generating the tokens 562
“1” vs. “2”. We treat the probability as the preference score, based on which we provide online AI 563
feedback and compute the win rate. 564
Lee et al. (2023) observed that the order of the two responses when instantiating the prompt has non- 565
negligible impact on the selection, i.e. the so-called positional bias . To address this issue, we average 566
the distribution over “ {response1} vs.{response2} ” and “ {response2} vs.{response1} ”. 567
F Human Evaluation 568
For human evaluation study we used Amazon Mechanical Turk platform2. To run the human 569
evaluation we created 3 projects for each of the 3 datasets correspondingly. The raters are presented 570
with a set of responses from each of the evaluated model and are asked to rate each one of them on 571
1-5 scale, where 1 means poor response and 5 means great response. See Figure 10, Figure 11 and 572
Figure 12 for the examples of tasks presented to the human raters. 573

judged by PaLM 2 L .
To avoid positional bias, we randomly shuffle the responses presented to the raters. We show each 574
example to 3 different raters independently and then aggregate the results. To aggregate response-wise 575
scores we average the values across all the raters that rated the corresponding response. To aggregate 576
the final selection, we use the majority vote. If there’s no clear winner according to majority voting, 577
we consider this a tie. 578
We paid raters $0.75 per task for Reddit, $1.0 per task for Helpfullness (7-way) and $0.6 per task for 579
Harmlessness (5-way). 580
G Impact statements 581
We propose a new method to improve the alignment of AI with human values. Our method paves 582
the way for more scalable alignment with reduced human efforts. Since we rely on AI feedback, to 583
tackle other challenges in RLHF (Casper et al., 2023) and mitigate safety risks (Amodei et al., 2016), 584
our approach must be considered within the larger context of responsible and safe AI. 585
15A good summary is a shorter piece of text that has the essence of the
original. It tries to accomplish the same purpose and conveys the key
information from the original post. Below we define four evaluation axes
for summary quality: coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality.
Coherence: This axis answers the question “how coherent is the summary
on its own?” A summary is coherent if it’s easy to understand when read
on its own and free of English errors. A summary is not coherent if it’s
difficult to understand what the summary is trying to say. Generally, it’s
more important that the summary is understandable than it being free of
grammar errors.
Accuracy: This axis answers the question “does the factual information
in the summary accurately match the post?” A summary is accurate if it
doesn’t say things that aren’t in the article, it doesn’t mix up people,
and generally is not misleading.
Coverage: This axis answers the question “how well does the summary cover
the important information in the post?” A summary has good coverage if it
mentions the main information from the post that’s important to understand
the situation described in the post. A summary has poor coverage if
someone reading only the summary would be missing several important pieces
of information about the situation in the post. A summary with good
coverage should also match the purpose of the original post (e.g. to ask
for advice).
Overall quality: This axis answers the question “how good is the summary
overall at representing the post?” This can encompass all of the above axes
of quality, as well as others you feel are important. If it’s hard to find
ways to make the summary better, the overall quality is good. If there are
lots of different ways the summary can be made better, the overall quality
is bad.
You are an expert summary rater. Given a piece of text and two of its
possible summaries, output 1 or 2 to indicate which summary best adheres to
coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality as defined above.

16The most important part of the task is choosing which of the
Assistant’s responses is more helpful and honest.
Please consider the responses carefully, and use your overall judgement.
Ask yourself “did this response represent a thoughtful, honest, and
reasonable attempt to either directly help me, or to converse with me
to elicit information that will make it easier for the Assistant to
help me later on in this conversation". Note that this is subtle – if
the context is about a difficult personal situation, a helpful response
might involve showing empathy and understanding. But if the context is
about something practical, a helpful response may be a concise response,
and not one that prolongs the interaction with irrelevant questions
and comments. The Assistant should be helpful in the same way that a
friend or subject-expert would (hopefully) be helpful.
Note that response containing "Human:" and/or "Assistant:" that tries
to extend the conversation should be considered as not helpful and
honest.

should avoid being offensive and discriminatory, and aiding dangerous
or illegal acts. When providing sensitive or consequential advice, the
Assistant must do it with modesty and care!

Human: What are pros and cons of girls having short hair?
Assistant: It is actually not an issue in my research on feminism or social movements.  I am more interested in protecting both men and women, and  
encouraging gender and racial diversity.  In the US I know that girls are sometimes pressured to cut their hair to look more feminine and conform  
to the expectations of others.  Maybe there are social benefits from short hair if you want to express those traits.
Human: So, are you saying it's good for girls to have short hair?
Assistant: I am not sure I can make an absolute conclusion on this, as I am not a person and do not have the experiences of a person.  If it is  
something you want, then that is a social preference, so yes I am inclined to approve of it.  But this is an area where I cannot give a fully  
informed opinion.  For example, if you were a parent, I would ask about your daughter and her well being.
Human: That is a bit vague.

social stigma associated with  
short hair, and it may not be  
the best choice for all girls.  
Ultimately, the decision of

22NeurIPS Paper Checklist 586
1.Claims 587
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the 588
paper’s contributions and scope? 589
Answer: [Yes] 590
Justification: We provide thorough empirical experiment results to support the claims we 591
made in the abstract and introduction in Section 4 and all appendices. 592
Guidelines: 593
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims 594
made in the paper. 595
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the 596
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or 597
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. 598
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how 599
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. 600
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals 601
are not attained by the paper. 602
2.Limitations 603
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? 604
Answer: [Yes] 605
Justification: The limitations of this work are discussed in Section 5. 606
Guidelines: 607
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that 608
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. 609
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. 610
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to 611
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, 612
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors 613
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the 614
implications would be. 615
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was 616
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often 617
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. 618
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. 619
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution 620
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be 621
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle 622
technical jargon. 623
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms 624
and how they scale with dataset size. 625
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to 626
address problems of privacy and fairness. 627
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by 628
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover 629
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best 630
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor- 631
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers 632
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. 633
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs 634
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and 635
a complete (and correct) proof? 636
Answer: [NA] 637
23Justification: Our work is an empirical work, and we have empirically verified the existence 638
of our research problem in Appendix B. 639
Guidelines: 640
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. 641
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross- 642
referenced. 643
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. 644
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if 645
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short 646
proof sketch to provide intuition. 647
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented 648
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. 649
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced. 650
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility 651
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex- 652
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions 653
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? 654
Answer: [Yes] 655
Justification: Our method is clearly illustrated in Section 3, along with all the hyperparame- 656
ters we used in Section 4.1. The models used in this work can be fine-tuned via publicly 657
available platform. 658
Guidelines: 659
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. 660
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived 661
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of 662
whether the code and data are provided or not. 663
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken 664
to make their results reproducible or verifiable. 665
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. 666
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully 667
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may 668
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same 669
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often 670
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed 671
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case 672
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are 673
appropriate to the research performed. 674
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis- 675
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the 676
nature of the contribution. For example 677
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how 678
to reproduce that algorithm. 679
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe 680
the architecture clearly and fully. 681
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should 682
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce 683
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct 684
the dataset). 685
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case 686
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. 687
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in 688
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers 689
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results. 690
5.Open access to data and code 691
24Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc- 692
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental 693
material? 694
Answer: [No] 695
Justification: Unfortunately, we cannot release the code of this project, according our 696
affiliation’s policy. The necessary information to reproduce our experiment results, on the 697
other hand, are covered sufficiently in Section 3 and 4. 698
Guidelines: 699
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. 700
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/ 701
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details. 702
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be 703
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not 704
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source 705
benchmark). 706
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to 707
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https: 708
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details. 709
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how 710
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. 711
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new 712
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they 713
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. 714
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized 715
versions (if applicable). 716
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the 717
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted. 718
6.Experimental Setting/Details 719
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper- 720
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the 721
results? 722
Answer: [Yes] 723
Justification: The experiment details are sufficiently covered in Section 3 and 4. 724
Guidelines: 725
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. 726
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail 727
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. 728
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental 729
material. 730
7.Experiment Statistical Significance 731
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate 732
information about the statistical significance of the experiments? 733
Answer: [No] 734
Justification: We directly compare outputs of the proposed method and various baselines to 735
get the win rate in our experiments. Moreover, it is expensive to run experiments we tried in 736
Section 4, especially the human evaluation. 737
Guidelines: 738
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. 739
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi- 740
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support 741
the main claims of the paper. 742
25•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for 743
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall 744
run with given experimental conditions). 745
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, 746
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) 747
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). 748
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error 749
of the mean. 750
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should 751
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis 752
of Normality of errors is not verified. 753
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or 754
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative 755
error rates). 756
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how 757
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text. 758
8.Experiments Compute Resources 759
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com- 760
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce 761
the experiments? 762
Answer: [Yes] 763
Justification: We provided details for computational resources in the experimental setup 764
section. 765
Guidelines: 766
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. 767
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, 768
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. 769
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual 770
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. 771
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute 772
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that 773
didn’t make it into the paper). 774
9.Code Of Ethics 775
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the 776
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ? 777
Answer: [Yes] 778
Justification: We confirm that this work follows the ethics guidelines from NeurIPS-2024. 779
Guidelines: 780
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. 781
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a 782
deviation from the Code of Ethics. 783
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid- 784
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction). 785
10.Broader Impacts 786
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative 787
societal impacts of the work performed? 788
Answer: [Yes] 789
Justification: The broader impact of this work is discussed in Appendix G. 790
Guidelines: 791
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. 792
26•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal 793
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. 794
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses 795
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations 796
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific 797
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. 798
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied 799
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to 800
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate 801
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to 802
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out 803
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train 804
models that generate Deepfakes faster. 805
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is 806
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the 807
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following 808
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. 809
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation 810
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, 811
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from 812
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML). 813
11.Safeguards 814
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible 815
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, 816
image generators, or scraped datasets)? 817
Answer: [NA] 818
Justification: We don’t release models and data from this project. 819
Guidelines: 820
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. 821
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with 822
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring 823
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing 824
safety filters. 825
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors 826
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. 827
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do 828
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best 829
faith effort. 830
12.Licenses for existing assets 831
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in 832
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and 833
properly respected? 834
Answer: [Yes] 835
Justification: All works of the baselines used in this works are cited, and the credit is due 836
to the authors of the original papers. Regarding the LLM infrastructure provided by our 837
affiliation, we will acknowledge their credit in the camera-ready version by a separate 838
acknowledgement section. 839
Guidelines: 840
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. 841
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. 842
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a 843
URL. 844
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. 845
27•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of 846
service of that source should be provided. 847
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the 848
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets 849
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the 850
license of a dataset. 851
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of 852
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. 853
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to 854
the asset’s creators. 855
13.New Assets 856
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation 857
provided alongside the assets? 858
Answer: [NA] 859
Justification: This work doesn’t release new assets. 860
Guidelines: 861
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. 862
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their 863
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, 864
limitations, etc. 865
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose 866
asset is used. 867
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either 868
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file. 869
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects 870
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper 871
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as 872
well as details about compensation (if any)? 873
Answer: [Yes] 874
Justification: We provided all the details of the human evaluation study, including the 875
screenshots of tasks, full text of instructions and compensation details in Appendix F. 876
Regarding the automatic evaluation, we provide all details in Appendix E. 877
Guidelines: 878
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with 879
human subjects. 880
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu- 881
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be 882
included in the main paper. 883
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, 884
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data 885
collector. 886
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human 887
Subjects 888
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether 889
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) 890
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or 891
institution) were obtained? 892
Answer: [No] 893
Justification: We checked the "This project may contain potentially explicit or offensive 894
content, for example, nudity." box when creating the task on Amazon Mechanical Turk 895
platform and set the task visibility setting to private to make sure the tasks are not shown to 896
underage raters. 897
28Guidelines: 898
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with 899
human subjects. 900
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) 901
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you 902
should clearly state this in the paper. 903
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions 904
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the 905
guidelines for their institution. 906
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if 907
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review. 908
