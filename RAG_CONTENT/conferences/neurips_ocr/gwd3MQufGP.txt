Abstract
Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
greatly improved their abilities in image understanding. However, these models
often struggle with grasping pixel-level semantic details, e.g., the keypoints of
an object. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel challenge of Semantic
Keypoint Comprehension , which aims to comprehend keypoints across different
task scenarios, including keypoint semantic understanding, visual prompt-based
keypoint detection, and textual prompt-based keypoint detection. Moreover, we
introduce KptLLM, a unified multimodal model that utilizes an identify-then-detect
strategy to effectively address these challenges. KptLLM underscores the initial
discernment of semantics in keypoints, followed by the precise determination
of their positions through a chain-of-thought process. With several carefully
designed modules, KptLLM adeptly handles various modality inputs, facilitating
the interpretation of both semantic contents and keypoint locations. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate KptLLM’s superiority in various keypoint detection
benchmarks and its unique semantic capabilities in interpreting keypoints.
1 Introduction
Recent advancements in deep learning and natural language processing have facilitated the rise
of Large Language Models (LLMs) that display human-like fluency in text comprehension and
generation [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. By incorporating visual information, researchers have developed
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [ 8,9,10,11,12], specifically designed for visual-
language tasks, showcasing remarkable abilities in image understanding. However, these models
encounter difficulties in capturing fine-grained semantic details, particularly at the point level,
which are crucial for various real-world applications. The exploration of MLLMs for keypoint
comprehension remains under-explored in the literature.
Keypoint detection is a fundamental aspect of computer vision that supports various applications such
as controllable image/video generation [ 13,14,15], human-centric perception [ 16,17], and AR/VR
systems [ 18,19,20]. Initially, research in this field focused on closed-set problems, aiming to predict
the locations of predefined semantic keypoints of a certain object category ( e.g. human body). As
the demand for generalization grew, researchers started investigating the detection of keypoints for
novel objects by providing visual prompts ( i.e., a support image of a novel object with its keypoint
definitions) [ 21,22] or utilizing textual prompts ( i.e., keypoint names) [ 23]. Despite significant
progress in these areas, existing models still fall short of achieving genuine semantic comprehension

understand keypoints across different task scenarios: (a) Keypoint Semantic Understanding takes the
object image and a keypoint prompt ( i.e., the position of the target keypoint) as inputs, then generate
responses that interpret keypoint semantics; (b) Visual Prompt-based Keypoint Detection takes a
query image and a support image with a keypoint prompt as inputs and then outputs the corresponding

of keypoints akin to humans. These models primarily rely on direct learning of visual patterns for
keypoint localization through extensive data fitting, while neglecting semantic understanding of the
keypoints, thus leading to misinterpretation of the prompts and inaccurate predictions. Moreover,
the input-output structures are designed in fixed and predefined formats, restricting their usage to
predetermined methods and impeding the flexibility required for interfacing with users.
Motivated by the aforementioned challenges, this paper delves into a more comprehensive problem of
Semantic Keypoint Comprehension to evaluate the model capability of comprehensively understanding
keypoints both visually and semantically. As shown in Fig. 1, we investigate three distinct capabilities
via different task instructions: (a) Keypoint Semantic Understanding aims to infer the desired
keypoint semantics, given the target image and a keypoint prompt ( i.e., the position of the target
keypoint) as inputs. It provides the potential for an AI model with high-level visual understanding
and analytical capabilities, crucial for tasks such as structural comprehension, action recognition,
and medical image analysis. (b) Visual Prompt-based Keypoint Detection , also referred to as
category-agnostic pose estimation, takes a query image and a labeled support image with the keypoint
annotation as inputs and then outputs the corresponding keypoint positions in the query image. This
capability requires the model to acquire keypoint definitions from visual prompts, enabling it to
perform cross-class and cross-keypoint localization tasks using sample images provided by users.
(c) Textual Prompt-based Keypoint Detection , also known as open-vocabulary keypoint detection,
aims to utilize detailed descriptions of keypoints through extensive text for keypoint localization. The
keypoint detectors directly receive the human language guidance, facilitating keypoint localization on
arbitrary object and keypoint categories in a zero-shot manner.
We introduce KptLLM, a novel framework that utilizes an identify-then-detect strategy to address
the challenging problem of semantic keypoint comprehension. It formulates all three capabilities
depicted in Fig. 1, by first identifying the semantic meaning of keypoints and then detecting their
positions via a chain-of-thought approach, akin to human cognition. KptLLM is a unified framework
2that comprises four key components designed to accommodate various modality inputs and infer
both the semantics and location of the keypoint. Specifically, we first extract visual features of
both query and support images to obtain query visual tokens and support image features. Secondly,
we encode the support keypoint prompt, which describes the position of keypoint on the support
image, to generate keypoint prompt embedding. Thirdly, prompt-oriented features are derived by
integrating support image features with keypoint prompt embedding, and are utilized to form keypoint
prompt tokens. Lastly, LLMs take query visual tokens, keypoint prompt tokens, and task-related
language tokens as input, and then generate the semantic description of the target keypoint and
its corresponding position on the query image. By harnessing commonsense knowledge in LLMs,
KptLLM can assist in keypoint localization of novel object categories, potentially leading to enhanced
generalizability in performance. In addition, the chain-of-thought design elicits the powerful keypoint
understanding capabilities of LLMs, which helps to distinguish visually ambiguous keypoints ( e.g.
left and right arms). Extensive experiments demonstrate KptLLM’s superiority on semantic keypoint
comprehension, showcasing its unique semantic understanding capabilities in interpreting keypoints
and state-of-the-art performance in various keypoint detection benchmarks.
In summary, the contributions of this work are three-fold: (1) We pioneer the investigation of a novel
problem in semantically interpretable keypoint analysis, termed Semantic Keypoint Comprehension ,
which aims to enhance MLLMs with improved image understanding at a finer-grained keypoint level;
(2) We introduce KptLLM, a unified multimodal model that utilizes an identify-then-detect strategy to
effectively address three tasks of semantic keypoint comprehension. KptLLM underscores the initial
discernment of semantic significance in keypoints, followed by the precise determination of their
positions through a chain-of-thought process. (3) We demonstrate KptLLM’s superiority in various
existing keypoint detection benchmarks and its unique semantic capabilities in interpreting keypoints.
We hope our work could inspire future research on keypoint understanding and localization, while
also fostering enhanced human-AI interface in fine-grained visual understanding.
2 Related Work
2.1 Keypoint Detection
Keypoint detection, also referred to as pose estimation, focuses on localizing the 2D keypoints of
objects in the image. Traditional models for keypoint detection are typically designed for a single
category, e.g., human [ 24,25,26,27,28,29,30], animal [ 31,32,33] and clothes [ 34]. Based on the
localization strategy, existing methods are generally divided into regression-based methods [ 35,36,
37,38,39,40] and heatmap-based methods [ 41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51]. More recently,
methods that can recognize and localize keypoints for unseen object categories in the training datasets,
are gaining increasing attention from the community. Category-agnostic pose estimation [ 21,22],
also referred to few-shot keypoint detection, aims to estimate the pose of any category in query
images with visual prompts ( i.e., a few support images of a novel class and its corresponding keypoint
annotations). Another line of research explores open-vocabulary keypoint detection [23, 52], which
aims to localize keypoints based on text prompts in zero-shot settings. In this work, we investigate
semantic keypoint comprehension and propose a novel unified framework to comprehend keypoints
across three different task scenarios, including (a) keypoint semantic understanding; (b) visual
prompt-based keypoint detection; (c) textual prompt-based keypoint detection.
2.2 Multimodal Large Language Model
Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) [ 1,2,53,3,4,54,5,6,7], researchers are
exploring ways to transfer the formidable capabilities of LLMs into the realm of vision, developing
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [ 55,8,9,10,56,57,11,12,58,59,60,61,62,
19]. These models exemplify an autoregressive mechanism predicated on a transformer decoder
architecture [ 63]. The integration of visual representation from vision encoders [ 64,65] into the
domain of LLMs ushers a new era of visual comprehension and reasoning. Such integration is
predominantly facilitated through a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) that seamlessly transforms visual
features into the input embedding space of LLMs [ 10,56,57], or via a cross-attention mechanism
that attends to visual contents through a series of attention layers [ 55,8,11]. However, most of
these VLMs can only provide text outputs, inhibiting the complex applications requiring detailed
visual perception. VisionLLM [ 66] tackles a range of conventional vision-centric tasks by instruction

tuning LLMs. However, it may fall short of fully leveraging the comprehensive reasoning faculties of
LLMs. Kosmos-2 [ 67], Qwen-VL [ 68] and DetGPT [ 69] further exploit the power of LLMs to enable
user-guided detection. Moreover, GPT4RoI [ 70], Ferret [ 71], Shikra [ 72], and PerceptionGPT [ 73]
innovates by incorporating spatial boxes or masks as inputs and training with region-text pairs,
offering region-level visual comprehension. Notably, a concurrent work, LocLLM [ 74], utilizes
LLMs for human keypoint localization via textual description. In contrast, we take a step further by
enabling LLMs to comprehend keypoints of various objects via multi-modal ( e.g., textual or visual)
prompts under different task formulations. This advancement not only broadens the utility of MLLMs
for keypoint detection but also enhances interpretive depth, allowing for a more comprehensive
understanding and grounding across a wider range of visual information.
3 Methodology
This section introduces our proposed unified framework, referred to as KptLLM, which effectively
addresses three semantic keypoint comprehension scenarios. As illustrated in Fig. 2, KptLLM accepts
multiple images (query and support images) along with a support keypoint prompt ( i.e., the position
of the target keypoint in the support image) and textual user instructions as the input. The output
comprises both the response text and the desired keypoint position. Specifically, KptLLM comprises
four key architectural components: (1) A visual encoder that extracts features from both query and
support images (see Sec. 3.1); (2) A prompt encoder that converts support keypoint prompts into
prompt embeddings (see Sec. 3.2); (3) A prompt feature extractor that derives prompt-oriented
features from the corresponding image features (see Sec. 3.3); (4) A pre-trained LLM that processes
multimodal tokens for keypoint comprehension (see Sec. 3.4).
3.1 Visual Encoder
The Visual Encoder is designed to process two types of images in parallel: query and support images.
Generally, it receives an input image I∈RH×W×3and generates a feature map F=V(I)∈
Rh×w×d. Here, drepresents the feature dimension, and handware the spatial dimensions obtained
by downsampling the original image dimensions HandW.
Query Image. The query image represents the image that is to be analyzed. We extract its spatial
features through the vision encoder V, resulting in Fq. Following LLaV A [ 10], we apply a linear
layer to project Fqinto language space: zq=Linear (Fq). As a result, query visual tokens aligned
with the LLM dimension are obtained and fed to the LLM.
4Support Image. The support image serves as a reference example. We extract its spatial features,
which are represented as Fs. Unlike the query image features, Fsis not directly input into LLM.
Instead, it is processed by the prompt feature extractor to derive prompt-oriented features.
3.2 Prompt Encoder
In addition to processing images, we need to incorporate an additional prompt consisting of 2D
coordinates x∈R2, which describes the keypoint location within the image. Inspired by SAM [ 75],
we introduce a prompt encoder to adapt this prompt input to be aligned with the image feature space
F. The prompt encoder encodes the keypoint coordinates using a sine-cosine position embedding
(PE), followed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron ( MLP):
Fp=MLP(PE(x)). (1)
3.3 Prompt Feature Extractor
The Prompt Feature Extractor is designed to extract the prompt-specific features from image features.
As illustrated in Fig. 2, the semantics of the keypoint prompt directly correspond to the support
image. We initialize the prompt feature extractor with a two-layer transformer that incorporates the
cross-attention mechanism ( CrossAttnLayers ). This mechanism employs Fpas the query and Fs
as the key and value to extract keypoint-specific visual features indicated by the prompt:
zp=CrossAttnLayers (Fp,Fs), (2)
where zpdenotes the keypoint-specific visual features. In essence, compared with average pooling-
based feature extraction method [ 21], the prompt feature extractor is trainable and capable of
incorporating global image features to enhance keypoint identification. This is particularly beneficial
for distinguishing mirror-symmetric keypoints, such as the left and right eyes, which can be highly
ambiguous when relying solely on local image features. Our ablation study demonstrates the
performance improvements achieved through the utilization of this component.
3.4 Multimodal LLM for Keypoint Comprehension
Given a query image and an optional prompt specifying the keypoint of interest, our goal is to
generate textual descriptions and keypoint locations that convey fine-grained keypoint information
within the image. Recognizing the exceptional ability of LLMs in handling multimodal tokens for
different perception tasks [ 76,10,77,73,78], we further leverage LLM for keypoint comprehension,
which could effectively process various inputs: (1) the visual tokens zqof the query image, (2) the
prompt tokens zp, and (3) a sequence of language tokens t, which depend on the three semantic
keypoint comprehension scenarios.
Keypoint Semantic Decoding. We design the model to directly generate textual descriptions that
interpret keypoint semantics, following the standard approach used by LLMs for text generation.
Generally, the architecture of an LLM typically comprises Transformer layers ( TransformerLayers )
followed by a final Feed Forward Network ( FFN). The latent embedding u, which captures the fused
multimodal information, can be computed as:
u=TransformerLayers ([zq,zp,t]), (3)
where [zq,zp,t]denotes the concatenation of the visual, prompt, and language tokens. This embed-
dinguis then passed through the FFNand a Softmax function to generate the probability distribution
pover the vocabulary for the next token:
p=Softmax (FFN(u)). (4)
Keypoint Position Decoding. Inspired by [ 78,73], we introduce a special token, <keypoint> , into
the vocabulary. Consequently, the 2D keypoint position ycan be computed from the output latent
embedding ukptof the special token using another FFNprediction head:
y=FFN(ukpt)∈R2. (5)
Indentify-then-Detect (ItD) Strategy . Instead of relying on extensive data fitting to learn fixed key-
point localization patterns, we adopt an approach where the LLM initially identifies the semantics of
keypoints. Subsequently, a chain-of-thought process is employed to accurately detect the locations of
these keypoints. Experiments demonstrate improved performance compared to alternative baselines.
53.5 Training and Inference Details
To retain the learned general knowledge of the pre-trained LLM, we employ LoRA [ 79] for efficient
fine-tuning of LLM, while fully fine-tuning other modules of the framework. The training and
inference processes for different tasks are outlined below.
Keypoint Semantic Understanding. As shown in Fig. 1-(a), this task focuses on extracting semantic
textual information associated with specific keypoints within an image. The training objective is to
minimize the language modeling loss, computed as the cross-entropy loss over the vocabulary of the
LLM’s tokenizer. Specifically, the loss function is defined as:
L=Llm(a,ˆa), (6)
where ais the text response predicted by the model, and ˆais the ground-truth text response. During
inference, given an image provided by the user and the corresponding keypoint position as a prompt,
our model comprehends and generates the semantic meaning of the specified keypoint.
Visual Prompt-based Keypoint Detection. This task involves simultaneously comprehending the
semantics of keypoints, generating textual descriptions of this understanding, and precisely localizing
the keypoint coordinates, as shown in Fig. 1-(b). The overall training function further incorporates
the L1 loss for keypoint regression:
L=λ∥y−ˆ y∥+Llm(a,ˆa), (7)
where ˆ yis the ground-truth keypoint position, and λis the loss weight that balances the learning
of keypoint regression and text generation ( λ= 2 in our implementation). During inference, the
user provides two images: one as the query image for testing and the other as the support image
for reference. Additionally, the keypoint definition for the support image should be provided as the
support keypoint prompt. Our model then comprehends the semantics of the desired keypoint and
detects its corresponding position in the query image.
Textual Prompt-based Keypoint Detection. As illustrated in Fig. 1-(c), this task aims to accurately
localize keypoints based on the detailed keypoint descriptions. The loss function aligns with that
of the visual prompt-based keypoint detection. During inference, users have the option to provide
detailed descriptions of the desired keypoints or simply the keypoint names, based on which our
model can detect the corresponding keypoints.
4 Experiments
4.1 Experimental Setup
4.1.1 Datasets
In our experiments, we employ two datasets to evaluate the semantic keypoint comprehension in three
scenarios: (1) The MP-100 dataset [ 21] for both Keypoint Semantic Undertanding andVisual Prompt-
based Keypoint Detection : This dataset is a pioneering dataset for category-agnostic pose estimation,
which encompasses 100 different object categories with over 20,000 instances. The number of
keypoints varies across categories, ranging from 8 to 68. Following the protocols established by
POMNet [ 21], the dataset is divided into five distinct splits to ensure comprehensive coverage across
different model training and validation scenarios. Each split contains all 100 categories, with 70 for
training, 10 for validation, and 20 for testing. The splits are carefully designed to avoid category
overlap, maintaining the independence and integrity of training and testing scenarios.
(2) The AP-10K dataset [32] for Textual Prompt-based Keypoint Detection : The dataset comprises
23 animal families and 54 species, totaling 10,015 images. Each image is annotated with 17 keypoints,
including two eyes, one nose, one neck, two shoulders, two elbows, two knees, two hips, four paws,
and one tail. We follow CLAMP [ 23] to assess the models’ ability to generalize to previously unseen
animal species within a zero-shot learning paradigm. We establish two experimental scenarios based
on the taxonomic relationship between the species in the training and test sets—specifically, whether
they belong to the same animal order. Species within the same order typically share similar visual
characteristics, whereas those from different orders exhibit greater diversity in appearance. These
scenarios enable us to assess how different methods perform when generalizing to unseen species
under varying conditions. Following CLAMP, we assign Bovidae and Canidae as the training and

4.1.2 Evaluation & Metrics
Different evaluation methods and metrics are used for different tasks of semantic keypoint compre-
hension. (1) Keypoint Semantic Undertanding : We use the MP-100 dataset [ 21] (Split-1), with the
keypoint semantic labels adopted from X-Pose [ 52]. Some keypoints are excluded from the evaluation
due to ambiguity or inadequacy in their descriptions, such as those used to describe the collar in the
clothing category. By aggregating the results of tested keypoints, we derive corresponding accuracy
rates (%). (2) Visual Prompt-based Keypoint Detection : We employ the Probability of Correct
Keypoint (PCK) metric, which is the standard evaluation measure for this task. Consistent with
POMNet [ 21], we uniformly set the PCK threshold to 0.2 across all categories. Additionally, we
compute and report the average PCK over all five data splits to provide a comprehensive indication of
the model’s overall effectiveness. (3) Textual Prompt-based Keypoint Detection : Following CLAMP,
we employ average precision (AP) as the primary metric for AP-10K. This metric is computed based
on the object keypoint similarity (OKS). For detailed protocol definitions, please refer to [24].
4.1.3 Implementation Details
Architecture. We utilize LLaV A-V1.5-7B [ 10] as our base model, which incorporates the ViT-based
visual encoder of CLIP for image encoding and Vicuna-7B (fine-tuned from Llama-2) as the LLM
backbone. We employ LoRA for efficient fine-tuning LLM. Instead, all other modules, including the
visual encoder, prompt encoder, prompt feature extractor, and a series of linear layers and feed forward
networks, undergo full fine-tuning. The input image only contains a single object of interest, cropped
according to the ground-truth bounding box and resized to 336 ×336, consistent with CLIP-ViT-L.
Training Details. LoRA parameters are configured with a rank of 128 and an alpha of 256. Optimiza-
tion is conducted using AdamW, with a learning rate of 2e −4 and weight decay of 0. We utilize 8
NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs for training, and use the DeepSpeed engine to enhance training efficiency.
Each GPU operates with a batch size of 16, and we employ a gradient accumulation step of 1.

LLaV A [ 10]. We report the performance of both the
original LLaV A model and a version fine-tuned on the
MP-100 dataset. The original LLaV A performs notably
poorly in grasping keypoint semantics, indicating the
inadequacy of traditional multimodal large language models in capturing fine-grained semantic details.
Conversely, the fine-tuned LLaV A demonstrates significantly enhanced performance, thereby validat-
ing the efficacy of our training pipeline. Furthermore, our KptLLM surpasses the fine-tuned LLaV A
by a substantial margin, particularly in terms of keypoint accuracy (83% vs 72%). It demonstrates
the effectiveness of our keypoint prompt token in guiding attention to the fine-grained keypoint area.

4.3 Visual Prompt-based Keypoint Detection
1-shot & 5-shot Evaluation . We compare our method with the previous visual prompt-based methods
ProtoNet [ 80], MAML [ 81], Fine-tune [ 82], POMNet [ 21], and CapeFormer [ 22]. Tab. 2 presents the
PCK results of different approaches on the MP-100 dataset under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings.
Compared with previous methods, KptLLM showcases the potential of MLLM in detecting keypoints
through the use of visual prompts, consistently outperforming across all settings and data splits. More
importantly, we integrate keypoint semantic understanding into the output response, introducing
novel functionalities for comprehending the semantic aspects of support image keypoints.
Cross Super Category Evaluation. To thoroughly assess generalization across markedly different
categories, we conduct a cross-supercategory evaluation following the protocol of POMNet [ 21].
While the MP-100 dataset ensures that training, validation, and test categories are non-overlapping,
some categories may still exhibit similar features, e.g., body characteristics commonly shared among
different quadruped animals. To address this, we designate four supercategories—human face, human
body, vehicle, and furniture—from the MP-100 dataset as test categories. The remaining categories
are utilized for training, allowing us to better evaluate the model’s ability to generalize across
significantly diverse categories. As shown in Tab. 3, KptLLM consistently outperforms previous
methods, highlighting the robustness and excellent generalization ability of our proposed method.
Qualitative Results. For the visual prompt-based keypoint detection task, the input necessitates a
support image of the object to be tested, as well as keypoint positions that represent the definitions of
those keypoints. In this study, we examine how the visual disparity between support images and query
images affects the model’s performance. As depicted in Fig. 3, our model is capable of effectively
detecting keypoints in various query images when provided with the same support image and its
corresponding keypoints. This effectiveness is maintained even in the presence of differences in
object poses, appearances, and environmental conditions.

4.4 Textual Prompt-based Keypoint Detection
The results are presented in Tab. 4. Compared to previous textual prompt-based model-CLAMP [ 23],
KptLLM achieves superior cross-species generalization. Specifically, our model demonstrates a 15.3
average precision (AP) improvement in the different order setting and a 21.8AP increase in the same
order setting. Notably, our model performs better in the same order setting, where species often share
similar visual characteristics. Overall, we show that leveraging detailed keypoint descriptions through
comprehensive text, combined with commonsense knowledge from LLMs, effectively enhances
generalizable performance in keypoint localization.
4.5 Ablation Study
In this subsection, we perform ablation study on the design choices of our model. The experiments
are conducted on the visual prompt-based keypoint detection task using the MP-100 Split-1 setting
with the PCK metric reported.
Indentify-then-Detect (ItD) Strategy. KptLLM follows the identify-then-detect paradigm, where
the model learns to first interpret the semantic information of the keypoint to be detected, and then
predict the precise location of the keypoint. In Tab. 5, we validate the effectiveness of our ItD strategy.
We observe notable enhancement, which can be attributed to the inter-task synergy that arises from
the ItD mechanism.
Prompt Feature Extractor. In Tab. 6, we compare our prompt feature extractor (Sec. 3.3) with
the average pooling based feature extraction method [ 21]. The results show that our prompt feature
extractor significantly outperforms the baseline method ( 91.66vs89.78), which validates the efficacy
of our prompt feature extractor in enhancing focus on fine-grained keypoint areas.
Combining Visual and Textual Prompts. In Tab. 7, rather than relying solely on the visual
prompt for localization, we further incorporate the textual prompt to demonstrate the effect of this
combination. The improved results indicate that the textual prompt could provide valuable high-level
and semantically rich guidance, enhancing keypoint localization.
5 Conclusion
This paper introduces the novel challenge of Semantic Keypoint Comprehension , which aims to
comprehend keypoints across different task scenarios. To address this challenge, we present KptLLM,
a novel and unified multimodal large language model designed to adeptly process various modality
inputs, facilitating the interpretation of both semantic contents and keypoint locations. Extensive
experiments show the superiority of our model in three different tasks for comprehending keypoints,
including keypoint semantic understanding, visual prompt-based keypoint detection, and textual
prompt-based keypoint detection. We hope this work can open up new possibilities for more fine-
grained multimodal vision-language understanding and provide valuable insights for future research.
96 Discussion
Limitations. (1) A major limitation of our work is the model’s size and computational efficiency,
which is a common challenge for MLLMs compared to traditional vision models. However, this is
acceptable because, as a pioneering effort in utilizing LLMs for keypoint comprehension, our main
contribution is demonstrating the potential of LLMs to understand and locate pixel-level details at
keypoints. (2) Additionally, the datasets used in our experiments have constraints in the diversity of
object and keypoint categories for both training and testing. This highlights the need to expand these
datasets to validate the model’s applicability in more diverse, real-world scenarios.
Future Work. (1) Improving the Capacity of the Vision Encoder: Our work follows LLaV A [ 10]
by employing a CLIP-based ViT as the vision encoder. However, some studies [ 83,84] have demon-
strated that stronger vision encoders can lead to more significant improvements, e.g., DINOv2 [ 85].(2)
Refining Keypoint Decoding Strategy: Inspired by previous MLLMs for perception tasks [ 78,73],
we introduce a special token <keypoint> into the model’s vocabulary. When the model generates
this<keypoint> token, its hidden embedding is decoded to the corresponding keypoint position.
Although this strategy has shown promising results, it remains sub-optimal for user interaction. A
more direct approach is to output the keypoint coordinates as textual descriptions. However, training
a model to express numerical values in text using cross-entropy loss is challenging because slight
deviations in numerical values can lead to significant differences in the generated text. Therefore,
it intuitively requires more data for effective training. (3) Expanding Data Scale and Category
Diversity: The datasets used in our experiments follow standard benchmarks. However, both the
MP-100 dataset [ 21] for visual prompt-based keypoint detection and the AP-10K dataset [ 32] for
textual prompt-based keypoint detection contain only a small amount of data, which limits the model’s
generalization performance. Furthermore, the limited diversity of object and keypoint categories
greatly reduces the model’s applicability, making it insufficient for handling open-world scenarios. A
promising direction is to leverage large-scale keypoint datasets for training, such as UniKPT [ 52],
which could further explore the upper bounds of MLLMs for keypoint comprehension.
Broader Impact. The study aims to enhance MLLMs for understanding images at a more granular
keypoint level. We also propose a new challenge of keypoint semantic understanding, which holds
promise for benefiting tasks such as structural understanding, action recognition, and medical image
analysis. Nevertheless, recognizing the potential negative impacts that are common to many MLLMs,
our model also carries risks, including the amplification of societal biases and concerns regarding
privacy and ethics. To address these issues, we are committed to implementing safeguards, including
strict access controls and the establishment of clear usage policies and agreements.

should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
16Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Implementation details can be found in Sec. 4.1.3.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
17Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our code will be released at https://kptllm.github.io .
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Training details can be found in Sec. 3.5, and experimental setups can be found
in Sec. 4.1.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
18•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Sec. 4.1.3.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have carefully reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. And the research
conform with it in every respect.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Sec. 6.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
19•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Sec. 6.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The assets are properly cited.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
20•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not introduce any new assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
