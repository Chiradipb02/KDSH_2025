Abstract
This paper studies the problem of rigid dynamics modeling, which has a wide
range of applications in robotics, graphics, and mechanical design. The problem
is partly solved by graph neural network (GNN) simulators. However, these
approaches cannot effectively handle the relationship between intrinsic continuity
and instantaneous changes in rigid dynamics. Moreover, they usually neglect
hierarchical structures across mesh nodes and objects in systems. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach named Event-attend Graph ODE (EGODE) for
effective rigid dynamics modeling. In particular, we describe the rigid system using
both mesh node representations and object representations. To model continuous
dynamics across hierarchical structures, we use a coupled graph ODE framework
for the evolution of both types of representations over a long period. In addition, to
capture instantaneous changes during the collision, we introduce an event module,
which can effectively estimate the occurrence of the collision and update the
states of both mesh node and object representations during evolution. Extensive
experiments on a range of benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the
proposed EGODE compared to various state-of-the-art baselines. The source code

1 Introduction
Physics simulations [ 50,59] can benefit researchers from many fields by guiding experiments and
testing their theories [58]. Among them, simulating rigid collisions has received extensive attention
with applications in robotics [ 19] and graphics [ 3]. However, high-quality physical simulations
usually require complicated computing, which requires extensive computational resources. To solve
this issue, data-driven approaches [ 1,47] that aim to leverage machine learning for efficient simulators
are becoming increasingly popular within the recent years.
In literature, a variety of existing approaches have been proposed to model physical systems [ 20,
52,47,2,1,29]. Early attempts usually focus on simulations on regular grids [ 57,43,42,40] and
use convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, in real-world scenarios, objects are rarely
located in regular ways [ 18,5,55,39]. To increase the applicability, many current works use irregular
mesh points [ 47,31,1] to describe objects in physical systems and utilize graph neural networks
(GNNs) [ 16,28,38] to capture the interactions between mesh points. In particular, they adopt

an encoder-processor-decoder architecture, which first maps observations of each mesh point at
the current time step into the latent space, and then follows the message-passing mechanism [ 28]
to update node representations iteratively. Finally, a decoder is utilized to generate the predicted
trajectories.
Despite their notable process, these approaches [ 20,52,47,2,1] suffer from three basic obstacles,
which could seriously degrade the forecasting performance. Firstly , the majority of existing ap-
proaches [ 2,47] utilize a rollout process to model dynamical systems, which take the predictions at
the next time as the input in an autoregressive process. The discrete rollout process makes it difficult
to capture the long-term tendency and continuous evolution of complex physical systems. Secondly ,
aside from the continuous evolution, rigid dynamics would face instantaneous changes [ 20,54]
caused by contact dynamics at certain time steps,whereas the existing approaches often fail to take
it into consideration. Therefore, we are required to build a model that can precisely capture the
relationships between the dominant continuous evolution and instantaneous changes in complicated
rigid-body systems. Thirdly , since each object is described by multiple mesh nodes, rigid-body
systems intrinsically consist of hierarchical structures across mesh nodes and objects, which increases
the difficulty of modeling rigid dynamics.
To address the aforementioned obstacles, in this paper, we propose a novel framework named Event-
attend Graph ODE (EGODE) for modeling rigid dynamics. The core idea of our EGODE is to
understand the continuous evolution and instantaneous changes in rigid-body systems. To model
the hierarchical structures, we introduce both mesh node representations and object representations.
To model the continuous dynamics, we adopt its neighbor mesh nodes and the related object to
drive the evolution of mesh node representations. Meanwhile, global object representations and the
summarized local information jointly determine the evolution of objects. To model the instantaneous
changes, we introduce an event module, which estimates the next time when the collision occurs,
and then updates both the mesh node representations and the object representations in an iterative
manner. Finally, we minimize the standard mean square error (MSE) at both node and object levels.
We conduct extensive experiments on a range of benchmark datasets. A comparison of our EGODE
with other baselines on the Physion dataset is depicted in Figure 1. The experimental results can
validate the superiority of the proposed EGODE over a wide range of competing baselines.
In summary, the contributions of the paper are three-fold: (1) We provide a new perspective of
modeling both continuous evolution and instantaneous changes to study rigid dynamics. To the best
of our knowledge, we make the first attempt using graph ODE to simulate rigid-body systems. (2)
Our EGODE not only utilizes a coupled graph ODE to jointly model the continuous evolution of
both mesh nodes’ representations and objects’ representations, but also introduces an event module
to estimate the collision times for instantaneous updating. (3) Comprehensive experiments including
2quantitative comparison and visualization on different benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority
of our proposed EGODE over a wide range of competing approaches.
2 Related Work
Data-driven Physical Simulation. To facilitate physical simulations in different areas, a wide
range of researchers leverage machine learning to build effective data-driven simulators [ 47,54,52].
Early attempts usually adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to model physical systems
with grid structures [ 46]. To increase the flexibility of simulators, recent efforts have focused on
building simulators on irregular grids [ 47,20,52], which usually leverage graph neural networks
(GNNs) [28] to model the interaction between objects. For example, MeshGraphNet [47] adopts an
encoder-processor-decoder architecture to predict the next states for effective mesh-based simulations.
EGNN [ 20] considers the subequivariance of physical systems during the message passing process.
GNS [ 52] have validated the potential of graph neural networks for modeling rigid dynamics.
However, these approaches cannot handle intrinsic continuity and discontinuity in rigid models while
our EGODE is the first work to introduce graph ODE for effective rigid dynamical modeling.
Graph Neural Networks. Graph neural networks (GNNs) [ 28,26,25] have been shown efficient
in a wide range of vision tasks including cross-modal learning [ 67,60], object detection [ 33,56]
and transfer learning [ 15,17,66,34,35]. These approaches usually follow the paradigm of mes-
sage passing [ 65], which updates the central nodes by aggregating their neighborhood information
iteratively. Through this process, GNNs can learn from geometric structures for downstream tasks.
By combining GNNs with neural ODEs [ 9], a range of continuous GNNs [ 48,64,49,61] have
been developed, which model the neighborhood aggregation in a continuous way. For example,
GDERec [ 49] combines neural ODE with an attention-based GNN to model the interaction signals
in recommender systems. However, these approaches usually neglect the instantaneous change in
interacting dynamical systems [ 9]. To handle this, we propose a new continuous GNN framework
named EGODE, which can model the instantaneous updating in rigid-body systems.
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). Compared with classic deep neural networks,
neural ODEs [ 9] aim to include continuous layers rather than discrete ones with extensive applica-
tions [ 44,7,63,4,21,8]. The updating rule of neural ODE is accelerated by incorporating adjoint
functions with neural ODE solvers [ 12]. Recently, a range of approaches [ 10,14,41] have been
proposed to improve the effectiveness of neural ODE, including augmenting the dimension [ 10]
and regularization terms [ 14,41]. Neural ODEs have been adopted to model multi-agent dynamical
systems [ 23,24,37,36], which can deal with irregularly sampled data and partial observations. In
this paper, we propose a novel neural ODE framework EGODE, which can model both instantaneous
updating and continuous evolution in rigid-body systems.
3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Definition
We assume that a rigid-body physical system consists of Mobjects with Nmesh points. The state
information of each mesh node i,1≤i≤N, includes the observation vectors (i.e., the position
vector xt
iand the velocity vector vt
iat time t) and static vectors si(e.g., friction of the floor) unrelated
to the geometric context. The graph structure is constructed based on positions of mesh nodes, i.e.,
Gt={V, Et}where Vcollects all the mesh points and Etconsists of all the edges at the time step
t. Following previous works [ 20], we build an edge when the distance between two mesh points is
below a given threshold, making up the edge set Et. Given the initial states G0, we aim to predict the
future trajectories X1:Twhere Xtdenotes the position matrix at the time step t.
3.2 Framework Overview
In this work, we study the problem of modeling rigid-body physical systems, which is challenging
due to the hierarchical evolution of systems and instantaneous changes from collisions. Towards this
end, we introduce a new framework named EGODE, which models the evolution of physical systems
in a continuous manner with the consideration of instantaneous events. In particular, EGODE first
drives the dynamics of mesh nodes using both its surrounding mesh nodes and the associated object.

instantaneous changes, such as those arising from collisions.
Moreover, the object-level dynamics is driven by local node information and global system states. To
effectively capture the instantaneous collision, we introduce a learnable event module, which detects
the potential collision time and updates the instantaneous change iteratively during ODE evolution.
An overview of the proposed EGODE can be found in Figure 2 and the details are introduced below.
3.3 Coupled Graph ODE
Previous works [ 20,52,47] usually adopt graph neural networks (GNNs) [ 16] to predict the states of
objects at the next step, followed by autoregressive iterations for long-term predictions. However,
these approaches cannot capture the long-term tendency and continuous evolution in physical sys-
tems [ 23]. Towards this time, we introduce a graph ODE framework, which can capture continuous
dynamics in interacting systems naturally. Moreover, since we have both objects and mesh nodes in
rigid-body systems, our ODE framework consists of a coupled architecture, which models hierarchical
structures in a unified way [24, 68, 20].
In particular, we first initialize each latent state using the static vector, and then concatenate all the
dynamical vectors with it for each node into a new vector rt
ias follows:
rt
i= [xt
i,vt
i,ht
i], (1)
where ht
idenotes the corresponding hidden state with h0
i=si. To model the continuous evolution,
we introduce a neural graph ODE framework by combining neural ODE [9] with GNNs. Our graph
ODE drives the dynamics of the system using the interaction between each node and its neighbors.
Formally, we have:
drt
i
dt=ϕl(X
j∈Nt(i)ψl(rt
i,rt
j)), (2)
where Nt(i)collects the neighbors of mesh node iat the time step t.ψl(·,·)aims to capture the
interaction between each object and its neighbors and ϕl(·)produces the summarized influence from
the neighborhood to drive the evolution of the system. Moreover, in rigid-body systems, there are
naturally hierarchical structures ranging between mesh nodes and objects. To model the hierarchy
effectively, we introduce the states at the object level, by calculating the average of their corresponding
observation vectors. In formulation, the object-level vectors can be initialized as follows:
˜x0
cj=1
|i:o(i) =j|X
i:o(i)=jx0
i, (3)
4˜v0
cj=1
|i:o(i) =j|X
i:o(i)=jv0
i, (4)
where o(i)returns the object jcorresponding to the mesh point i. We also utilize ˜ht
cjto denote the
latent object representation of each object and have ˜rt
cj= [˜xt
cj,˜vt
cj,˜ht
cj], which is then incorporated
into the evolution of all its corresponding nodes. In other words, we re-write Equation 2 into:
drt
i
dt=ϕl([X
i′∈Nt(i)ψl(rt
i,rt
i′),˜rt
cj]), (5)
where ˜rt
cjcan provide high-level semantics for dynamics modeling. To obtain ˜rt
cj, we include another
graph ODE to drive the evolution at the object level. Here, we not only connect each object with all
the other objects in the system for global understanding, but also learn from its corresponding mesh
node for local information. In formulation, we have:
d˜rt
cj
dt=ϕg([MX
j=1ψg(˜rt
cj,˜rt
cj′),1
|i:o(i) =j|X
i:o(i)=jrt
i]), (6)
where ϕg(·)andψg(·,·)are two learnable functions to object-level updating with different parameters,
Mis the number of objects. In the right hand, the first term calculates the interaction between different
objects and the second term summarizes the states of its associated node presentations. In the end,
we combine both Equation 5 and Equation 6 to jointly solve the coupled ODE, which can not only
model the continuous evolution in physical systems, but also output the trajectory at any time step.
The whole coupled ODE can be solved by traditional neural ODE solver [9].
3.4 Event Module for Collision Modeling
We have introduced a graph ODE framework to model the continuous evolution in physical systems.
However, rigid-body dynamical systems [ 20,1,2] could include instantaneous change during the
collision between objects. In this case, our coupled graph ODE could be incapable of sufficiently
modeling these discontinuous systems. To tackle this, we include a learnable event module to estimate
the time of potential collision, which can guide the adjustment to the states of different mesh points
and objects [8, 51, 47].
One basic solution to model the event (i.e., collision) occurrence is to utilize prior knowledge
(e.g., shapes of objects) as well as position information, which could be unavailable in real-world
applications. As a consequence, to make our data-driven model more generalized, we utilize a
learnable event function condition on the pairwise states of mesh points, which can be formalized
asg(t,[xt
i,vt
i,xt
i′,vt
i′]). This event function is capable of continuously detecting the time when the
collision between mesh nodes iandi′occurs using the following equation:
g(t,[xt
i,vt
i,xt
i′,vt
i′]) = 0 . (7)
Note that event fucntion is only calculated between point-pairs whose distance is within a threshold
to avoid square complexity. After solving Equation 7 using the neural ODE solver, we can obtain the
collision time t∗. Note that in rigid-body systems, the collisions of mesh nodes from different objects
would bring in instantaneous change on all the mesh nodes in their related objects. Here, we update
the states of observations using the current states and the object that it collides with. In formulation,
the vector after the collision can be written as:
rt∗+
i=ϕl∗([X
j∈Ct∗(i)ψl∗(rt∗
i,rt∗
j),˜rt∗
cj]). (8)
Here,Ct∗(i)collects all the mesh nodes belonging to the object that it collides with, and ϕl∗(·)and
ψl∗(·)are two new learnable functions for instantaneous updating. Through this, we involve an
immediate updating at the time step t∗fromrt∗
itort∗+
i, which can simulate the collision between
different objects. Similarly, we can update the state of each object as:
˜rt∗+
cj=ϕg∗([ψg∗(˜rt∗
cj,˜rt∗
cj′),1
|i:o(i) =j|X
i:o(i)=jrt∗
i]), (9)

term models the average of updated mesh node representations. Finally, the whole event-attended
graph ODE can be solved by iteratively calculating the next collision using graph ODE and updating
the corresponding state with Equation 8 and Equation 9. In this way, we integrate the instantaneous
updating into the ODE-based continuous evolution to model the rigid dynamics.

To optimize our graph ODE framework, we first output the observation at different time steps and
then minimize the standard mean square error (MSE) loss between the predicted trajectories ˆXtand
the ground truth Xt:
Ll=TX

4 Experiments
4.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets. Our proposed model EGODE is evaluated on two physical dynamics datasets, i.e., Rigid-
Fall [ 30] and Physion [ 6]. RigidFall simulates collisions and interactions between three rigid cubes
during falling under a varying gravitational acceleration. Physion, a large-scale dataset and bench-
mark for physical system interaction evaluation, models both rigid and soft-body collisions for 8
distinct scenarios, which are Dominoes, Contain, Collide, Drop, Roll, Link, Support, and Drape.
Each scenario consists of 2000 training trajectories and 150 testing simulations. The two datasets
both treat objects as assemblies of particles.
Baselines and metrics. We compare the performance of EGODE with a range of classical methods
and state-of-art methods including MLP, RNN, SocialODE [ 62], GNS [ 52], DPI-Net [ 30], EGNN [ 53],
GMN [ 22], SGNN [ 20], and SEGNO [ 32]. We utilize two evaluation metrics: i.e., Contact prediction
accuracy and Mean Square Error (MSE).
Implementation Details. We implement our baseline models using Pytorch [ 45] and torchdiffeq [ 27].
We adopt the same hyper-parameters and training strategy for both Physion and RigidFall datasets as

mentioned by SGNN [ 20]. In our method, we initialize all MLP layers with a hidden size of 200. An
Adam optimizer with the initial learning rate of 0.0001 is adopted during training. We also employ
an early stopping strategy of 10 epochs according to validation loss. The batch size is set to 1 for
Physion and 8 for RigidFall dataset. To ensure a fair comparison, we initialize all baseline models’
parameters based on corresponding papers and then fine-tune them to achieve the best results.
4.2 Performance Comparison
The comparison results for Physion and RigidFall datasets are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 ac-
cordingly. For the RigidFall dataset, we follow the comparison strategy of SGNN to assess the
model’s performance with different sizes of the training dataset. From the results, we have three
observations. Firstly , although the best baseline varies between the datasets, it is generally observed
that hierarchical models outperform particle-level models, which confirms that hierarchical methods
inherently capture the intrinsic attributes in rigid-body systems and reduce the difficulty of modeling
dynamics. Secondly , our EGODE demonstrates highest contact prediction accuracy over all baseline
models in Physion dataset. In particular, compared to the best baseline SGNN on Dominoes and
Collide scenario, our proposed EGODE achieved an increase in prediction accuracy of 5.9% and
4.5%, respectively. Thirdly , we observe our EGODE has more robust prediction results than baseline
models in long-period prediction on RigidFall dataset, with just a small-scale training set. We attribute
the remarkable performance of the proposed EGODE to three key reasons: (1) Introduction of neural
ODE in EGODE, provides superior generalization for dynamic systems, especially in long-term
prediction scenarios. The neural ODE allows for more accurate modeling for continuous systems,
thereby enhancing the overall performance of our model. (2) Introduction of a coupled architecture.

Our EGODE incorporates both objects and mesh nodes in the rigid body, enabling effective modeling
of the dynamic system. (3) Introduction of an event module for collision modeling helps EGODE
effectively tackle complex and diverse instantaneous events in rigid body motion, thereby enhancing
the performance across different scenarios.
4.3 Ablation Study
We analyze our EGODE and evaluate the model’s effectiveness in various aspects. In particular,
we introduce three model variants as follows: (1) EGODE w/o O , which removes neural ODE;
(2) EGODE w/o C , which removes coupled architecture; (3) EGODE w/o E , which removes event
module for collision modeling; The results are presented in Table 3. We observe that removing any
of the three components leads to an obvious drop in performance on most datasets and tasks. Notably,
EGODE w/o O causes the most performance degradation. This indicates the continuous method
is insufficient to capture the intricate information inherent in rigid body dynamics. We can also
conclude from the experiment results that the coupled architecture and event module are crucial for
accurately predicting rigid body systems, by effectively aggregating local information, broadcasting
global information, and modeling collision events.
4.4 Sensitivity Analysis
In this section, we investigate how the hyperparameters, i.e. λin Equation 12 and the distance
threshold dfor mesh graph construction. The results shown in Figure 4 indicate that the model
achieves optimal performance when λ= 1when other parameters are fixed. The experiments also
suggest that our EGODE exhibits overall stability and robustness across different λ. The impact of
distance threshold dis also analyzed. When dis relatively small, it reduces the connectivity between
mesh nodes within an object, hindering information propagation in the network. Conversely, when
dis relatively large, redundant interactions might be introduced between objects, slightly affecting
model performance. The optimal value of dis depending on the density of mesh nodes and the scale
of the objects. Ultimately, we set λ= 1andd= 0.08respectively in our experiments.

form of Newton’s second law. Consequently, by introducing a term representing external forces
in Equation 5, we can effectively simulate the presence of additional external forces during the
ODE integration process. The external force term in the above setting can be an arbitrary function
of position, velocity, and object attribute. Therefore, by defining this term as various force field
functions, EGODE can readily simulate the motion of rigid bodies under the influence of different
external forces. Detailed formulations about the external force can be found in the Appendix A.
In our experiment, we employ the most common form of resistive force, which is proportional to
velocity. We conducte experiments on the Collision scenario from the Physion dataset. As illustrated
in Figure 5, when the resistive force is incorporated into the ODE simulation, a notable change in
the motion dynamics is observed. In the ground truth, the blue cuboid possesses sufficient energy
to collide with and topple the static objects. However, with the introduction of resistive force,
the cuboid’s velocity and kinetic energy are significantly consumed. These experimental results
substantiate the efficacy of our ODE formulation in effectively modeling and transferring motion
under the influence of force fields. This remarkable generalization capability stems from the inherent
continuity and differentiability properties of our proposed EGODE.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we investigate the problem of rigid dynamics modeling and propose a new approach
named EGODE to solve the problem. Our EGODE uses both mesh node representations and object
representations to describe the rigid system. More importantly, it adopts a coupled graph ODE
architecture to capture the evolution of dynamical systems. To model the occurrence of collisions,
EGODE adopts an event module that provides instantaneous updating for the states of mesh node and
object representations. Extensive experiments of various benchmark datasets validate the superiority
9of EGODE in comparison to different state-of-the-art methods. In future works, we will extend our
EGODE to more real-world scenarios including fluid simulation and human trajectory forecasting.
Broader Impacts and Limitations. This study introduces an effective data-driven approach EGODE
for modeling rigid dynamics, offering a new perspective on collision event modeling in rigid dynamics.
One limitation of our work is that our EGODE is unable to accommodate rigid body hinges and
deformable objects. Future works will extend EGODE to these more generalization scenarios.

i, we can effectively simulate the presence of additional external forces
during the ODE integration process by introducing a slight modification to Equation 5:
drt
i
dt=ϕl([X
i′∈Nt(i)ψl(rt
i,rt
i′),˜rt
cj]) + [ 0,F(xt
i,vt
i,ht
i),0], (13)
where Fis an arbitrary function of position, velocity, and object properties, we can deduce from
Newton’s laws that Fcorresponds to an additional acceleration term compared to the dynamics
described by Equation 5. Consequently, by defining Fas various force field functions, EGODE can
easily simulate the motion of rigid bodies under the influence of different external forces.
In our experiments, we use the most common form of resistive force, i.e., F(xt
i,vt
i,ht
i) =−γvt
i
where γdenotes a constant resistive coefficient. Then the dynamics of rt
ican be formulated as
follows:
drt
i
dt=ϕl([X
i′∈Nt(i)ψl(rt
i,rt
i′),˜rt
cj]) + [ 0,−γvt
i,0] (14)
We can obtain the speed components from both ends of the equation at the same time, and then
simplify the formulation:
dvt
i
dt= [ϕl([X
i′∈Nt(i)ψl(rt
i,rt

This function about vt
iis similar to a classic decay differential equation. In particular, when there
are tiny interactions between nodes and no collisions between objects, the right hand of Equation 15
approaches to 0, and the solution can be approximated as:
vt
i≈Cie−γt(16)
where Ciis a constant decided by initial conditions. The expression demonstrates particles whose
velocity decays exponentially in space. Although the derivation above is based on various assumptions,
our experiments in Section 4.5 showed similar results.
B Details of Baselines
Our EGODE is compared with a range of competitive methods including MLP, RNN, GNS [ 52],
DPI-Net [ 30], EGNN [ 53], GMN [ 22], SGNN [ 20], SocialODE [ 62], and SEGNO [ 32]. The details
of each method are depicted as follows:
•MLP : A classical machine learning method applied to the Rigid-body collision task.
•RNN : A classical method for time-series prediction, used to model rigid-body movement
and predict subsequent motion steps.
•GNS [52]: A discrete method that models physical interactions via particle representa-
tion using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It consists of an encoder-processor-decoder
architecture
•DPI-Net [30]: A GNN-based method that learns dynamics via particle representation
with different materials, including fluids, gases, soft and rigid objects. It showcases the
generalization capability with a learned particle dynamics model in real-world control tasks.
15•EGNN [53]: A GNN-based method designed for dynamics modelling. The model subjects to
several equivariance constraints including rotation, translation, and permutation, complying
with physics rules.
•GMN [22]: A GNN-based method designed for learning dynamics. In addition to rotation,
translation, and permutation constraints, GMN also adds geometric constraints, making it
geometrically equivariant for interacting objects in the real world.
•SGNN [20]: A discrete method which relaxes the equivariant constraints (rota-
tion/translation/permutation) to subequivariance due to external fields like gravity. It consists
of both object-level and particle-level message-passing.
•SocialODE [62]: An encoder-decoder based architecture that adopts Neural ODE to model
continuous transition states. The encoder is a spatio-temporal transformer that encodes
historical information into a latent vector, and a sequence of latent trajectories is generated
through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver and recovered by the decoder.
•SEGNO [32]: A GNN-based continuous equivariant method using Neural ODE to approxi-
mate dynamic trajectories. It also incorporates second-order motion information to enhance
modeling capacity.
C Details of Datasets
We mainly conduct experiments on two datasets: Physion [ 6] and RigidFall [ 30]. Physion is a large-
scale dataset and benchmark for physical system interaction evaluation designed by ThreeDWorld [ 13].
It contains 8 realistically simulated scenarios:
•Dominoes : Simulation of dominoes being knocked down one after another.
•Contain : Simulation involving collisions with concave rigid bodies.
•Collide : Simulation of a rigid body crashing into other rigid bodies at a relatively high
speed.
•Drop : Simulation of a rigid body falling onto other rigid bodies.
•Roll: Simulation of a rigid body sliding and rolling.
•Link : Simulation of ring-mounted rigid bodies.
•Support : Simulation of a stack of rigid bodies being hit.
•Drape : Simulation of a lightweight flexible object falling on rigid bodies.
RigidFall simulates collisions and interactions between three rigid cubes where each cube consists
of 64 particles. The three cubes are initially placed in a stack in the air and fall under varying
gravitational acceleration.
D Details of Evaluation Metric
To compare these baseline models, we utilize two evaluation metrics: i.e., Contact prediction accuracy
and Mean Square Error (MSE). The Contact prediction metric is provided by Physion [ 6] and used
to evaluate whether two target objects collide or not in the whole trajectory. Notably, for MSE, we
compare the Euclidean coordinates difference directly rather than calculating the difference between
the normalized actual position and predictions. This approach enables a more precise quantification
of positional discrepancies in three-dimensional space.
• Contact prediction accuracy:
Acc=1
ssX
j=11(yj= ˆyj).
• Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
MAE =1
nnX
i=1|xi−ˆxi|.

predicted value.
E Additional Implementation Details
We use torch-geometric [ 11] and torchdiffeq [ 27] to complete our code. To enable a fair comparison
with previous baselines, our model is only given the initial states of the trajectory X0to predict
future trajectories X1:Tfor both Physion and RigidFall datasets. An Adam optimizer with the initial
learning rate of 0.0001, beta(0.9, 0.999) is adopted during training. A factor of 0.8 and patience of 3 is
adopted for the Plateau scheduler. We train our model for 1000 epochs and an early stopping strategy
of 10 epochs according to validation loss. To solve the ODE function, we adopt the common Euler
ODE solver in our experiment and it performs well in physics modeling task. By adding adaptive
collision event module, our model can easily detect collision in the evaluation stage and compute the
contact prediction accuracy. For baseline methods without event detector, we follow previous setting
of a predefined contact threshold to judge collision and compute corresponding contact accuracy
during evaluation. We conduct our experiments on a server with eight NVIDIA A40 GPUs. Since an
OpenGL interface and a monitor are required for the visualization process, we visualize our results
using a local PC with a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU.
F Additional Experiments
F.1 Prediction MSE on Physion.
We also investigate the prediction MSE in some scenes of the Physion dataset of our method and
compared methods. Note that in some scenes (Contain, Drop, Link, Support), objects are often
initially positioned in a centrally symmetric manner, therefore all motion patterns centrally symmetric
to the ground truth center are reasonable. In this case, MSE is unable to provide an accurate
representation of the predictive performance of the model. The results are demonstrated in Table 4.
We can indicate that our EGODE outperforms the two strong baselines in all scenes.

F.2 More Generalization Performance
To rigorously evaluate the generalization capability of the proposed EGODE in diverse scenarios,
we employ models trained on one specific scenario and test their performance on different scenarios
from the Physion dataset. The results illustrated in Fig 6 demonstrate that our proposed method
exhibits significantly stronger generalization performance compared to the best baseline, SGNN. This
observation highlights the model’s proficiency in learning and effectively transferring the underlying
principles governing object dynamics and interactions, transcending the specifics of the training
scenario. Such superior generalization capability is a testament to the model’s ability to capture the
intrinsic pattern of rigid dynamics, enabling accurate predictions across diverse scenarios without the
need for explicit retraining.

As shown in the figure, the additional visualizations of predictions on the Physion Dataset showcase
that EGODE outperforms the best baseline SGNN to generate accurate trajectories. EGODE yields
predictions closer to the ground truth compared to SGNN. In addition, note that the tip of the green
object overlaps with the yellow object in the prediction of SGNN, while our model is more consistent
with rigid physical laws. The visualization indicates that EGODE performs better in incorporating
physics-based constraints and producing more physically plausible and accurate predictions.
19NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract states that this paper proposes a novel approach called EGODE
for effective rigid dynamics modeling. Our claims are supported by both theoretical analysis
and experimental results.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The conclusion states that our EGODE is unable to accommodate rigid body
hinges and deformable objects, due to the deficiency of the dataset. These problems will be
further discussed in future works.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
20Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The main emphasis of this paper lies in empirically validating the novelty
and effectiveness of the proposed framework while leaving theoretical insights for future
research.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Section 4.1, “Experimental Settings” and Appendix, we provide detailed
explanations of the datasets used and implementation details for our experiments.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
21some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Abstract, we provide an anonymous link to the code.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Section 4.1, “Experimental Settings” and the appendix, we provide detailed
explanations of the datasets used and implementation details for our experiments.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We precisely defined and reported the error bars.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
22•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In the appendix, we provide detailed explanations of computer resources used
for our experiments.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research conducted in the paper complies with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics
in every respect.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The Conclusion states that this study introduces an effective data-driven
approach EGODE for modeling rigid dynamics, offering a new perspective on collision
event modeling in rigid dynamics. One limitation of our work is that our EGODE is unable to
accommodate rigid body hinges and deformable objects. Future works will extend EGODE
to these more generalization scenarios.
23Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We explicitly cited the sources of the relevant data and other materials used in
the paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
24•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The anonymous link provided in the appendix contains well-documented
related materials.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
25•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
