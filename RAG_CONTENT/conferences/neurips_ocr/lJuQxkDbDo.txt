Abstract
Existing graph learning-based cognitive diagnosis (CD) methods have made rel-
atively good results, but their student, exercise, and concept representations are
learned and exchanged in an implicit unified graph, which makes the interaction-
agnostic exercise and concept representations be learned poorly, failing to pro-
vide high robustness against noise in students’ interactions. Besides, lower-order
exercise latent representations obtained in shallow layers are not well explored
when learning the student representation. To tackle the issues, this paper sug-
gests a meta multigraph-assisted disentangled graph learning framework for CD
(DisenGCD), which learns three types of representations on three disentangled
graphs: student-exercise-concept interaction, exercise-concept relation, and con-
cept dependency graphs, respectively. Specifically, the latter two graphs are
first disentangled from the interaction graph. Then, the student representation
is learned from the interaction graph by a devised meta multigraph learning mod-
ule; multiple learnable propagation paths in this module enable current student
latent representation to access lower-order exercise latent representations, which
can lead to more effective nad robust student representations learned; the ex-
ercise and concept representations are learned on the relation and dependency
graphs by graph attention modules. Finally, a novel diagnostic function is de-
vised to handle three disentangled representations for prediction. Experiments
show better performance and robustness of DisenGCD than state-of-the-art CD
methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of the disentangled learning frame-
work and meta multigraph module. The source code is available at https:

1 Introduction
In the realm of intelligent education [ 43,27,47], cognitive diagnosis (CD) plays a crucial role in
estimating students’ mastery/proficiency on each knowledge concept [ 1], which mainly models the
exercising process of students by predicting students’ responses based on their response records/logs

and the exercise-concept relations. As shown in Figure 1, student Bob completed five exercises
{e1, e2, e3, e4, e5}and got corresponding responses, and his diagnosis result can be obtained through
CD based on his records and the plotted relations between exercises and concepts. With students’ diag-
nosis results, many intelligent education tasks can be benefited, such as exercise assembly [ 42], course
recommendation [ 34,45], student testing [ 18], and targeted training [ 2], and remedial instruction [ 11].
In recent years, many cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) have been suggested based on various
techniques, generally classified into two types. The first type of CDMs is based on the theory
of educational psychology, and the representatives include DINA [ 4], (IRT) [ 13], and MIRT [ 20].
Considering that the simple diagnostic functions of this type of models fail to model complex student
interactions, recently, artificial intelligence researchers have tried to employ neural networks (NNs) to
enhance and invent novel CDMs. Therefore, the second type of CDMs can be further divided into two
sub-types: focusing on inventing novel diagnostic functions and enhancing the input representations
of CDMs, respectively. The representatives of the first sub-type of CDMs include the well-known
NCD [ 25], KSCD [ 15], and so on [ 44,16,12,36,38]. For the second sub-type of CDMs, many NN
techniques are employed, including hierarchical attention NNs for ECD [ 48], long short-term memory
networks for DIRT [ 3], graph neural networks (GNNs) for RCD [ 7], SCD [ 28], and GraphCDM [ 21].
Among existing CDMs, GNN-based ones exhibit significantly better performance than others, which
is attributed to the rich information propagation and exchange brought by GNNs. These CDMs
generally learn the student, exercise, and concept representations implicitly or explicitly on a unified
graph [ 7,28], which makes three types of representations be exchanged and aggregated fully even
if they are distant regarding relations, thus generating better representations and providing better
performance. However, learning exercise and concept representations should be student-interaction-
agnostic [ 31], while the above CDMs’ learning for exercise and concept representations is easily
affected by students’ interactions, and the representations will be learned poorly especially when
there exists noise in students’ interactions. In short, existing GNN-based CDMs fail to provide high
robustness against student interaction noise. In addition, these CDMs do not explore the use of
lower-order exercise latent representations in shallow layers for learning the student representation
due to the intrinsic defect of their GNNs. The learned student representations could be more robust
and not sensitive to student interaction data change.
Therefore, we propose a meta multigraph-assisted disentangled graph learning framework for CD
(DisenGCD) to learn robust representations against interaction noise. The contributions include
(1) The disentangled graph learning framework DisenGCD learns three types of representations on
three disentangled graphs. Specifically, the student representation is learned on the student-exercise-
concept interaction graph; the exercise and concept representations are learned on two disentangled
graphs: the exercise-concept relation graph and the concept dependency graph. By doing so, the latter
two learned representations are interaction-agnostic and robust against student interaction noise.
(2) To make the best of lower-order exercise latent representations for learning the robust student
representation, a modified meta multigraph module containing multiple learnable propagation paths
is used, where propagation paths enable current student latent representation to access and use
lower-order exercise latent representations. The exercise and concept representations are learned
through common graph attention networks (GAT) on relation and dependency graphs, respectively.
Finally, a novel diagnostic function is devised to handle three learned representations for prediction.
(3) Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed DisenGCD to state-of-the-art (SOTA)
models regarding performance and robustness, and the effectiveness of the disentangled graph
learning framework and the devised meta multigraph module is validated.
22 Related Work
Related Work on Cognitive Diagnosis . The above has given the classification of CDMs, and we
will briefly introduce typical CDMs, especially GNN-based ones. As representatives in educational
psychology, IRT [ 13] (MIRT [ 20]) utilizes single (multiple) variable(s) to denote student’s ability
with logistic function for prediction. For NN-based representatives, NCD [ 25] and KSCD [ 15] fed
student, exercise, and concept vectors to an IRT-like NN as the diagnostic function for prediction;
NAS-GCD [44] is similar to NCD, but its diagnostic function is automatically obtained.
For GNN-based CDMs, their focus is on obtaining enhanced representations. For example, RCD [ 7]
learns the student representation along the relation of adjacent exercise nodes, learns the exercise
representation along the relation of adjacent student and concept nodes, and learns the concept repre-
sentation along the relation of adjacent exercise and concept nodes. Since each node’s information
can be propagated to any node, learning regarding three relations can be seen as learning on an
implicit unified graph; Similarly, SCD [ 28] takes the same aggregation manner along the first two
relations of RCD for learning student and exercise representations for contrastive learning to mitigate
long-tail problems. Despite the success of GNN-based CDMs, their learning manners of exercise and
concept representations are not robust against student interaction noise, because the representations
are learned together with student interactions in a unified graph, where the noise will prevent the
representations from being learned well.
Related Work on Meta Graph/Multigraph . As can be seen, existing GNN-based CDMs intuitively
adopt classical GNNs (GAT [ 24] or GCN[ 9]) to learn three types of representations. These CDMs
update the student representation by only using the exercise latent representation in the previous layer
yet not exploring the use of lower-order exercise latent representations.
Compared to traditional GNNs, meta graph-based GNNs can make the target type of nodes access
lower-order latent representations of their adjacent nodes. The meta graph is a directed acyclic graph
built for a GNN, each node stores each layer’s output (latent representations) of the GNN, and each
edge between two nodes could be one of multiple types of propagation paths. The representatives
include DiffMG [ 5] and GEMS [ 8]. The meta multigraph is the same as the meta graph, but its each
edge could hold more than one type of propagation path, where the representative is PMMM [ 10]. To
make the best of low-order exercise latent representations for learning effective and robust student
representations, this paper adopts the idea of meta multigraph and devises a modified meta multigraph
learning module for the updating of the student interaction graph.
Related Work on Disentangling Graph Representation Learning . Learning potential representa-
tions of disentangling in complex graphs to achieve model robustness and interpretability has been
a hot topic in recent years. Researchers have put forward many disentanglement approaches (e.g.,
DisenGCN [ 19], DisenHAN [ 32], DGCF [ 29], DCCF [ 35], DcRec [ 33], etc.) to address this chal-
lenge. For example, in DisenHAN [ 32], the authors utilized disentangled representation learning to
account for the influence of each factor in an item. They achieved this by mapping the representation
into different spatial dimensions and aggregating item information from various edge types within
the graph neural network to extract features from different aspects; DcRec [ 33] disentangles the
network into a user-item domain and a user-user social domain, generating two views through data
augmentation and ultimately obtaining a more robust representation via contrastive learning.
Despite many approaches suggested, they were primarily applied to bipartite graphs to learn different
representations from different perspectives, for learning more comprehensive representations. While
this paper aims to leverage disentanglement learning to mitigate the influence of the interaction
noise in the interaction graph, and thus we proposed a meta multigraph-assisted disentangled graph
cognitive diagnostic framework to learn three types of representations on three disentangled graphs.
By doing so, the influence of the noise on exercise and concept learning can be well alleviated.
3 Problem Formulation
For easy understanding, two tables are created to describe all notations utilized in this paper including
notations for disentangled graphs and notations for the meta multigraph, summarized in Table 4 and
Table 5. Due to the page limit, the two tables are included in Appendix A.1.
33.1 Disentangled Graph
This paper only employs the student-exercise-concept interaction graph GIfor students’ representation
learning, and disentangles two graphs from GIfor the remaining two types of representation learning,
which are the exercise-concept relation graph GR, and the concept dependency graph GD.
Student-Exercise-Concept Interaction Graph. With students’ response records R, exercise-
concept relation matrix, and concept dependency matrix, the interaction graph GIcan be represented
asGI={V,E}. The node set V=S∪E∪Cis the union of the student set S, exercise set
E, and concept set C, while the edge set E=Rse∪ Rec∪ Rcccontains three types of relations:
rseij∈Rserepresents the student si∈Sanswered exercise ej∈E,recjk∈Recdenotes the
exercise ejcontains concept ck∈C, and rcckm∈Rccdenotes concept ckrelies on concept cm.
Disentangled Relation Graph. To avoid the impact of students’ interactions Rseon exercise
representation learning, the exercise-concept relation graph GRis disentangled from GI, denoted as
GR=GI/{S,Rse}={E∪C,Rec∪ Rcc}.
Disentangled Dependency Graph. Similarly, a concept dependency graph GDis further disentangled
fromGIto learn the concept representation without the influence of interactions Rseand exercises’
relation Rec, which is represented by GD=GR/{E,Rec}={C,Rcc}.
3.2 Problem Statement
For the cognitive diagnosis task in an intelligent education online platform, there are usually three
sets of items: a set of Nstudents S={s1, s2, . . . , s N}, a set of Mexercises E={e1, e2, . . . , e M},
and a set of Kknowledge concepts (concept for short) C={c1, c2, . . . , c K}. Besides, there
commonly exists two matrices: exercise-concept relation matrix Q= (Qjk∈ {0,1})M×K(Q-
matrix) and concept dependency matrix D= (Qkm∈ {0,1})K×K, to show the relationship of
exercises to concepts and concepts to concepts, respectively. Qjk= 1 denotes the concept ckis
not included in the exercise ejandQjk= 0 otherwise; similarly, Dkm= 1 denotes concept ck
relies on concept cmandDkm= 0otherwise. All students’ exercising reponse logs are denoted by
R={(si, ej, rij)|si∈S, ej∈E, rij∈ {0,1}}, where rijrefers to the response/answer of student
sion exercise ej.rij= 1means the answer is correct and rij= 0otherwise.
The CD based on disentangled graphs is defined as follows: Given : students’ response logs Rand
three disentangled graphs: interaction graph GI, relation graph GR, and dependency graph GD;Goal :
revealing students’ proficiency on concepts by predicting students’ responses through NNs.
4 Method
For better understanding, Figure 2 presents the overall architecture of the proposed DisenGCD, where
three learning modules are used for learning three types of representations on three disentangled
graphs and the diagnostic function makes the final prediction based on the learned representations.
Specifically, these three learning modules are: (1) a meta multigraph-based student learning module,
(2) a GAT-based exercise learning module, and (3) a GAT-based concept learning module. In each
learning module, the corresponding graph’s embedding is randomly first initialized. Then, the
meta multigraph-based student learning module is employed to learn the student representation Si
based on interaction graph GI; the GAT-based exercise learning module is used to learn the exercise
representation Ejbased on relation graph GR; while the concept representation Ckis learned by
the GAT-based concept learning module on dependency graph GDor the naive embedding if GDis
unavailable. Finally, a devised novel diagnostic function receives three learned representations Si,
Ej, andCkto get the prediction ˆrijof student sion exercise ej.
Note that the first module employs a modified meta multigraph aggregator to learn student representa-
tions. Compared to traditional graph learning, the module contains multiple learnable propagation
paths, which enable the student latent representation to be learned currently to access and use lower-
order exercise latent representations, leading to a more effective and robust student representation.

composed of three learning modules: two GAT-based learning modules and a meta multigraph-based
learning module, where the latter’s details are shown in the green part.
4.1 The Meta Multigraph-based Student Learning Module
Based on interaction graph GI, this module is responsible for: learning the optimal meta multigraph
structure in GI, i.e., optimal multiple propagation paths, and updating student nodes’ representations
based on the learned meta multigraph structure to get the representation Si∈R1×d.
To start with, all nodes (including students, exercises, and concepts) need to be mapped into a
d-dimensional hidden space. The student embedding si∈R1×dfor student si, exercise embedding

4.1.1 The Meta Multigraph Aggregator
To learn more useful representations from the above initial embedding, we construct a meta multigraph
MG ={H,AP} to specify a set of propagation paths for all nodes’ aggregation in graph learning.
As shown in Figure 2, the meta multigraph is actually a directed acyclic graph containing Phyper-
nodes: H={H(1), . . . ,H(p), . . . ,H(P)}.H(p)={sp∈RN×d,ep∈RM×d,cp∈RK×d}is a set
of latent representations stored in p-th hyper-node for all students, exercises, and concepts, whose
i-th row sp

of student si, exercise ej, and concept ck, respectively. Especially when p=1,sp

Each edge APuv∈ AP between two hyper-nodes H(u)andH(v)contains multiple types ( |HR|) of
propagation paths, which can be denoted as APuv={(hra∈ HR , hrwei
a∈[0,1])|1≤a≤ |HR|}.
Herehraisa-th type of propagation path in candidate path set HR, andhrwei
arepresents the weight
ofhra. This paper adopts |HR|=7 types of propagation paths as the candidate paths for HR: 1) the
students to exercises path Ase, 2) the exercises to students path Aes, 3) the exercises to concepts path
Aek, 4) the concepts to exercises path Ake, 5) the concepts to concepts path Akk, 6) the identity path
I, 7) the zero path zero .
5Here, path Asemeans updating the exercise latent representation along the propagation path of
student nodes to exercise nodes, and other paths hold similar meanings. As a result, HR =
{Ase, Aes, Aek, Ake, Akk, I, zero }, and the edge set AP inMG can be denoted by AP =
{APuv|1≤u < v ≤P}, containing |HR| ∗[P∗(P−1)/2]propagation paths. With above
propagation paths, H(p)can be updated by
H(p)=X
{f(APup,H(u))|1≤u < p}, (2)
where f(·)is the aggregation function of GCN. f(APup,H(u))refers to that obtaining the latent
representations ( sp
i,ep
j,cp
k) in hyper-node H(p)based on all latent representations stored in previous
hyper-nodes (i.e., H(1)toH(p−1)). It can be seen that the updating process of H(p)replies on latent
representations in multiple hyper-nodes and multiple propagation paths, which compose the modified
meta multigraph aggregator together.
For better understanding, here is an example: when p=3,AP13={zero}andAP23={Aes, I}, the
updating of three latent representations s3
i,e3
j, andc3
kis denoted as
AP13:

j=e3
j(13) + e3
j(23),c3
k=c3
k(13) + c3
k(23). (3)
The first equation is to update three latent representations according to AP13, while the second is to
get the updating based on AP23. The final latent representations are obtained by summing up both
updated ones. Here Up(·)andMess (·)are common update and message-passing functions.
4.1.2 Routing Strategy
To find suitable propagation paths, threshold τ(u,v)is created for each pair of hyper-nodes (u, v):
τ(u,v)=λ·max( Softmax (APuv)) + (1 −λ)·min(Softmax (APuv)), λis predefined .(4)
Softmax (APuv))normalizes weights of each type of propagation path regarding their hrwei
avalues.
By doing so, the propagation paths of each pair of hyper-nodes will remain if their hrwei
avalues are
greater than the corresponding threshold. Thus the updating process of H(p)can be rewritten as
H(p)=X
{f(ˆAPup,H(u))||1≤u < p}
ˆAPup={(hra, hrwei
a)|hrwei
a≥τ(u,p),∀hra∈APup}. (5)
Finally, the learned student representation sPinHPare used for the diagnosis, i.e, sP
iis used as Si.
4.2 The GAT-based Exercise Learning Module and GAT-based Concept Learning Module
GAT-based Exercise Learning Module . This module is responsible for learning the exercise
representation Ej∈R1×don the relation graph GRvia a L-layer GAT network [ 24]. Firstly, the
embedding of exercises and concepts in GRis obtained in the manner same as Eq.(1) through two
learnable matrices WR
E∈RM×dandWR
C∈RK×d, i.e,eR
j=xE
j×WR
E,cR
k=xC

C.
Afterward, the GAT neural network is applied to aggregate neighbor information to learn the exercise
representation. The aggregation process of l-th layer ( 1≤l≤L) can be represented as
eR(l)
j =P
k∈NejαR(l)

The first equation is to aggregate the information of exercise ej’s neighbors Nejto get its l-th layer’s
latent representation eR(l)
j∈R1×d, while the second is to update the l-th layer’s concept latent
representation cR(l)

thek-th row of αR(l)
jcan be obtained by
αR(l)
j(k)= Softmax( Fec([eR(l−1)
j ,cR(l−1)
k])),∀k∈Nej. (7)
[·]is the concatenation and Fec(·)is a fully connected (FC) layer mapping 2∗dvectors to scalars.
The latent representation eR(0)

jandcR
k, and the L-th layer output eR(L)

asEj. By disentangling the interaction data, the learned exercise representation Ejwill be more
robust against interaction noise.
GAT-based Concept Learning Module . Similarly, this module obtains the concept representation
Ck∈R1×dby applying a L-layer GAT network to the dependency graph GD. After obtaining the
initial embedding cD
k=xC

Cby a learnable matrix WD
C∈RK×d, this module updates the l-th

kis equal to cD
k, and the L-th layer output cD(L)
kis used as Ck. If graph GDis unavailable,
this module will directly take the initial embedding cD
kasCk. By further disentangling, the learned
representation Ckmay be robust against noise in student interactions to some extent.
4.3 The Diagnosis Module
To effectively handle the obtained three types of representations, a novel diagnostic function is
proposed to predict the response ˆrijof student sigot on exercise ejas follows:
hsimi=σ(Fsimi(hsi·hej)),hsi=Fsi(Si+Ck),hej=Fej(Ej+Ck)
ˆrij= (X
Qk·hsimi)/X
Qk, (8)
where Fsi(·),Fej(·), and Fsimi(·)are three FC layers mapping a d-dimensional vector to another
one, and Qkis a binary vector in the k-th row of Q-matrix.
Herehsi∈R1×dcan be seen as the student’s mastery of each knowledge concept; while the obtaining
ofhej∈R1×daims to get the exercise difficulty of each concept; hsimi is to measure the similarity
between hsiandhejvia a dot-product followed by an FC layer and a Sigmoid function σ(·)[41],
where a higher similarity value in each bit represents a higher mastery on each concept, further
indicating a higher probability of answering the related exercises; the last equation follows the idea
of NCD to compute the overall mastery averaged over all concepts contained in exercise ej.
We can see that the proposed diagnostic function has as high interpretability as NCD, IRT, and MIRT.
Model Optimization. With the above modules, the proposed DisenGCD are trained by solving the
following bilevel optimization problem through Adam [39]:
min
αLval(Dval|ω∗(α),α),s.t.ω∗(α) = argminωLtrain(Dtrain|ω,α), (9)
where Lval(·)andLtrain(·)denote the loss on validation dataset Dvaland training dataset Dtrain .
ωdenotes all model parameters, and αdenotes the weights of learnable propagation paths APin
meta multigraph MG. The cross-entropy loss [40] is used for LvalandLtrain .

5.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets. To verify the DisenGCD’s effectiveness, we conducted experiments on two public datasets
ASSISTments [ 6] and SLP [ 14], and one private dataset Math, whose statistics are in Table 1. Note
that ASSISTments and Math [ 16] were used for most experiments to answer RQ1 toRQ3 , and SLP
was used to answer RQ4 .More details of these datasets are presented in Appendix A.2 .
Comparison CDMs and Metrics. To verify the effectiveness of DisenGCD, five SOTA CDMs
were compared, including traditional CDMs DINA and MIRT, NN-based CDMs NCD and ECD, and
GNN-based RCD. Here SCD is not compared due to the failed run of its provided source code Three
metrics were adopted to measure the performance of all CDMs [ 37], including area under the cure
(AUC) [23], accuracy (ACC) [22], and root mean square error (RMSE) [46].
Parameter Settings. For the DisenGCD model, its dimension dwas set to the number of concepts,
Pin the meta multigraph, the number of layers Lin GAT, and λwere set to 5, 2, and 0.8. For its
training, the learning rate and batch size were 1e-4 and 256. For comprehensive comparisons [ 17],
four splitting ratios (40%/10%/50%, 50%/10%/40%, 60%/10%/30%, and 70%/10%/20%) were
adopted to get training, validation, and testing datasets. All compared CDMs followed the settings in
their original papers, and all experiments were executed on an NVIDIA RTX4090 GPU.
5.2 Overall Performance Comparison (RQ1)
To address RQ1 , the DisenGCD was compared with DINA, MIRT, NCD, ECD, and RCD on
ASSISTments and Math datasets. Table 2 summarizes their performance in terms of AUC, ACC, and
RMSE obtained under four dataset-splitting settings, where the best result of each column on one
dataset was highlighted in bold. Besides, Table 6 in the Appendix compares DisenGCD with three
SOTA CDMs, including SCD [28], KSCD [15], and KaNCD [26].
We can observe from the results in both tables that, DisenGCD holds better performance than all
compared CDMs. Besides, we can also obtain two observations from Table 2: Firstly, GNN-based
CDMs (RCD and DisenGCD) hold significantly better than NN-based CDMs (NCD and ECD),
indicating the importance of learning representations through graphs, and DisenGCD outperforming
RCD validates the superiority of DisenGCD’s graph learning manner. Secondly, as the ratio changes,

the performance change of DisenGCD and RCD is much smaller than NCD and ECD, which signifies
DisenGCD and RCD are more robust to different-sparsity data. To validate its sparsity superiority,
more experiments are summarized in Appendix B.1 .
5.3 Effectiveness of Disentangled Learning Framework of DisenGCD (RQ2)
To investigate DisenGCD’s robustness against interaction noise, we conducted robust experiments
on the ASSISTments dataset under the ratio of 60%/10%/30%, where a certain amount of noise
interactions were added to each student in the training and validation datasets. Figure 3a presents
the ACC and AUC of DisenGCD and RCD under noise data of different percentages. As the noise
data increases, the performance leading of DisenGCD over RCD becomes more significant, which
reaches maximal when noise data of 50% was added. That demonstrates DisenGCD is more robust to
student noise interactions than RCD, attributed to the disentangled learning framework of DisenGCD.
Similar observations can be drawn from more experiments on other two datasets in Appendix B.2 .
To further analyze the framework effectiveness, four variants of DisenGCD were created: Disen-
GCD(I) refers to learning three representations only on the interaction graph GI;DisenGCD(Is+Rec)
refers to learning student representation on GI, but learning exercise and concept ones on the relation
graphGR;DisenGCD(Ise+Rc) refers to learning student and exercise representations on GIbut
learning concept one on GR; while DisenGCD(Isc+Re) learns student and concept representations on
GIbut learns exercise one on GR. Table 3 compares the performance of RCD, DisenGCD, and its four
variants on ASSISTments. As can be seen, the comparison between DisenGCD(I) and other variants
indicates learning three representations in two disentangled graphs is more effective than in one
unified graph, especially with textitDisenGCD(Is+Rec); the comparison between DisenGCD(Is+Rec)
and DisenGCD indicates learning three representations in three disentangled graphs is more effective,
further validating the above conclusion. Finally, we can conclude that the proposed disentangled
learning framework is effective in enhancing DisenGCD’s performance and robustness.
5.4 Effectiveness of Meta Multigraph Learning Module in DisenGCD (RQ3)
In Table 3, both DisenGCD(I) and RCD learn three types of representations in one unified graph,
butDisenGCD(I) utilizes the meta multigraph aggregator. Therefore, the comparison between
DisenGCD(I) and RCD proves the devised meta multigraph learning module is effective in improving
the model performance to some extent.
To further validate this, we created three variants of DisenGCD: DisenGCD(naive) refers to the
meta multigraph module replaced by the naive embedding (i.e., Siequal to siin Eq.(1)); Dis-

enGCD(mp) refers to predefining the meta multigraph module’s propagation paths according to
HAN [ 30];DisenGCD(mg) refers to this module’s meta multigraph replaced by meta graph. Fig-
ure 3b presents the AUC and ACC values of DisenGDCN and its variants on two datasets under
the ratio of 60%/10%/30%. As can be seen, the devised meta multigraph learning module enables
DisenGDCN to hold significantly better performance than the naive embedding-based variant. The
comparison results between DisenGCD and DisenGCD(mg) as well as DisenGCD(mp) validates the
effectiveness of using meta multigraph and the automatically learned propagation paths (i.e., learned
meta multigraph). Thus, the effectiveness of the devised meta multigraph module can be validated.
5.5 Visualization and Effectiveness of Learned Meta Multigraph (RQ4)
The comparison between DisenGCD(mp) and DisenGCD has revealed the effectiveness of the learned
meta multigraph on the target dataset. Therefore, an intuitive doubt naturally emerged: Is the learned
meta multigraph still effective on other datasets? Before solving this, Figure 4a gives the structure
visualization of two learned meta multigraphs. We can see two learned meta multigraphs hold two
distinct structures. That may be because two datasets are a bit different regarding the relations
between exercises and concepts, where exercises in Math contain only one concept while exercises in
ASSISTments may contain more than one concept. Thus, another doubt naturally emerged: Is the
learned meta multigraph on the target dataset ineffective on a different type of dataset?
To solve the doubts, we applied six learned meta multigraphs (A1, A2, A3, M1, M2, and M3) to
the SLP. A1-A3 and M1-M3 were learned by DisenGCD three times on ASSISTments and Math.
SLP dataset is similar to Math, whose exercises only contain one concept. Figure 4b summarizes
the results of RCD and six DisenGCD variants that utilize six given meta multigraphs. As can be
seen, DisenGCD’s performance under M1-M3 is promising and better than RCD, while DisenGCD
under A1-A3 performed poorly. The observation can answer the above doubts to some extent: meta
multigraphs learned by DisenGCD may be effective when the datasets to be applied are similar to
target datasets.
In addition to the above four experiments, more experiments were executed to validate the devised
diagnostic functions, analyze the DisenGCD’s parameter sensitivity, analyze its execution efficiency,
and investigate the effectiveness of the employed GAT modules in Appendix B.3 ,Appendix B.4 ,
Appendix B.5 , and Appendix B.6 .
6 Conclusion
This paper proposed a meta multigraph-assisted disentangled graph learning framework for CD, called
DisenGCD. The proposed DisenGCD learned student, exercise, and concept representations on three
disentangled graphs, respectively. It devised a meta multigraph module to learn student representation
and employed two common GAT modules to learn exercise and concept representations. Compared
to SOTA CDMs on three datasets, the proposed DisenGCD exhibited highly better performance and
showed high robustness against interaction noise.

A.2 Statistics of Datasets
We evaluated our method on three real-world datasets: ASSISTments, Math and SLP, which both
provide student-exercise interaction records and the exercise-knowledge concept relational matrix.
•ASSISTments is a public dataset collected by the assistant online tutoring systems in the
2009-2010 acadaemic year.
•Math is a private dataset collected by a well-known online learning platform that contains
math practice records and test records for elementary and middle school students.
•SLP is another publicdata set that collects data on learners’ performance in eight different
subjects over three years of study, including maths, English, physics, chemistry, biology,
history and geography.
Notably, in both the Math dataset and the SLP dataset, they provide relationships between concepts.
For these three datasets, we filtered students with fewer than 15 answer records to ensure there was
enough data for the learning of the model. We compared our model with five previous diagnostic
models, including two classic models based on educational psychology, DINA [ 4] and MIRT [ 20],
two neural network-based models, NCD [ 25] and ECD [ 48], and a graph-based diagnostic model,
RCD [7].
•DINA [4] is a classical CDM, which uses a binary variable to characterize whether and
whether a student has mastered a specific concept.
•MIRT [20] is an extension of the irt model, which uses multidimensional vectors to
characterize students’ abilities and the difficulty of exercises, and uses linear functions to
model the interactions.
•NCD [25] is one of the recent CDMs based on deep learning, which uses neural networks
to model higher-order student-exercise complex interactions.
•ECD [48] incorporates the impact of the educational environment in students’ historical
answer records into the diagnostic model to achieve diagnostic enhancement. Here due to
the lack of educational background, we use random initialization vectors to characterize
cognitive states.
•RCD [7] is one of the most advanced models, which introduces the relationship between
concepts into cognitive diagnosis and models the relationship through a graph structure.
Appendix B Additional Experiments
B.1 Experiments on Dataset with Different Levels of Sparsity
As shown in Section 5.2, the proposed DisenGCD shows better performance than RCD even when
the splitting ratios change, which indicates the better robustness of DisenGCD to different-sparsity
data.
To further verify whether the proposed DisenGCD is robust against sparse data (i.e., missing data or

datasets under the splitting setting of 60%/ 10% / 30%. In the experiments, for each dataset, we
randomly deleted 5%, 10%, and 20% of the students’ answer records (i.e., the interaction data) in
the training sets, respectively, thus providing three variant training sets; the proposed DisenGCD

was compared with NCD and RCD, and their overall performance comparisons were summarized in
Table B.1.
As can be seen, under which deleting ratio, the proposed DisenGCD exhibits the best performance,
and its performance does not drop very significantly when the deleting ratio increases. Even when
deleting 20% of students’ interaction data, DisenGCD still achieves an AUC value of 0.7812, which
is greatly higher than NCD and RCD. It demonstrates that the proposed DisenGCD is effective on
sparse interaction data, which is mainly attributed to the devised meta-multigraph learning module.
That module enables the DisenGCD to access and use lower-order exercise latent representations,
thus providing more accurate and robust students’ representations, especially when partial data is
lacking.
In summary, the proposed DisenGCD is effective and more robust against sparse interaction data,
which benefits from the devised meta-multigraph learning module, and thus the effectiveness of the
meta-multigtaph learning module can be indirectly demonstrated.
B.2 More Experiments for Robustness Validation
In Section 5.3, we have validated the robustness of the proposed DisenGCD against interaction
noise on the ASSISTments dataset. To further show its robustness superiority, we executed the same
experiments on other two datasets, i.e., Math and SLP, under the same settings, where a certain ratio
of noise interactions were added to each student in the training and validation datasets. Figure 5

presents the results of DisenGCD and RCD obtained under different proportions of noise: the orange
polyline denotes DsienGCD’s results and the blue polyline denotes RCD’s results.
As can be seen, the proposed DisenGCD always performs better than RCD in both datasets under
different noise ratios. Besides, as the noise ratio increases, the performance leading of the proposed
DisenGCD to RCD becomes more significant. That further demonstrates the proposed DisenGCD
is more robust against student interaction noise and thus validates the effectiveness of the proposed
disentangled graph learning framework.
B.3 Validation of the Devised Diagnostic Function
In this paper, in addition to the disentangled learning framework and the devised meta multigraph
module, we also designed a novel diagnostic function to adopt them. To validate its effectiveness, we
compared it with the diagnostic functions of MIRT, NCD, and RCD on the Math dataset, where four
splitting settings were considered. Table 8 summarizes their overall performance regarding AUC,
ACC, and RMSE.
We can get the following two observations. Firstly, the comparisons of MIRT and DisenGCD-MIRT,
NCD and DisenGCD-NCD, as well as RCD and DisenGCD-RCD show that the representations
learned by the proposed DisenGCD are effective. Secondly, the performance superiority of DisenGCD
to other variants indicates the devised diagnostic function is effective. To sum up, the effectiveness of
the devised diagnostic function is validated.
B.4 Hyperarameter Sensitivity Analysis
For the proposed DisenGCD, there is an important hyperparameter, i.e., the number of hyper-nodes
in the meta multigraph. To investigate its influence on theDisenGCD, the hyper-node number was
set to 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively, and we executed the experiments on the ASSISTments and SLP
datasets. Figures 6 and 7 plot the results regarding AUC and RMSE.
As can be seen in both two datasets, the DisenGCD can achieve optimal results in terms of RMSE
and AUC, when the number of hyper-nodes is set to 5. When the number of hyper-nodes is less
than 5, the meta multigraph contains too few propagation paths, adversely affecting the learning of
student representations. This results in suboptimal performance compared to the scenario where the
number of hyper-nodes is 5. Conversely, when the number of hyper-nodes is greater than 5, there is
an abundance of propagation paths, making the aggregated information overly complex and hindering
effective student representation learning. Besides, more hyper-nodes cause more computational
complexity. Therefore, this paper set the number of hyper-nodes to 5 for the proposed disenGCD.
Furthermore, we aim to explore the influence of the number of hyper-nodes on the robustness of the
proposed DisenGCD. Therefore, we also executed the experiments on Math datasets under different
ratios of noise interaction(1%,30%,50%). Figures 8 plot the results regarding AUC and ACC. As
can be seen, when the number of hyper nodes is equal to 5, the robustness of DisenGCD is the most
promising, whose performance under different ratios of noises is balanced better than RCD.

B.5 Efficiency Analysis of DisenGCD
To investigate the computational efficiency of the proposed approach, we have compared it with
RCD on ASSISTments and Math datasets in terms of model inference time and training time.
Table 9 presents the overall comparison, where the time of the proposed DisenGCD under different
hyperparameters P is also reported.
As can be seen, DisenGCD’s inference time is better than RCD’s. This indicates that the proposed
DisenGCD is more efficient than RCD, further signifying that it is promising to extend DisenGCD to

more time to train the model, the proposed DisenGCD achieves the best performance on both two
datasets when P=5 and its runtime does not increase too much, which is much better than RCD.

20B.6 Ablation Experiments on Graph Representation Learning
To verify the superiority of the employed GAT on the proposed DisenGCD, three GNNs (GCN,
GraphSage, and HAN) are used to replace the GAT in the proposed DisenGCD, which are termed
DisenGCD(GCN), DisenGCD(GraphSage), and DisenGCD(HAN), respectively. Then, we compared
the three approaches with the proposed DisenGCD on the Math dataset. The comparison of them
is presented in Table 10 As shown in Table 10, the GCN-based DisenGCD achieves the worst
performance, followed by DisenGCD(HAN). The GraphSage-based DisenGCD holds a competitive
performance to yet is still worse than the proposed DisenGCD (based on GAT).
The above results show the GAT is a suitable and optimal choice among these four GNNs for the
proposed DisenGCD, but we think the GAT may not be the best choice because there exist other
types of GNNs that can be integrated with DisenGCD, showing better performance.
In summary, it is reasonable and effective for the proposed DisenGCD to adopt the GAT to learn the
representations.
Appendix C Limitation Discussion
There are still some limitations in the proposed DisenGCD.
•High Computational Complexity and Poor Scalability. The complexity of DisenGCD
consists of three parts: the aggregation of P-hypernode meta multigraph on N+M+K-
node interaction graph (average A1neighbors), L-layer GAT aggregation on the M+K-
node relation graph (average A2neighbors), and L-layer GAT aggregation on the K-node
dependency graph (average A3neighbors). Suppose each node is ddimensional, L-layer
GAT on K-node graph contains: computing nodes’ attention from neighbors O(L×K×
A3×d)and nodes’ linear transformation O(L×K×d2), totally equalling O(L×K×d×
(A3+d)); meta multigraph on N+M+K-node graph contains: computing nodes’ attention
O(P×(N+M+K)×A1×d), computing path’s attention O(P×(N+M+K)×d), and
nodes’ linear transformation O(P×(N+M+K)×d2). As a result, DisenGCD’s complexity
equals O(P(N+M+K)d(A1+1+d))+O(L(M+K)×d(A2+d))+O(L×K×d(A3+d)).
As analyzed above, the time complexity of our model may be high and not applicable in
some large data sets.
•Potentially Poor Task Transferability. The proposed method primarily targets cognitive
diagnosis tasks and is designed to handle such graphs as the student-exercise-concept graph,
which may not be readily applicable to other tasks. It is specifically tailored for modeling
tasks similar to the student-exercise-concept triad diagram.
21NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: [TODO] In the abstract and introduction section, we describe the motivation of
our research and the problems to be optimized
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: [TODO] In the appendix, we discuss some of the shortcomings of our model
and the directions for further optimization.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
22Answer: [NA]
Justification: [TODO] not applicable
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: [TODO] In the experimental chapter and the appendix chapter, we introduce
the experimental environment and details in detail.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
23Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: [TODO] We will include the required data set in the code that supplements the
file
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: [TODO] In the experimental chapter and the appendix chapter, we introduce
the experimental environment and details in detail
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: [TODO] We did not analyze the error in the experimental results
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
24•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: [TODO] We describe our experimental environment in detail in the experimen-
tal chapter
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: [TODO] Our experiment conforms to the experimental requirements of NIPS
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: [TODO] Our experiments help the development of AI in the field of education
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
25•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [TODO] not applicable
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: [TODO] The dataset we use is free from the interference of related issues we
introduce it in the experimental section
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
26•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [TODO] not applicable
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [TODO] not applicable
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
27•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
