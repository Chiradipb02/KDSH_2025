Abstract
This paper studies consensus conditions for leaderless and leader-follower matrix- 1
weighted consensus networks under the presence of constant time-delays. Several 2
delayed consensus algorithms for networks of single- and double-integrators using 3
only the relative positions are considered. Conditions for the networks to asymp- 4
totically converge to a consensus or clustering configuration are derived based on 5
direct eigenvalue evaluation or the Lyapunov-Krasovkii theorem. Furthermore, 6
an application of these algorithms in bearing-based network localization is also 7
considered. The theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations. 8
1 Introduction 9
Recently, matrix-weighted consensus, a multi-dimensional extension of the well-known scalar- 10
weighted consensus algorithm [20], has received a considerable amount of research attention. A 11
matrix-weighted consensus system models diffusion dynamics in a multi-layer system with intra- 12
and cross-layer interactions between multiple subsystems (or agents). Several applications of matrix- 13
weighted consensus systems include multi-dimensional opinion dynamics models in [1, 33], bearing- 14
based formation control [7,37], distributed localization of wireless sensor networks [3,4], and network 15
synchronization [31]. 16
A matrix-weighted consensus network can be described by a graph with both positive definite and 17
positive semidefinite matrix weights. Associated with the graph, a corresponding Laplacian matrix, 18
whose the kernel (aka the nullspace) may contain further subspaces in addition to the consensus 19
space [2,12,31], can be defined. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a matrix-weighted consensus 20
network to asymptotically achieve consensus or clustering were given in [29, 30]. Discrete-time and 21
randomized matrix-weighted consensus were studied in [14, 16, 28]. The authors in [22] investigated 22
the continuous-time consensus protocol with switching matrix-weighted graphs. A consensus is 23
asymptotically achieved if the weighted integral network over some fixed time period always contains 24
a positive spanning tree, or equivalently, the kernel of the Laplacian matrix of the integrated network 25
contains only the consensus space [22]. The works [15, 16] examined the consensus problems 26
over matrix-weighted networks for double-integrator agents. Controllability of the matrix-weighted 27
consensus network was discussed in [21]. Recent studies on bipartite and multi-partite matrix- 28
weighted consensus have been proposed in [10, 17, 32]. 29
It practice, time delays are unavoidable if agents communicate their state variables via a wireless 30
network, especially when the agents are separated by significant distances. When restricted to linear 31
systems, time delay yields phase lags and alters both the transient and steady-state responses of 32
the system. If the magnitude of the time delay is sufficiently large, the whole system could be 33
destabilized. For this reason, it is essential to examine the stability conditions of matrix-weighted 34
consensus networks under different assumptions on the time delays. It is noteworthy that even 35
with delayed linear differential equations, the exact analysis via characteristic equations will lead to 36
Submitted to 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024). Do not distribute.transcendental equations, of which solutions are often complicated [5, 23]. An alternative approach 37
for analysing the stability of time-delayed systems is based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii or Lyapunov- 38
Razumikhin theorems [11, 13]. In the literature, a sufficient condition for reaching a consensus in 39
a scalar consensus network with a uniform time delay was given in [20]. Lyapunov-Razumikhin 40
type functional was used for finding sufficient conditions for consensus networks with heterogeneous 41
edge delays and switching interaction topology in [27]. The authors in [25] studied the consensus 42
problem with uniform delay communication and provided consensus conditions by considering 43
some Lyapunov–Razumikhin functionals. The author in [24] considered a consensus problem with 44
heterogeneous communication time delays and introduced a delayed weighted Laplacian for the 45
analysis. The consensus of double-integrator agents with time delay was studied in [34] based on 46
an approximated characteristic equation under the assumption that the delays are sufficiently small. 47
An exact analytic method for a second-order delayed scalar-consensus protocol was proposed in [6]. 48
Stabilization control laws for double- and chain of integrators using delays were proposed in [19], 49
and in the consensus problem over a scalar-weighted graph [26]. 50
In this paper, we derive stability conditions of several delayed matrix-weighted consensus models 51
having either a leaderless or a leader-follower topology. A leader-follower network contains several 52
leader agents acting as stationary references during the dynamic process. First, we consider a 53
matrix-weighted consensus network where all the edges have the same constant time delay. For this 54
network, a necessary and sufficient stability condition related to the magnitude of the time delay 55
and the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix-weighted Laplacian is established. Second, we study the 56
matrix-weighted consensus with multiple heterogeneous constant time delays. A stability condition 57
is given in terms of the feasibility of a linear matrix inequality (LMI). Third, we consider a matrix- 58
weighted consensus network of double integrators, and show that the network can asymptotically 59
reach the kernel of the matrix-weighted Laplacian by using only the delayed relative positions. As 60
it is assumed that the kernel of the matrix-weighted Laplacian is not restricted to the consensus 61
space, the applicability of the considered models is beyond a consensus problem. In particular, an 62
application of the theoretical results in bearing-based network localization [36] is also discussed. 63
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the theoretical background is provided 64
and three delayed matrix-weighted consensus models studied in this paper are presented. Sections 65
3–5 give stability conditions and detailed analysis of each consensus model. An application in 66
bearing-based network localization is discussed in Section 6, and simulation results are provided in 67
Appendix A.5 to support the analysis. Lastly, Section 7 concludes the paper. 68

2 Preliminaries 76
2.1 Matrix-weighted networks 77
Consider an undirected, matrix-weighted graph G= (V,E,A)with the vertex set V={1, . . . , n }, 78
the edge set E ⊆ V × V ofm=|E|edges, and the set of nonnegative definite matrix weights 79
A={Aij∈Rd×d}i,j∈VwithAij=A⊤
ij≥0,∀i, jandd≥2. Each edge (i, j)∈ Ecaptures the 80
interactions between two agents iandj, and the existence of (i, j)implies the existence of (j, i) 81
since the graph is undirected. If (i, j)∈ E, thenAij̸= 0; and if (i, j)/∈ Eori=j, thenAij=Θd. 82
The neighbor set of a vertex i∈ V is denoted as Ni={j∈ V| (i, j)∈ E} . Then, the degree matrix 83
of a vertex iis defined as Di=P
j∈NiAij. 84
Now, we can define matrix-weighted- adjacency and degree matrices A= [Aij]∈Rdn×dnand 85
D=blkdiag (D1, . . . ,Dn)∈Rdn×dn. A matrix weighted Laplacian L= [Lij]∈Rdn×dnhas 86

block entries 87
Lij=(
−Aij, ifi̸=j,Pn
j=1Aij,ifi=j.(1)
Note that Lis symmetric, positive semi-definite, and ker(L)⊇im(1n⊗Id). A matrix-weighted 88
graph and its corresponding matrix-weighted Laplacian is depicted in Fig. 1 as an example. 89
We order the edges in Esuch that E={e1, . . . , e m}, and adopt the notation Aij≡Ak,∀ek= 90
(i, j, k = 1, . . . , m ). For each edge (i, j), we specify a vertex to be the starting vertex and the other 91
vertex as the end vertex. The incidence matrix H= [hki]∈Rm×nis defined as follows 92
hki=

−1,ifiis the starting vertex of ek,
+1,ifiis the end vertex of ek,
0,otherwise.(2)
Then, L=¯H⊤blkdiag (Ak)¯H, where ¯H=H⊗Id, and ‘⊗’ denotes the Kronecker product. 93
Suppose that the matrix-weighted Laplacian Lhasl≥deigenvalues 0 with llinearly independent 94
eigenvectors v1, . . . ,vl. This assumption allows the possibilities of achieving a consensus or and 95
clustering when the following consensus algorithm is performed on a matrix-weighted network of 96
single integrators 97
˙xi(t) =X
j∈NiAij(xj(t)−xi(t)), i= 1, . . . , n. (3)
where xi∈Rdis the state vector of agent i∈ V. Let x= [x⊤
1, . . . ,x⊤
n]⊤∈Rdn, the matrix- 98
weighted consensus algorithm (3) can be rewritten in matrix form as 99
˙x(t) =−Lx(t), (4)
and it has been shown that x(t)→¯x=1
nPn
i=1xi(0)∈ker(L), ast→+∞[18, 29]. Throughout 100
the paper, the shorthand xij(t) =xj(t)−xi(t)will be used. 101
From the assumption that zero is a semi-simple eigenvalue of multiplicity l≥d, andLis symmetric, 102
positive semi-definite, there exists an orthonormal matrix P= [p1, . . . ,pdn] = [R,Q]∈Rdn×dn103
such that R= [p1, . . . ,pl]∈Rdn×l,Q= [pl+1, . . . ,pdn]∈Rdn×(dn−l), 104

R⊇im(1n⊗Id)since the kernel of a matrix-weighted Laplacian always contains the consensus 108
space. Also, Q⊤R=0(dn−l)×l,Q⊤Q=Idn−l. 109
Consider a partition of the vertex set into two disjoint subsets VaandVbsuch that Va∪ Vb=V, 110
Va∩ Vb=∅,|Va|=na,|Vb|=nb,na+nb=n. The agents associated with the vertices in 111
3VaandVbare referred to as leaders and followers, respectively. By labeling the vertices such that 112
Va={1, . . . , n a},Vb={na+ 1, . . . , n }, the matrix-weighted Laplacian is partitioned as 113

where La=L⊤

matrix-weighted Laplacian corresponding to the subgraph induced by the vertices in Vband edges in 115
G. Ifna= 0, we have a leaderless network while for na≥1, we have a leader-follower network. We 116
prove the following lemma on the matrix-weighted Laplacian (5). 117
Lemma 2.1. Let rank (L) =dn−l, rank (L′) =dnb−l,na≥1andl≥d+ 1. If∀ξ∈ker(L′), 118
[0⊤
dna,ξ⊤]⊤/∈ker(L), then the matrix Lbis symmetric positive definite. 119
Proof. LetB=blkdiag (Lab(1na⊗Id)) = blkdiag (B1, . . . ,Bnb)∈Rdnb×dnb, we have Lb= 120
L′−B. Suppose that Lbis not positive definite, then there exists ξ= [ξ⊤
1, . . . ,ξ⊤
nb]⊤∈Rdnb121
such that ξ⊤Lbξ=ξ⊤(L′−B)ξ=0dnb. From the assumption on L′, it follows that ξ∈ker(L′). 122
Furthermore, ξ⊤Bξ=Pnb
k=1ξ⊤
kBkξk= 0. Since each matrix weight in Bk=Pna
j=1[Lab]kjis 123
negative semidefinite, it follows that ξk∈ker([Lab]kj),∀j= 1, . . . , n a, or equivalently L⊤
abξ= 124
0dna. Then, we have L

dna,ξ⊤]⊤∈ker(L). This 125
contradiction implies that Lbmust be positive definite. 126
2.2 Problem formulation 127
This paper aims to give some conditions for stability and/or reaching a consensus when time delays 128
are present in (4)and its expanded versions. Particularly, the following matrix-weighted consensus 129
models with time delays will be studied. 130
Model 1 Matrix-weighted consensus of single-integrators with a uniform constant time-delay τ >0: 131
˙xi(t) =X
j∈NiAijxij(t−τ), (6)
∀i∈ Vb, and ˙xi(t) =0d,∀i∈ Va. 132
Model 2 Matrix-weighted consensus of single-integrators with heterogeneous constant time-delays 133
˙xi(t) =nX
j=1xij(t−τij), (7)
where i∈ Vb,τij≥0is the time-delay associated with an edge (i, j)∈ E, and ˙xi(t) =0d,∀i∈ Va. 134

j(t−τ2)),(8b)
where xk
i= [xk
1i, . . . , xk
di]⊤∈Rd,i∈ Vb, and ˙xk
i(t) =0d,∀i∈ Va,k= 1,2. Here, xi= 136
[(x1
i)⊤,(x2
i)⊤]⊤andx1
1,x2
iare referred to as the position and the velocity of agent i, andα >0is a 137
control gain. 138
For each model, the initial condition is given as x(θ) =x(0),∀θ∈[−τk,0]. 139
3Matrix-weighted consensus of single-integrators with a uniform time-delay 140
In this section, we give condition on the time-delay to ensure the model (6)to asymptotically achieve 141
a consensus for leaderless and leader-follower matrix-weighted networks. 142
43.1 Leaderless network 143
The following theorem provides necessary and sufficient consensus condition for a leaderless matrix- 144
weighted consensus network. 145
Theorem 3.1. Consider a leaderless n-agent network with Va=∅, and rank (L) =dn−l,l≥d. 146
Under the consensus algorithm (6),x(t)asymptotically converges to x∗=RR⊤x(0)∈ker(L)if 147
and only if τ <π
2λdn, where λdnis the largest eigenvalue of L. 148
Proof. The proof of this theorem is given in Appendix A.2. 149
Remark 3.2.Observe that if rank (L) =dn−dand the stability condition τ <π
2λdnholds, then 150
l=d,Pd
p=1pkp⊤
k=1
n(1n1⊤
n⊗Id)and the system asymptotically achieves a consensus. A 151
similar consensus condition was given in [20] for scalar-weighted consensus networks but the proof 152
is different from that of Theorem 3.1. 153
3.2 Leader-follower network 154
Next, we consider the leader-follower network under the consensus law (6). Letxa= [x⊤
1, . . . ,x⊤
na]⊤155
andxb= [x⊤
na+1, . . . ,x⊤
n]⊤respectively denote the stacked vectors of the leader and the follower 156
agents. The behaviors of the network is given in the following theorem. 157
Theorem 3.3. Consider a leader-follower n-agent network with na≥1, rank (L) =dn−l,l≥d, 158
andLbis positive definite. Under the consensus algorithm (6),xbasymptotically converges to 159
x∗
b=L−1
bLabxaif and only if τ <π
2λbmax, where λbmaxis the largest eigenvalue of Lb. 160
Proof. We can write the n-agent network in matrix form as follows 161

˙xb(t)

Θdna0dna×dnb
Lab Lb

xb(t−τ)
. (9)
Asxa(t) =xa(0),∀t≥ −τ, we consider the variable transformation δb(t) =xb(t) +L−1
bLabxa, 162
and derive the equation 163
˙δb(t) =−Lbδb(t−τ). (10)
The proof that the delayed system (10) is asymptotically stable if and only if τ <π
2λbmaxis similar to 164
the proof of Thm. 3.1 and will be omitted. 165
Remark 3.4.It is remarked that if a consensus algorithm is performed in a leader-follower scalar- 166
weighted graph with non-collocated leaders, the followers will asymptotically converge to fixed 167
points inside the convex hull of the leaders’ position. In contrast, as shown in Thm. 3.3, for a 168
matrix-weighted consensus, the convergence points of follower agents may lie outside the convex hull 169
of the leaders’ positions. This property finds application in the bearing-based network localization 170
problem discussed in Section 6. 171
4Matrix-weighted consensus of single integrators with heterogeneous delays 172
In this section, we study the matrix-weighted consensus algorithms with heterogeneous time delays 173
(7). We first study the problem for a leaderless matrix-weighted network and then consider the 174
problem for a leader-follower network. 175
4.1 Leaderless network 176
Due to symmetry, we have τij=τji,∀(i, j)∈ E. We can rewrite the dynamics (7)in the matrix form 177
as follows: 178
˙x(t) =−rX
k=1Lkx(t−τk), (11)
5where r≤ |E| ,τk=τijifek= (i, j), fork= 1, . . . , r , andLk= [Lkij]∈Rdn×dnis a matrix 179
whose d×dblocks are defined by 180
Lkij=

−Aij, j ̸=i, τk=τij,
Θd, j ̸=i, τk̸=τij,
−Pn
j=1,j̸=iLkij, j=i.
It is observed that Lkis a part of the Laplacian matrix corresponding to an update with time delay 181
τk, andL=Pr
k=1Lk. As in the previous section, R⊤Lk=0l×nd, fork= 1, . . . , r . It follows that 182
x∗=RR⊤x(t)is time-invariant. 183
Moreover, we have Lk=PΛkP⊤, where Λk=Θl 0l×(dn−l)
0(dn−l)×l¯Λk
and¯Λk=Q⊤LkQ∈ 184
R(dn−l)×(dn−l). Define δ(t) =Q⊤x(t)∈Rdn−l, then the equation (11) can be rewritten in the 185
following form [13]: 186
˙δ(t) =−rX
k=1Q⊤Lkx(t−τk) =−rX
k=1¯Λkδ(t−τk)
=−¯Λδ(t) +rX
k=1¯Λk(δ(t)−δ(t−τk))
=−¯Λδ(t) +rX
k=1¯ΛkZt
t−τk˙δ(s)ds. (12)
The stability of the system (12) is stated in the following theorem, whose proof can be found in 187
Appendix A.3. 188
Theorem 4.1. Consider the leaderless matrix-weighted consensus network with time delays (12), 189
where rank (L) =dn−l,na= 0andl≥d. Suppose that the time delays τkare sufficient small such 190
that the LMI (13) holds, where τ=Pr
i=1τi.1Then, the origin is a globally uniformly asymptotically 191
equilibrium of (12) andx(t)→x∗∈ker(L)ast→+∞. 192

4.2 Leader-follower network 193
Next, we consider the leader-follower network under the consensus algorithm (7). Similar to 194
the previous section, we can define δb(t) =xb(t) +L−1
bLabxa, where Lab=Pr
k=1Labkand 195
Lb=Pr
k=1Lbbk. That is, each matrix Lkcontributes a part to the matrices LabandLb. Then, 196
˙δb(t) =−rX
k=1Lbkxb(t−τ)−rX
k=1Labkxa=−rX
k=1Lbkδb(t−τ)
=−Lbδb(t) +rX
k=1LbkZt
t−τk˙δb(s)ds. (14)
We can now state a theorem on the delayed-system (14), whose proof is similar to the proof of 197
Theorem 4.1 and will be omitted. 198
Theorem 4.2. Suppose that the n-agent network has a leader follower structure, na≥1, rank (L) = 199
dn−l,l≥d, and Lbis positive definite. If the time delays τkare chosen such that the LMI 200
(15) holds and τ=Pr

where λi>0, i=l+ 1, . . . , dn, are the positive eigenvalues of the matrix-weighted Laplacian 216

6 Bearing-based network localization under time delays 244
We consider a wireless sensor network of nnodes in the d≥2dimensional space. Consider a global 245
coordinate systemgΣ, and let the position of the i-th sensor in the network referred ingΣbe denoted 246
asxi∈Rd. 247
The network is characterized by (G,x), where Gis the interaction graph and x= [x⊤
1, . . . ,x⊤
n]⊤∈ 248
Rdn, the stacked vector of the global positions of nnodes, is referred to as a realization. Each node 249
(or agent), located at xi∈Rd, can measure the bearing vector gij=xj−xi
∥xj−xi∥, which contains the 250
directional information from node ito a neighboring node j∈ Ni. The global position xiis unknown 251
to each agent i, so it needs to update an estimate ˆxi(t)∈Rdofxiand exchange this information 252
with its neighbors. The process of determining the positions of the network’s nodes is called network 253
localization . We assume that the information about the origin of the global coordinate system is 254
unavailable to each agent and each agent maintains a local coordinate systemsiΣ, whose axes are 255
aligned withgΣ. This assumption is feasible since we can firstly conduct an orientation alignment 256
algorithm before performing the network localization process. 257
For each bearing vector gij, there is a corresponding symmetric positive semidefinite matrix Pgij= 258
Id−gijg⊤
ij∈Rd×dsatisfying ker (Pgij) =im(gij)andPgij=P⊤
gij=P2
gij. Observe that Pgijis 259
an orthogonal projection onto ker (gij). The bearing-based network localization algorithm [35, 36] 260
˙ˆxi(t) =−X
j∈NiPgij(ˆxi(t)−ˆxj(t)), i= 1, . . . , n, (22)
can be considered as a matrix-weighted consensus algorithm (3). The network localization algorithm 261
(22) induces the bearing Laplacian Lwith the ij-th off-diagonal block matrix −Pgij. It has been 262
shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for the network under the update law (22) to be 263
determined up to a translation and a scaling is rank (L) =dn−d−1[37]. Thus, the bearing 264
Laplacian corresponds to l=d+ 1, and all theoretical results in Sections 3–5 are applicable for the 265
bearing-based network localization problem with time delays. 266
7 Conclusions 267
In this paper, three leaderless and leader-follower matrix-weighted consensus models with constant 268
time-delays were studied. The stability of the considered models was analysed and several conditions 269
for the system to asymptotically converge to a point in the kernel of the matrix-weighted Laplacian 270
were provided. An application in bearing-based network localization with time-delays was also given. 271
Since the current work only focuses on constant time delay, for further studies, it will be interesting 272
to consider time-varying time-delays or adaptive algorithms for stabilizing the matrix-weighted 273
consensus network with time-delays. 274

Consider the functional differential equation 361

xt0(θ) =φ(θ),∀θ∈[−τ,0], (23b)
where x(t)∈Rn, and the notation xt=x(t+θ),∀θ∈[−τ,0]is adopted. The function f: 362
R× Cn,τ→Rnis continuous in both arguments and is locally Lipschitz in the second argument.2363
Furthermore, it is assumed that f(t,0n) =0n,∀t∈Rso that x≡0nis a solution of the system. 364
2Cn,τ=C[−τ,0]denotes the Banach space of absolutely continuous vector functions φ: [−τ,0]→

(iii)lims→+∞u(s) = +∞, 372
then the solution x(t)≡0nis globally uniformly asymptotically stable. 373
The following lemmas are useful for analysing the stability of time-delay systems. A short introduc- 374
tion to time-delay systems and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii method are given in Appendix A.1 for quick 375

A.2 Proof of Theorem 3.1 383
We rewrite the consensus system (6) in the following matrix form 384
˙x(t) =−Lx(t−τ). (24)
Consider the variable transformation δ(t) =Q⊤x(t). By expressing L=PΛP⊤, we have 385
˙δ(t) =−¯Λδ(t−τ). (25)
AsR⊤˙x(t) =0l,R⊤x(t), which shows that R⊤x(t) =R⊤x(0) =Pl
i=1p⊤
ix(0)is time invariant. 386
Then-agent system (25) asymptotically converges to a point in ker (L)if and only if δ(t)→0dn−l, 387
ast→+∞, or all roots of the characteristic equation 388
det(sIdn+¯Λe−τs) = 0 (26)
must have negative real parts. Equation (26) is equivalent to s+λke−τs= 0,∀k=l+ 1, . . . , dn . 389
Lets=σ+ȷω, where σ, ω∈R, we have 390
σ+ȷω+λke−τ(σ+ȷω)=σ+ȷω+λke−τσ(cos(ωτ)−ȷsin(ωτ))
=σ+λke−τσcos(ωτ) +ȷ(ω−λke−τσsin(ωτ)).
Thus, the roots of (26) satisfy σ=−λke−τσcos(ωτ), ω=λke−τσsin(ωτ). 391
(Necessity) If σ <0,∀ω, it follows that cos(ωτ) = cos( λkωe−τστsin(τω))>0,∀ω. This implies 392
that|λkτe−τσsin(τω)| ≤λkτe−τσ<π
2,∀k=l+ 1, . . . , dn , orτ <πeτσ
2λdn≤π
2λdn. 393
12(Sufficiency) if τ <π
2λdn, because σ2+ω2=λ2
ke−2τσ, it follows that |ω| ≤λke−τσ, and 394
τ|ω| ≤πe−τσ
2. Ifσ≥0, then e−τσ≤1. It follows that cos(τω)≥cos(π
2)≥0, and σ= 395
−λke−τσcos(π
2)≤0. This contradiction implies that σ <0. 396
Therefore, we conclude that σ <0if and only if τ <π
2λdn. 397
Next, let the condition τ <π
2λdnbe satisfied, and x(t) = Φ( t),∀t∈[−τ,0], and Φ(t) =x(0), the 398
Laplace transform of (25) gives 399

A.3 Proof of Theorem 4.1 402

from Eqs. (28) and (29), one gets 409
˙V(δ(t),˙δt)≤(y(t))⊤My(t), (30)
where Mis given in (13). From the assumption that M<0, there exists γ >0such that 410
˙V(δ(t),˙δt)≤ −γ∥δ(t)∥2. (31)
or the origin is a globally uniformly asymptotically stable equilibrium of the system (12) (Appendix 411
A.1). Thus, x(t)→x∗∈ker(L), ast→+∞. 412
The matrix Mis a summation of two matrices, the first one is positive definite when τkare small, 413
and the second one can be made arbitrarily small by choosing τksmall. This implies that the LMI 414
(13) is feasible if τk,k= 1, . . . , r , are sufficiently small. 415
13A.4 Proof of Theorem 5.1 416
Consider the following functionals 417
V1(z(t)) =z⊤Πz,
V2(zt) =τ1Zt
t−τ1(s−t+τ1)(z2(s))⊤¯ΛZ¯Λz2(s)ds,
V3(˙zt) =α2τ3
2Zt
t−τ2(s−t+τ2)(˙z2(s))⊤¯ΛW ¯Λ˙z2(s)ds,
where Z,W∈R(dn−l)×(dn−l)are positive definite matrices. Denoting β1(t) =Rt
t−τ1z2(s)ds,and 418
β2(t) =τ2z2(t)−(z1(t)−z1(t−τ2)), and taking the time derivatives of Vj, j= 1,2,3, we have 419

2Zt
t−τ2(˙z2(s))⊤ˆW˙z2(s)ds,ˆW=¯ΛW ¯Λ. (32c)
Based on Jensen’s inequality, the second term in ˙V2can be evaluated as follows 420

t−τ1(z2(s))⊤ˆZz2(s)ds=Zt

Thus, 421
˙V2≤τ2
1(z2(t))⊤ˆZz2(t)−(β1(t))⊤ˆZβ1(t). (34)
Next, based on Wirtinger’s and Jensen’s inequalities, we have 422

V(z(t),˙zt) = V1(z(t)) + V2(zt) +V3(˙zt), and let η= [z(t)⊤,(¯Λβ1(t))⊤,(¯Λβ2(t))⊤]⊤,we 424

Thus, if the LMI Ξ1+τ4
2Ξ2<0is feasible, the z-system is globally uniformly asymptotically stable. 428
By Schur’s complement, this condition is equivalent to 429
Ξ(τ2)<0. (39)
Thus, ˙V(zt,˙zt)≤ −c∥z∥2for some c >0, or equivalently, z=0is globally uniformly asymp- 430
totically stable (Appendix A.1) and xk(t)→ker(L),k= 1,2, if the LMI (39) is satisfied. Since 431
x2
i(0) = 0d,∀i= 1, . . . , n , due to the observation at the beginning of the Subsection 5.1, we 432
conclude that x2
i(t)→0d,∀i= 1, . . . , n . 433
Finally, we consider the feasibility of the LMI (39). AsF(τ2)is affinely dependent on τ2, letΠbe a 434
solution of the Lyapunov equation (16), thenΠdoes not have any term that is affine dependent on τ2, 435
i.e.,Π=O(1). Letτ1be selected such that τ1=O(τ2
2), 436
F(τ2)⊤Π+ΠF(τ2) =−τI2dn−2l+O(τ2
2).
Choose R=τ−1
1Idn,W=τ−2
2Idn, by Schur complement, the LMI Ξ(τ2)<0gives the approxi- 437
mated evaluation 438
ΠF(τ2) +F(τ2)⊤Π+O(τ2)<0
which is satisfied for small positive τ2. 439
A.5 Simulation results 440
A.5.1 Matrix-weighted consensus models with time delays 441
In this subsection, we consider a matrix-weighted network of 10 agents in R3with the interaction 442
graph as depicted in Fig. 4(a). The edge weights are selected so that rank (L) = 3 n−3 = 27 . We 443
will below simulate the network of 10 agents under different assumptions of the time-delays.

graphGand the true positions xiof10-sensor network in Subsection 6.2.
444
The network has a uniform time-delay : We consider the consensus network with a uniform 445
constant delay. The maximum eigenvalue of the matrix-weighted Laplacian is calculated to be 446
10.9235, and thus, the upper bound of the delay is τmax≈0.1438 (seconds). For τ= 0.1< τmax, 447
Fig. 4(b) shows that the n-agent system asymptotically consents on a common vector. However, for 448
τ= 0.25> τmax, simulation result in Fig. 4(c) shows that the consensus system becomes unstable. 449
The network has heterogeneous time delays : Next, let the matrix-weighted network has 450
heterogeneous edge time delays as given in Table 1. In Simulation 1, the time delays are τ1= 0.05, 451
τ2= 0.10,τ3= 0.15. The system asymptotically achieves a consensus. As shown in Figs. 5(a), 452
heterogeneous delays cause significant fluctuations on the process of reaching an agreement. 453

Figure 5: The simulation results of the matrix-weighted consensus model (7)with multiple delays.
The system asymptotically achieves consensus for τ1= 0.05,τ2= 0.1andτ3= 0.15but being
unstable for τ1= 0.05,τ2= 0.1andτ3= 0.2.

Simulation 1 τ1= 0.05 τ2= 0.10 τ3= 0.15
Simulation 2 τ1= 0.05 τ2= 0.10 τ3= 0.20
For Simulation 2, the time delays are changed to τ1= 0.05,τ2= 0.10,τ3= 0.20. In this case, the 454
system becomes unstable as shown in Fig. 5(c). 455
Consensus of double integrators without velocity measurements : We consider the same matrix 456
weighted graphs and conduct simulations for different values of the time delays τ1,τ2and the control 457
gainkto demonstrate the continuous dependencies of the MWC algorithm (8) with regard to the 458
design parameters. 459
We first fix the time delays τ1= 0.05,τ2= 0.25and vary the control gain kfrom 1.1to0.2. It can 460
be seen that if k= 1.1(exceeding 1) and k= 0.2(being too small so that the LMI does not hold), 461
the system becomes unstable (see Figs. 6(a)– (f)). For k= 0.3,0.5,0.85,1, the agents 462
asymptotically achieve a consensus. It can be observed from Figs. 6(b)–6(e) that when kis smaller, 463
the interaction between agents becomes weaker and thus, more fluctuations are exhibited during the 464
process of reaching a consensus. 465
Second, we fix k= 0.85,τ1= 0.05(sec), and vary τ2. Simulation results corresponding to 466
τ2= 0.25,0.6, and 0.66are shown in Figs. 6(c), (g), (h), respectively. Clearly, after τ2exceeds the 467
limit (about 0.658 (sec)), the network becomes unstable. 468
Third, we fix k= 0.85,τ2= 0.25(sec), and vary τ1. Simulation results are depicted in Figs. 6 (a), 469
(c), (j)–(l), corresponding to τ1= 0,0.05,0.1,0.2,0.22, respectively. As τ1gradually reaches to 470
τ2, the network tends to be less stable, and when τ2= 0.22(sec), the network becomes unstable. 471
Thus, simulation results are consistent with the analysis. 472
A.5.2 Bearing-based network localization with time delays 473
Below, we give simulations of the bearing-based network localization laws with time delays to 474
reinforce our analysis. Specifically, in all simulations in this subsection, a 10-agent network will be 475

considered. The graph Gand the true position of the nodes are given as follows. It can be checked 476
that the bearing Laplacian satisfies rank (L) = 26 . 477
Bearing-based network localization with uniform constant time delays : Consider the 478
bearing-based network localization (6) with a constant time delay. The simulation results are 479
depicted in Figs. 7(a)–(b) for τ= 0.1, and Figs. 7(c)–(d). For τ= 0.1, the estimate ˆxasymptotically 480
converges to an x∗, which differs from the correct position xby a translation and a scaling. For 481
τ= 0.2, after 20 seconds of simulation, it can be observed that ˆxtends to grow unbounded 482
(instability). 483
Bearing-based network localization with heterogeneous time-delays : Next, we simulate the 484
network localization algorithm (7) with parameters given in Table 2. For τ3= 0.2(sec), it is 485
observed from Figures 8(a)–(b) that ˆxconverges to a configuration x∗, and the sum of squared 486
bearing errorsP
(i,j)∈E∥gij−g∗
ij∥2asymptotically converges to zero. Thus, x∗is a configuration 487

satisfying all the sensed bearing vectors. As τ3changes from 0.2 (sec) to 0.3 (sec), the network 488
becomes unstable, as shown in Figs. 8(c)–(d).

Bearing-based network localization of double-integrators with two constant time delays: 490
