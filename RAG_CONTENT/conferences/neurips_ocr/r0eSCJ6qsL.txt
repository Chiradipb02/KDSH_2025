Abstract
Neural network architecture design requires making many crucial decisions. The
common desiderata is that similar decisions, with little modifications, can be reused
in a variety of tasks and applications. To satisfy that, architectures must provide
promising latency and performance trade-offs, support a variety of tasks, scale
efficiently with respect to the amounts of data and compute, leverage available
data from other tasks, and efficiently support various hardware. To this end,
we introduce AsCAN—a hybrid architecture, combining both convolutional and
transformer blocks. We revisit the key design principles of hybrid architectures and
propose a simple and effective asymmetric architecture, where the distribution of
convolutional and transformer blocks is asymmetric , containing more convolutional
blocks in the earlier stages, followed by more transformer blocks in later stages.
AsCAN supports a variety of tasks: recognition, segmentation, class-conditional
image generation, and features a superior trade-off between performance and
latency. We then scale the same architecture to solve a large-scale text-to-image
task and show state-of-the-art performance compared to the most recent public

for transformer blocks, our models still yield faster inference speed than existing
works featuring efficient attention mechanisms, highlighting the advantages and
the value of our approach.
1 Introduction
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers have been deployed in a wide spectrum
of real-world applications, addressing various computer vision tasks, e.g., image recognition [ 1,2]
and image generation [ 3,4,5,6,7,8]. CNNs encode many desirable properties like translation
equivariance facilitated through the convolutional operators [ 9]. However, they lack the input-adaptive
weighting and the global receptive field capabilities offered by transformers [ 10,11]. By recognizing
the potential benefits of combining these complementary strengths, research endeavors explore
hybrid architectures that integrate both convolutional and attention mechanisms [ 12,13,14,15].
Recently, such architectures witness huge success when scaled up to train large-scale text-to-image
(T2I) diffusion models [ 16,17,18,19], enabling a vast range of visual applications, such as content
editing [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] and video generation [27, 28, 29, 30].
One prominent research area for hybrid models involves the creation of building blocks that can
effectively combine convolution and attention operators [ 31,32]. While these efforts seek to use the
strengths of both operators, their faster attention alternatives only approximate the global attention,
leading to compromised model performance as lacking a global receptive field. Thus, they neces-
sitate incorporating additional layers to compensate for the capacity reduction due to the attention
approximation. On the other hand, minimal effort is directed toward optimizing the entire hybrid
architecture. This raises the question: Is the current macro design of hybrid architecture optimal?
In this work, we propose a simple yeteffective hybrid architecture, wherein the number of convolution
and transformer blocks is asymmetric in different stages. Specifically, we adopt more convolutional
blocks in the early stages, where the feature maps have relatively large spatial sizes, and more trans-
former blocks at the later stages. This design is verified across different tasks. For example, in Fig. 3,
we demonstrate superior advantages of our model for the latency-performance trade-off on ImageNet-
1K [33] classification task. Particularly, our model achieves even faster speed than many works fea-
turing efficient attention operations. Additionally, we scale up our architecture to train the large-scale
T2I diffusion model for high-fidelity generation (Fig. 1, Fig. 4, and Tab. 3). Furthermore, considering
the high training cost for the large-scale T2I diffusion models, we introduce a multi-stage training
pipeline to improve the training efficiency. Overall, our contributions can be summarized as follows:
•We revisit the macro design principles of hybrid convolutional-transformer architectures and
propose one with asymmetrically distributed convolutional and transformer blocks.
•For the image classification task, we perform extensive latency analysis on the ImageNet-1K dataset
and show our models achieve superior throughput-performance trade-offs than existing works (see
Fig. 3). Notably, we show that the model runtime can be significantly accelerated even without any
acceleration optimization on attention operations . Additionally, we show our pre-trained models
on ImageNet-1K can be applied to downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation.
•For the class-conditional generation on ImageNet-1K ( 256×256), our asymmetric UNet achieves
similar performance as state-of-the-art models with half the compute resources (see Tab. 4).
•For the text-to-image generation task, we demonstrate that our network can be scaled up for the
large-scale T2I generation with a better performance-latency trade-off than existing public models
(as in Tab. 3). Additionally, we improve the training efficiency through a multi-stage training
pipeline, where we first train the model on a small dataset, i.e., ImageNet-1K, for T2I generation,
then fine-tune the model on a large-scale dataset.
2 Related Works
Efficient Hybrid Architectures. Over the past decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [ 34,
35,36] have achieved unprecedented performance in various computer vision tasks [ 37,38]. Despite
numerous attempts to improve CNNs [ 39,40,41,42,43], they still face limitations, particularly in
terms of their local and restrictive receptive fields. On the other hand, the vision transformer (ViT)
2treats images as sequences of tokens [ 44], facilitating the computation of global dependencies between
tokens to enhance the receptive field. However, ViTs come with quadratic computation complexity
concerning input resolution. To address this, several studies have aimed to develop more efficient
attention operations [ 45,46,47,48,49]. Recently, there has been a growing interest in exploring
models that go beyond pure convolutional or transformer blocks, combining them within a single
architecture to harness the spatial and translational priors from convolutions and the global receptive
fields from the attention mechanism [ 11,31,2,12,32]. We revisit the design choices of hybrid
architectures and propose a new design with a fast runtime while maintaining high performance. We
reveal that optimizing the macro architecture directly allows us to use the original attention for a
superior latency-performance trade-off compared to existing works. Most importantly, our designed
networks can be applied to different domains, e.g., image recognition and image generation, with
both superior latency-performance trade-offs.
Text-to-Image Diffusion Models. The development of text-to-image models, such as GAN-
based models [ 50,7], autoregressive models [ 51,52], and diffusion models [ 3,53], has en-
abled the generation of high-fidelity images by using textual descriptions. Among them, dif-
fusion models demonstrate advantages in stable training processes and the scalability of large-
scale neural networks [ 19,54,55,16,17,13]. Recent studies explore the enhancements of text-
to-image diffusion models through various directions, such as designing new network architec-
tures [ 56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63], improving inference efficiency during multi-steps sam-
pling [ 64,65,66], and accelerating the training convergence [ 67,68,69,70,71]. Our designed
network can be scaled up for the T2I generation when modified to a UNet architecture [ 13]. The
model achieves better performance-latency trade-offs than open-sourced models. Furthermore, we
can reduce the training cost through the proposed two-stage training pipeline.
3 Methods
This section describes our network and training designs in detail. First, we justify our choices of
utilizing the convolutional and transformer operations for the building blocks, which we then use
to design the asymmetric architecture (Sec. 3.1). Second, we scale up the network architecture for
training the text-to-image diffusion models (Sec. 3.3). We point out that it is easier to ablate the
design of building blocks on the image classification task due to the lower resource requirements
(training/evaluation compute) in comparison to image generation.
3.1 Architecture Design: Asymmetric Convolution-Attention Networks (AsCAN)
Our hybrid architecture consists of a mix of convolutional and transformer blocks, which enables oper-
ating on different input resolutions seamlessly and allows us to be pareto efficient w.r.t. performance-
compute trade-off compared to other architectures. Before delving into the exact architecture
configuration, we discuss our choice of the building blocks. We use X∈RH×W×Cto represent
the input feature map Xthat has H×Wspatial dimensions along with Cchannels. We denote
Y∈RH′×W′×C′
as the output of a building block (convolution or transformer) and ◦symbol
for the function composition operator. In the following, we present our design choices based on
ImageNet-1K [72] classification task by varying different convolution and transformer blocks.
Convolutional Block ( C).There are various choices for a convolutional block that can be used in
our architecture, e.g., MBConv [ 73], FusedMBConv [ 1], and ConvNeXt [ 74]. While MBConv block
has been used in many networks [ 75,31], the presence of depthwise convolutions results in low
accelerator utilization for high-end GPUs [ 1]. To better understand the latency-performance trade-off
for various convolutional blocks, we experiment with the same hybrid architecture yet with different
convolutional blocks. As in Tab. 1 (more experimental settings in Sec. 4.1), FusedMBConv has better
latency on A100 and V100 GPUs than others, while maintaining high performance. Therefore, we
adopt FusedMBConv ( C) for the convolutional block and represent it as Y=X+P ◦ SE ◦ C (X),
whereCis a full 3×3convolution with 4×channel expansion followed by batch norm and GeLU
non-linearity [ 76],SEis a squeeze-and-excite operator [ 39] with shrink ratio of 0.25, andPis a
1×1convolution to project to Cchannels.
Transformer Block ( T).Similar to the convolution blocks, there are many choices for attention
mechanism in transformers, e.g., blocks containing efficient attention mechanisms like multi-axial
attention [ 31] and hierarchical attention [ 32]. Tab. 2 shows that vanilla attention mechanism provides

a better accuracy vsthroughput trade-off across different GPUs and batch sizes. Thus, we choose the
vanilla attention in our transformer block ( T). We express it with the following update equations:
Y=X+Yattn+Ymlp;Yattn=P ◦ A ◦ P QKV(ˆX);Ymlp=P ◦ϕ◦ P MLP(ˆX), (1)
where ˆX=LN ◦ ϕ(X),LN denotes layer normalization, ϕdenotes the GeLU non-linearity [ 76],
Ais the multi-headed self-attention function, PQKV&PMLPdenote the linear projection to the QKV
and MLP space, respectively, and Pdenotes the projection operator to the same space as the input.
Note that these update equations are inspired by recent works [ 77,78], where the feed-forward and
the self-attention operators are arranged in parallel in order to get improved throughput with marginal
reduction in performance.
Design Choices. Given the FusedMBConv ( C) and Vanilla Transformer ( T) blocks, we introduce the
macro design for our hybrid architecture. For the image classification task, we follow the existing
works [ 11,31,32] to utilize a four-stage architecture (excluding the convolutional Stem at the
beginning and classifier components at the end). However, before finalizing our architecture, we still
have a design question to answer, namely, in which configuration should we arrange these building
blocks? For instance, CoAtNet [ 11] chooses to stack convolutional blocks in the first two stages and
transformer blocks in the remaining stages while MaxViT [ 31] stacks convolutional and transformer
blocks alternatively throughout the entire network. A formal algorithm requires evaluating all possible
CandTconfigurations, which is computationally expensive. Even neural architecture search leads to
exponential search space. Thus, we follow a naive strategy that is based on the following principles:
•Cbefore T. In any stage, we prefer convolutions followed by transformer blocks to capture the
global dependence between the features aggregated by the convolutions, as they can capture scale
and translation-aware information. Our ablations in Appendix Tab. 9 justify this design choice.
•Fixed first stage. As transformer blocks have quadratic computation complexity in terms of the
sequence length, we prefer the first stage to contain only convolutional blocks to improve the
inference latency.
•Equal blocks in remaining stages. For ease of analysis, we fix the number of blocks in the
remaining stages, i.e., stages 2 to 4, to be four. Once we finalize the basic configuration, we can
scale these stages similar to earlier works [31] to achieve larger models.
•Asymmetric vsSymmetric. We refer to the architectures as symmetric whenever CandTblocks
are distributed equally within a stage. For example, a configuration of CCCC-CCTT-TTTT is
4symmetric since both CandTblocks are equal within a stage. In contrast, the configuration of
CCCT-CCTT-CTTT is asymmetric since CandTblocks are not equal in stages 2 and 4.
Final Architecture. Given these design principles, we list various promising configurations for the
building blocks ( C&T), and analyze their inference throughput and top-1 accuracy. Tab. 2 provides
these configurations along with performance and runtime on different GPUs. For a better comparison
with existing works, we also add the configurations of CoAtNet and MaxViT for reference. From the
results, we can draw the following conclusions:
•Compared to symmetric architecture design, asymmetric distribution of C&Tblocks yield a better
trade-off for throughput and accuracy, as compared by configurations C1-C5 vsC6-C10.
•Higher number of transformer blocks in the early stages result in lower throughput, which can be
observed by comparing the latency for the configurations of C2 vsC10, and C8 vsC9.
•While increasing the number of transformer blocks in the network improves the throughput, it does
not result in improved accuracy, as demonstrated by C6 vsC9.
Given above analysis, we prefer the C1 configuration for simplicity along with better accuracy vs
latency trade-off. Since transformer blocks capture global dependencies, we prefer at least some
blocks in the early layers as well in conjunction with the convolutional blocks. Similarly, we prefer
having few convolutional blocks in the later stages to capture the spatial, translation, or scale aware
features. To be concrete, our final architecture includes a convolutional stem followed by four stages
and the classifier head. In the first stage, we only keep convolutional blocks. In the second stage, we
keep75% convolutional and 25% transformer blocks. This trend is reversed in the final stage. For
the third stage, we keep equal number of convolutional and transformer blocks. We visualize this
configuration in Fig. 2 along with the diagrams representing the convolutional and transformer blocks.
Remarks. For simplicity, in this work, we focus on the configuration in which to combine the C&T
blocks, and leverage vanilla quadratic attention and convolutional mechanisms. We can incorporate
faster alternatives to quadratic attention to further boost the performance and latency trade-offs. We
leave this exploration to future research.
3.2 Discussion
While many works in the literature focus on improving the trade-off between performance and
multiply-add operation counts (MACs), most of the time, MACs do not translate to throughput gains.
It is primarily due to the following reasons:
•Excessive use of operations that do not contribute to MACs. Such tensor operators include reshape,
permute, concatenate, stack, etc. While these operations do not increase MACs, they burden
the accelerator with tensor rearrangement. The cost of such rearrangement grows with the size
of the feature maps. Thus, whenever these operations occur frequently, the throughput gains
drop significantly. For instance, MaxViT [ 31] uses axial attention that includes many permute
operations for window/grid partitioning of the spatial features. Similarly, SMT [ 79] includes many
concatenation and reshape operations in the SMT-Block. It reduces the throughput significantly
even though their MACs are lower than AsCAN (see Appendix Tab. 7).
•MACs do not account for non-linear accelerator behavior in batched inference. Another issue is
that MACs do not account for the non-linear behavior of the GPU accelerators in the presence of
larger batch sizes. For instance, with small batch sizes (B=1), the GPU accelerator is not fully
utilized. Thus, the benchmark at this batch size is not enough. Instead, one should benchmark at
larger batch sizes to see consistency between architectures.
•Lack of efficient CUDA operators for specialized building blocks. Many architectures propose
specialized and complex attention or convolution building blocks. While these blocks offer better
MACs-vs-performance trade-offs, it is likely that their implementation relies on naive CUDA
constructs and does not result in significant throughput gains. For instance, Bi-Former [ 80]
computes attention between top-k close regions using a top-k sorting operation and performs many
gather operations on the queries and keys. Similarly, RMT [81] computes the Manhattan distance
between the tokens in the image. It includes two separate attention along the height and width of
the image. This process invokes many small kernels along with reshape and permute operations.
These specialized blocks would benefit from efficient CUDA kernels.
•Using accelerator-friendly operators. Depending on the hardware, some operators are better than
others. Depth-wise separable convolutions reduce the MACs, yet they may not be efficient for

particular hardware. Excessive use of depth-wise separable convolutions should be avoided in favor
of the full convolutions wherever possible. For instance, MogaNet [ 82] extensively uses depth-wise
convolutions with large kernel sizes and concatenation operations. These operators reduce the
multiply-addition counts, which are not necessarily efficient on high-end GPU accelerators.
3.3 Scaling Up Architecture for Image Generation
We further scale up our architecture for the image generation task, which requires more computation
than the image recognition task. We train our network by utilizing the denoising diffusion probabilistic
models (DDPM) [ 16,17,54] in the latent space [ 13]. The latent diffusion model includes a variational
autoencoder (V AE) [ 83,84] that encodes the image xinto latent zand a diffusion model ˆϵθ(·)with
parameters θ. We utilize UNet [ 18] as the network for the diffusion model. For the T2I generation,
we get the text embedding with Flan-T5-XXL encoder [ 85]. We train the diffusion model following
the noise prediction [16, 17]:
min
θEt∼[1,T],ϵ∼N(0,I)∥ϵ−ˆϵθ(zt,c)∥2, (2)
where tis the time step and Tis the total number of steps, ϵis the added Gaussian noise, and cis the
condition signal. ztis a noisy latent obtained with a pre-defined variance schedule {βt∈(0,1)}t
with the following updates [16]:
zt=√¯αtz+√
1−¯αtϵ;αt= 1−βt; ¯αt=tY
i=1αi. (3)
In the following, we discuss our design for the diffusion model and the multi-stage training pipeline.
3.3.1 Asymmetric UNet Architecture
We follow the existing literature [ 13,8,15,86] to design the UNet architecture for the T2I diffusion
model. Fig. 2 gives an overview of the overall architecture. It consists of three main stages, namely,
Down blocks, Middle Block, and Up blocks. The Up blocks are the reverted reflection of the Down
blocks. In addition, there are skip connections to add the features from Down blocks to Up blocks.
We adopt the V AE from SDXL [ 8] to transform the image to the latent space and carry out the
diffusion in this space. Since the text-to-image generation task requires additional inputs ( i.e., time
and text embeddings), we modify the CandTblocks to incorporate these conditions. Similar to the
existing literature [ 8], we add the time embedding to the Cblocks. Additionally, we add the text
embedding to the Tblocks through a cross-attention operation carried in parallel to the self-attention
operation as shown in Fig. 2(c).
6While the UNet can take arbitrary resolution as input, we notice that adding positional embeddings in
the self-attention operation reduces the artifacts such as duplicate patterns. For this purpose, we add
RoPE [ 87] embeddings for encoding the position information in the Tblocks. Further, we incorporate
query-key normalization using the RMSNorm [ 88] for stable training in lower precision ( bfloat16 ).
3.3.2 Improved Multi-Stage Training Pipeline
Instead of training the T2I network from scratch, we first train the model on a small-scale dataset
and then fine-tune the model on a much larger dataset. It effectively reduces the training cost on the
large-scale scale dataset (see ablation in Appendix Sec. A.6 , Fig 8). This strategy differs from existing
works that perform multi-stage training using different architectures. For instance, PixArt- α[69,71]
trains a class conditional image generation network and modifies it to fine-tune the network for
text-to-image generation. Both our pre-training and fine-tuning tasks use the same architecture for
text-to-image generation. We use the AdamW optimizer [89] with β1= 0.9andβ2= 0.99.
Specifically, in the first stage, we train our model using ImageNet-1K [ 33] for the text-to-image
generation. Following Esser et al. [90], we form the conditioned text prompt as "a photo of a <class
name> ", where class name is randomly chosen from the label of each image. The model is trained
to generate an image with a resolution of 256×256. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model
from the first stage on a much larger dataset. Here we train the model in four phases: First, we
conduct training at the resolution of 256×256for300K iterations with the batch size as 16,384and
4e−4as the learning rate. Second, we continue the training at the resolution of 512×512for200K
iterations with the batch size as 6,144and1e−4as the learning rate. Third, we train the model for
1024×1024 for100K iterations with the batch size as 1,536and5e−5as the learning rate. Finally,
we perform the multi-aspect ratio training such that the model can synthesize images at various
resolution [ 8]. Additionally, we adjust the added noise at different resolution [ 15],i.e.,βTin Eq. (3)
is chosen as 0.01for256×256and0.02for higher resolution (see ablations in Appendix Sec. A.6).
We add an offset noise of 0.05during multi-aspect ratio training similar to earlier works[8].

offs. While some models regress between two hardware ( e.g., MaxViT-S vs SMT-B ), our model
consistently achieves better accuracy vslatency trade-offs. We report additional baselines along with
multiply-add operations count and different batch sizes in Appendix Tab. 7.
74.1 Image Recognition
We scale the AsCAN architecture discussed in Sec. 3.1 to base and large variants following earlier
works [ 31]. We train these variants on the ImageNet-1K[ 72] classification task. We provide the
experimental details (dataset description, architectures, training hyper-parameters) in Appendix
Sec. A.2. Fig. 3 plots the inference speed on a V100 GPU with batch size 16(measured in images
processed per second) and top-1 accuracy achieved on this task for various models. In addition,
Appendix Tab. 7 shows the parameter count and inference speed on both V100 and A100 GPUs along
with additional details such as floating-point multiply-add count (FLOPs/MACs) and inference speed
across different batch sizes. Below, we highlight the salient observations from these experiments.
•More than 2×higher throughput across accelerators. Compared to the existing hybrid architectures
such as FasterViT [ 32] and MaxViT [ 31], the proposed AsCAN family achieves similar or better
top-1 accuracy with more than 2×higher throughput. This trend holds true for both A100 and
V100 GPUs. For instance, on A100 with batch= 16, FasterViT-1 achieves 83.2%top-1 accuracy
with throughput as 1123 images/s, while AsCAN-T has 83.44% with throughput as 3224 images/s.
•Better throughput across different batch sizes. AsCAN consistently achieves better throughput
across batch sizes for both the accelerators compared to baselines.
•Better storage and computational footprint. AsCAN-family of architectures requires less number
of parameters and float operations to achieve similar performance. For example, to achieve nearly
85.2%accuracy, MaxViT-L requires 212M parameters and 43.9G MACs whereas AsCAN-L
requires 173M parameters and 30.7G MACs.
•We achieve better latency vs.accuracy trade-off than hybrid architectures with better alternatives to
the attention mechanisms in transformer. For instance, we outperform newer architectures such as
PVTv2[91], MOAT[92], EfficientViT[93], and Scale-Aware Modulation Transformers[79].
Further, we observe similar trends when we scale these models to pre-training on ImageNet-21K [94]
dataset (see Appendix Sec. A.2.3) as well as semantic segmentation task (Appendix A.3).
Table 3: GenEval Scores. We use this benchmark to compare T2I models on various aspects of
generation, including counting, color attribution, position, etc. It clearly shows that our model
achieves better overall score, by convincingly outperforming pipelines such as PixArt- αand SDXL.

4.2 Class Conditional Generation
We apply our asymmetric UNet architecture to learn class conditional image generation on the
ImageNet-1K dataset with 256×256resolution. We train a smaller variant of our asymmetric
UNet architecture (as in Sec. 3.3.1) with nearly 400M parameters and inject the class condition
through cross-attention mechanism. We train this model using DDPM [ 16] (more details in Appendix
Sec. A.7), and provide results in Tab. 4. As can be seen, we achieve Fréchet Inception Distance
(FID) [ 95] close to state-of-the-art models with nearly half the FLOPs ( e.g., Ours vs.DiT-XL/2-G),
and better FID than the existing work with similar computation ( e.g., Ours vs.U-ViT-L/2).
4.3 Text-to-Image Generation
Below, we evaluate our T2I asymmetric UNet architecture trained using the multi-stage training.
GenEval Benchmark. We evaluate our model on the GenEval [ 97] benchmark that studies various
aspects of an image generation model. Tab. 3 shows that our model outperforms fast training pipelines
such as PixArt- αby a significant margin. It beats even larger models such as SDXL which consume
significantly more training data and computational resources.

Figure 4: Qualitative Comparison against open source and commercial models. We compare
our T2I model against generations from different baselines. We illustrate that many times existing
models generate images with less photo-realism (either lot less details or more on the cartoonish side),
specially for PixArt- αand PixArt- Σ. Further, they frequently miss the fine-grained details explicitly
asked in the prompts. We highlight these mistakes in red color in the input prompt. For instance, in
the above generations (ordered A →F from top to bottom row), baselines miss details such as, (A)
lack of realism (B) light blue jeans, (C) white sunglasses, (D) black, orange, and white feathers, (E)
grey scarf & back towards camera, and (F) gray knitted hat with dark blue-brown patterns.
Qualitative Comparison. Fig. 4 shows a qualitative comparison between different methods. We
highlight salient differences between the baselines and our generations. Baselines such as PixArt- α
and PixArt- Σtend to generate images with much less photo-realism and more often it is much more
on the cartoonish side or it has grainy artifacts. Similarly, SDXL with refiner framework is unable to
adapt to long text prompts due to limitations of the CLIP text-encoder. Hence, it misses many key
features described in the prompts. In contrast, our model is able to follow the long prompts while
adhering to the required semantics as well as photo-realism.
Human Preference study. We perform a user study to compare open-sourced models to evaluate
their image-text alignment characteristics. We select 1000 prompts from our validation set and
generate images from SDXL, PixArt- α, PixArt- Σ, and our multi-aspect ratio model. We show these
results in the Fig. 5. It shows that our model convincingly outperforms both SDXL and PixArt- α
generations, while it has similar image-text alignment as PixArt- Σmodel. To further evaluate these
models, we generate 10K images from our validation set (described in Appendix A.5.2) and compute
the FID [ 95] between the generated and original images. We show these scores in Tab. 5, which

with better image-text alignment. It shows that we out-
perform SDXL and PixArt- α. While our performance is
on par with PixArt- Σ, Tab. 5 shows that we yield more
realistic generations.Table 5: Validation Data Evaluation.

clearly indicates that our generations align well with the real-world images. This is also evident from
our earlier comparison on qualitative visualization in Fig. 4.
Resource Efficiency. We compare the resource requirements of our model against various baselines
in Appendix Tab. 12. It shows that we achieve better inference latency compared to many existing
models. Further, we consume considerably less compute to achieve much better performance than
many existing baselines as illustrated by evaluations in the previous section.
5 Conclusion
In this work, we design hybrid architectures comprising convolutional and transformer blocks with
applications to many computer vision tasks. We focus on developing a simple hybrid model with
better throughput and performance trade-offs. Instead of designing efficient alternatives to the
convolutional and transformer (mainly attention mechanism) blocks, we leverage existing vanilla
attention along with the FusedMBConv block to design the new architecture, called AsCAN. Our
main philosophy revolves around the uneven distribution of the convolutional and transformer blocks
in the different stages of the network. We refer to this distribution as asymmetric , in the sense that
it favors more convolutional blocks in the early stages with a mix of few transformer blocks, while
it reverses this trend favoring more transformer blocks in the later stages with fewer convolutional
blocks. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture through extensive evaluations
across the image recognition task, class conditional generation, and text-to-image generation.

16A Appendix
A.1 Image Recognition Architecture Details
We describe the three AsCAN variants (tiny, base, and large) used in the experiments (see Sec. 4.1) in
the Tab. 6. We follow earlier works [ 31] to scale the tiny variant discussed in Sec. 3.1. Note that the
stem consists of two convolutional layers that downsample the input to half the spatial resolution.
The classifier stage projects the final feature map to the corresponding embedding size and performs
adaptive average pooling to reduce the spatial dimensions to 1×1, in order to apply a feed-forward
layer that acts as classifier head on top of these pooled features. Our convolution blocks use the
batch-norm as the normalization layer while the transformer blocks leverage the layer-norm as the
normalization layer. We also learn the relative positional embeddings in our attention mechanism
similar to earlier works [31, 32, 46].
Table 6: Architecture Details. We provide detailed configuration of the three variants of the
AsCAN proposed in this work, namely, tiny, base, and large. As per our method section, we use
FusedMBConv ( C) as the convolution block and Vanilla Transformer ( T) as the transformer block.
We refer the reader to the Fig. 2 for their detailed description and schematic of these building blocks.
We use Kto denote the number of classes. Note that we hide the activation and normalization layers
in the blocks. We use GeLU activation and batch-normalization in the Stem and the classifier stages.

A.2 ImageNet Classification (Training Procedure & Hyper-parameters)
We follow the same training strategy for our ImageNet experiments in Sec. 3.1 and Sec. 4.1. We
report the top-1 accuracy on the single center crop image. For training ImageNet-1K models with
224×224resolution, we use the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 3e−3for300
epochs. We use a batch size of 4096 images during this training period. We follow a cosine schedule
for decaying the learning rate to the minimum learning rate of 5e−6. We also perform a learning
rate warm-up to avoid instabilities during the training. We follow a 20epoch warm-up schedule with
an initial learning rate of 5e−7that gets warmed up to the peak learning rate.
For all our experiments, we use standard data augmentation strategies. We use RandAugment [ 98]
with parameters (2,15), MixUp [ 99] with α= 0.8, color jittering with 0.4as the weight, and
label smoothing with 0.1as the smoothing parameter. We also use 0.05value for the weight decay
regularization and perform an exponential model averaging with a decay value of 0.9999 . In addition,
we adopt gradient clipping with a gradient norm of 1.0to avoid instabilities during the training of
such large models. We also enable stochastic depth for regularization. We use the stochastic depth of
0.3/0.4/0.5for the three variants in our experiments.
A.2.1 ImageNet-1K
We benchmark various existing architectures on two accelerators (NVIDIA A100 and V100 GPUs)
with different batch sizes to evaluate the inference speed of a single forward pass. Additionally, we
17train the three AsCANvariants with the training procedure described in earlier sections. We show the
full results corresponding to the Fig. 3 in the Tab. 7. We also include inference memory consumed by
various recent works in Tab. 8.
A.2.2 Ablations on Architecture Configuration
One of the AsCAN design principles include preferring Cblocks over Tblocks in a stage. We demon-
strated various architecture configurations using this design choice in Tab. 2. For completeness, we
reverse this design choice and prefer Tblocks over Cblocks in a stage. We show these configurations
in Tab. 9. Using Tblock in stem / early layers result in lower throughput. Further, the performance of
configurations with Tbefore Cyields lower accuracy vs throughput trade-off.
A.2.3 ImageNet-21K
We also study the effects of pre-training the AsCAN family on larger datasets such as ImageNet-
21K [ 72]. Similar to earlier works, we pre-train our models on the ImageNet-21K dataset. We use the
pre-processed version of this dataset for ease of usage [ 94]. Following previous works [ 11,31], we
train the AsCAN model for 90epochs on the ImageNet-21K dataset and fine-tune these weights on the
ImageNet-1K classification task. Similar to the ImageNet-1K experiments, we use RandAugment [ 98]
with parameters (2,5), MixUp [ 99] with α= 0.2, color jittering with 0.4as the weight and label
smoothing with 0.01as the smoothing parameter. We also use 0.01value for the weight decay
regularization. Additionally, we perform an exponential model averaging with a decay value of
0.9999 and gradient clipping with a gradient norm of 1.0to avoid instabilities during training such
large models. We also enable stochastic depth for regularization. We use the stochastic depth of
0.4/0.5/0.6for the three variants in our experiments.
We report the performance in Tab. 10, where we observe similar top-1 accuracy as the other baselines
while achieving much better inference throughput. This trend is similar to the one we observed in
Sec. 4.1 when these models trained only on the ImageNet-1K dataset without any pre-training on the
ImageNet-21K dataset.
A.3 ADE20K Semantic Segmentation
Dataset Details. ADE20K [ 104] is a popular scene-parsing dataset used to evaluate the semantic
segmentation performance. It consists of 20K train and 2K validation images over 150fine-grained
semantic categories. Images are resized and cropped to 512×512resolution for training.
Training Procedure & Hyper-parameters. We base our semantic segmentation experiments on the
widely used and publicly available mmsegmentation library [ 105]. We use the UPerNet [ 106] as our
semantic segmentation architecture wherein different hybrid architectures are used as the backbones
to extract the spatial feature maps. We extract the spatial feature maps at stages S2, S3, and S4,
and forward these feature maps to the semantic segmentation network. All three AsCAN variants
(tiny, base, large) have been initialized with the weights pre-trained on the ImageNet-1K task with
224×224resolution. Training is performed in 512×512resolution. Similar to FasterViT [ 32], we
follow a similar schedule for training these segmentation models with an AdamW optimizer with
a learning rate of 1e−4, and a weight decay of 0.05. We use a batch size of 16on 8 A100 GPUs.
We also use stochastic depth similar to ImageNet training for controlling overfitting during these
experiments.
Experimental Setup. We train UperNet [ 106] as segmentation architecture on the ADE20K dataset.
We use the proposed AsCAN as the backbone pre-trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset. We use
the AdamW optimizer [ 89] with learning rate 1e−4and weight decay 0.05. Following earlier
works [ 32,74], we train the models for 160K iterations using the mmsegmentation library [ 105]. We
train these networks on 8NVIDIA A100 GPUs using 16as the batch size. We compute the various
inference statistics with 512×512as the image resolution.
Experimental Results. We compare the performance of various backbones in Tab. 11. It shows
that the proposed backbone achieves competitive mIoU while achieving nearly 1.5×faster inference
latency compared to the baselines, measured using the frames per second metrics. This fact can be
observed across different scaling of the backbones. For instance, the Swin-T backbone achieves
latency of 44FPS while AsCAN-T achieves 64FPS as the latency with similar mIoU. Thus, our
18models achieve a similar performance- vs.-latency trend at the downstream semantic segmentation
task as the classification benchmark.
A.4 T2I Dataset Details
We curate our training dataset with careful filtration on diverse data sources using first-party and
licensed datasets. We depict this entire process in Fig. 6. We start by collating all these data sources to
create a stream of images and if available, relevant text captions. Next stage, we add a series of filters
to improve the quality of the selected images (resolution, de-duplication, aesthetic score, nsfw filtering,
etc.). Since this data mostly contains very short descriptions or almost non-existent descriptions of
the image, we unify the captioning process using an image captioning model. We collect a subset of
200K data for human annotations, where we ask the annotators to add details such as the <angle
shot of the image> ,<image background information> ,<human attributes> ,etc. We
use this labeled data to fine-tune a BLIP2 [ 107] model which is used to generate long captions similar
to this format.

of our T2I dataset.
19A.5 T2I Evaluation Details.
A.5.1 Resource Usage
We compare the resource usage of various existing methods with our proposed T2I model. Tab. 12
shows the parameter count of the model, training compute cost, and the inference cost per image
generation.
A.5.2 Evaluation on Internal Data
We evaluate our models against various baselines on two internally captioned datasets (Set-A-10K
and Set-B-10K). We draw these datasets from our validation set. We compute the FID between
the generated 10K images against the reference images in Tab. 5. This table also shows that fast
training pipelines like PixArt- αand PixArt- Σsuffer considerably when evaluated on real-world
images compared to models like SDXL and Ours. We also point out that SDXL has been trained with
a considerably larger dataset compared to ours and uses much more computational resources.
A.6 Hyper-parameter Setup for Text-to-Image Generation
Since full-scale text-to-image generation task is a computationally expensive task, it becomes crucial
that we choose appropriate hyper-parameters and initialization of the model before training it on the
entire dataset. Thus, we choose a proxy task that can be run on a small scale and guide us in the
suitable training configurations.
ImageNet-1K T2I Generation Task. We resort to the ImageNet-1K dataset since it contains a variety
of objects ( 1000 objects) in different settings. Earlier works such as Pixart- α, train their transformer
architecture on the ImageNet-1K class-conditional generation tasks, wherein they incorporate the
text condition via a cross-attention mechanism. This process requires the model to forget the class
condition and adapt to the text condition. In this work, along the lines of [ 90], we simply convert
the ImageNet-1K classification dataset to Text-to-Image dataset by adding the text corresponding
to the <class name> , with the template "a photo of a <class name> ". Specifically, the dataset
provides various different names corresponding to each class, we pick up one at random during
training to learn diverse text mappings. We evaluate the models by computing the FID between the
50K generated images and the reference images from the dataset.
Embedding Pre-Computation. Our T2I model performs diffusion in the latent space. To keep
parity between this task and the full training, we also pre-compute the SDXL V AE embeddings of the
ImageNet-1K dataset. Similarly, we pre-compute Flan-T5-XXL embeddings for the text condition.
This saves training resources since loading V AE and Flan-T5-XXL encoders consumes significant
GPU memory as well as non-trivial computation time. Thus, by pre-computing these embeddings,
we increase the batch size available for training the UNet model.
Architecture Details. We use similar configuration for the Cblocks as in the image recognition
architecture. All our convolutional operators use 3×3kernel sizes. The number of output channels
in the three Down blocks are {320,640,1280}. Since the three Upblocks are reflections of the Down
blocks, their output channels are in the reverse order, i.e.,{1280,640,320}. Given that we use the
SDXL V AE to convert the 3−channel RGB-image into 4−channel latent space, our number of input
channels is 4for the convolution operator in the first Down block. The number of attention heads in
the three Tblocks in the three Down stages are {5,10,20}. Since our Tblocks are applied after C
blocks, the number of output channels of the convolutional blocks along with the number of attention
heads, determine the attention dimension for the transformer block. Finally, we compute the time-step
and textual embeddings. The time-step integer values are converted to timestep embedding by first
converting it into sinusoidal space and then projecting it through two linear layers. We process the
textual embeddings using two Tblocks for adapting the frozen embeddings (dimension 4096 ) for T2I
generation with just one head and the same dimension as the frozen embeddings.
Noise Level Ablation for Different Resolutions. Since our training strategy involves jumping
resolutions from 256→512→1024 , we ablate on the noise levels at each of these resolutions. We
use the DDPM noise scheduler for injecting the noise and the level of noise is controlled by the βT
hyper-parameter. We try four different noise levels {0.01,0.02,0.03,0.04}, and compute the FID
scores. We plot these scores in Fig. 7. We find that at resolution 256, noise level 0.01produces the
best FID score, and at remaining resolutions, noise level 0.02works the best.

resolutions with different learning rate and weight decay parameters. We plot the FID scores against
a reference image set from the dataset.
T2I Task Initialization Ablation. We analyze initializing the 256×256resolution training with and
without pre-training from the ImageNet-1K T2I pre-trained model. As shown in Fig. 8, pre-training
helps improve the performance of the model compared to training from scratch.

A.7 ImageNet-1K Class Conditional Generation.
We learn a class conditional image generation on the ImageNet-1K dataset with image resolution
256×256. We train a smaller variant of our asymmetric UNet architecture (as in Sec. 3.3.1) with
nearly 400M parameters and inject the class condition through the cross-attention mechanism. We
train this model using the DDPM scaled linear noise schedule for 1000 time steps. The training is
conducted for 1000 epochs with a batch size of 2048 . We use AdamW optimizer with 6e−4as the
learning rate, 0.01as the weight decay, and (β1, β2) = (0 .9,0.99). We use an 8−channel V AE to
convert the input image space into a latent space for latent diffusion. We compare our results with
other class conditional models in Tab. 4. Our asymmetric architecture for this task is similar to the T2I
UNet architecture described earlier. To lower down the compute footprint, we reduce the number of
channels to {160,320,640}and reduce the cross-attention dimension from 4096 to768. We evaluate
our model with two configurations and report these two FID scores. In the first configuration, we
apply a classifier-free guidance (cfg) scale [ 96] of1.78to generate the class-conditioned images. In
the second configuration (sampled cfg), we apply the guidance in the steps [5,30]with a cfg scale in
the increasing range [1.1,3.6]. This sampling procedure is similar to the one proposed in MUSE [ 23].
We use the Heun [19] discrete scheduler for inference with 30sampling steps.
21A.8 Limitations
We develop hybrid architectures with asymmetric distribution of the convolution and transformer
blocks. We show that this design paradigm is generic and applicable to many vision tasks such as
image recognition, semantic segmentation, and text-to-image generation. We expect this architecture
design to be widely useful for other applications. From the architecture design perspective, our
building blocks are not rigid and can be replaced with other efficient alternatives of the chosen CandT
blocks. Currently, we focus on the vanilla attention mechanism, but we can certainly incorporate faster
alternatives to quadratic attention without sacrificing any efficiency advantages. Since we demonstrate
an application of the asymmetric design to the UNet framework, we list out some limitations of our
text-to-image generation model, which is broadly similar to various existing text-to-image models.
•Extra limbs. While our model is able to generate limbs for humans and animals very well in most
cases. There are instances where we can observe extra limbs in generations. It is unclear if this is
due to a poorly learned diffusion process, poor captioning guidance, lack of granular information in
image-caption pairs, or just an artifact of the V AE encoder while converting to the latent space.
•Artifacts in extreme resolutions. We train our T2I model with multi-aspect ratio bucketing. While it
is able to adapt to many different resolutions in a graceful manner, we find that the model generates
duplicate patterns in the extremes of the aspect ratio (significantly higher width than height or
vice-versa). We believe this is due to the lack of training data in such resolutions.
•While we are much better at avoiding NSFW generations compared to baselines (due to careful
curation of the training data), there might be a slight percentage of NSFW content, due to leakage
in various filtration processes in the dataset curation. Thus, we incorporate an additional NFSW
filter on top of the generation to remove such edge cases.
A.9 Societal Impact
We design the asymmetric architecture and show the advantages it brings in many applications (image
recognition, semantic segmentation, and text-to-image generation). Our architecture design targets
a better trade-off between efficiency (training/inference latency) while achieving achieving good
performance. In itself, the asymmetric design would reduce the amount of resources utilized by deep
neural networks used commonly in vision tasks. The downstream applications of this architecture,
especially in Text-to-Image generation need to be deployed with care. We expect the community
to utilize proper care w.r.t. training data as well as the generated output. There needs to be special
checks in place while preparing the training data for T2I tasks. We specially add various filters to
remove malicious and harmful content from the dataset. Further, even generated images need to be
processed with some filtration to remove similar harmful and malicious content.
A.10 Text-to-Image Generation Results.
For visualization purposes, we generate more images with different prompts using our multi-aspect
ratio model. We present these images in Fig. 9, 10, and 11. It shows that our model is able to generate
a wide range of images, both very realistic as well as stylistic images. In addition, it is able to grasp
various concepts and compositions.

of our asymmetric architectures, AsCAN, against baselines. We report the inference latency as
the throughput (images per second) that is measured by inferring images with batch size as Bin
half-precision, i.e., fp16, on an A100 GPU using torch-compile and benchmark utility from timm
library [ 100]. A similar procedure (without torch-compile) is followed to obtain the throughput on
the V100 GPU.

28NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our claims in the abstract and introduction regarding the efficiency and
performance trade-offs of the asymmetrically distributed convolution-attention networks,
reflect the paper’s contributions. We design these new architectures for image recognition,
semantic segmentation, and text-to-image applications. We show these applications and
architecture modifications and advantages in our empirical evaluations.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes. We describe the limitations in Appendix Sec. A.8.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
29Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No theoretical results included in this work.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We describe the architecture configurations used in this work in detail in
the main and appendix sections. We also describe the hyper-parameter configurations
used to train this model (training iterations, optimizer, learning rate, weight decay, data
augmentation, etc.)
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
30some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We plan to release our asymmetric architecture implementation for facilitating
future research in this direction.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the experimental settings and details for experiments conducted in
this work (see Sec. A.2, Sec. A.3, Sec. 3.3.2).
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Similar to earlier works on ImageNet-1K and Text-to-Image generations, we
do not report any error bars due to high computational resources involved in training one
run.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
31•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, we describe the amount of resources required to train our models, includ-
ing the hardware type. We also provide the total number of iterations/epochs required to
reproduce the reported results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have reviewed the code of ethics and our research work conforms to this
code.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
32Justification: We discuss the societal impacts of this work in the appendix Sec. A.9.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, we discuss various safeguards both for preparing training data as well as
serving the generated images for our text-to-image generation model.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: For our image recognition and semantic segmentation experiments, we use
the widely available ImageNet-1K and ADE20K datasets. We cite these resources in the
work. For the T2I experiments, we use first party and licensed datasets. We depict this entire
process in Fig. 6. We start by collating all these data sources to create a stream of images
and if available, relevant text captions. Next stage, we add a series of filters to improve the
quality of the selected images (resolution, de-duplication, aesthetic score, nsfw filtering,
etc.). Since this data most contains very short description or almost non-existent description
33of the image, we unify the captioning process using an image captioning model. We collect a
subset of 200K data for human annotations, where we ask the annotators to add details such
as the <angle shot of the image>, <image background information>, <human attributes>,
etc. We use this labelled data to fine-tune a BLIP2 model which is used to generate long
captions similar to this format.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No new assets introduced in this work.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our research does not involve research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
34Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our research does not involve research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
