Abstract
Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enable models to generalize to unseen target
domains by learning from multiple source domains. Existing DG methods primar-
ily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which inherently learn texture
biases due to their limited receptive fields, making them prone to overfitting source
domains. While some works have introduced transformer-based methods (ViTs) for
DG to leverage the global receptive field, these methods incur high computational
costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Recently, advanced state
space models (SSMs), represented by Mamba, have shown promising results in
supervised learning tasks by achieving linear complexity in sequence length during
training and fast RNN-like computation during inference. Inspired by this, we
investigate the generalization ability of the Mamba model under domain shifts and
find that input-dependent matrices within SSMs could accumulate and amplify
domain-specific features, thus hindering model generalization. To address this
issue, we propose a novel SSM-based architecture with saliency-based token-aware
transformation (namely START), which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) perfor-
mances and offers a competitive alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Our START can
selectively perturb and suppress domain-specific features in salient tokens within
the input-dependent matrices of SSMs, thus effectively reducing the discrepancy
between different domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demon-
strate that START outperforms existing SOTA DG methods with efficient linear
complexity. Our code is available at https://github.com/lingeringlight/START.
1 Introduction
Deep learning models have achieved impressive progress in various computer vision tasks over the
past years [ 1–3]. Such a huge success is mostly based on the independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) assumption, i.e., the training and testing data follow the same distribution [ 4]. However, when
evaluated on test data following different distributions from the training data, these models often
suffer severe performance degradation. This issue, which is known as domain shift [ 4], has greatly
hindered the applications of deep learning models in the real world.
To improve the generalization of the model under domain shifts, Domain Adaptation (DA) has been
widely studied, which aims to transfer the knowledge learned from labeled source domains to the
unlabeled or partially labeled target domain [ 5,6]. However, DA methods cannot guarantee the
performance of the model on unknown target domains that have not been observed during training
[7,8]. Since the accessibility of the target domain could not always be satisfied in real scenarios,

1.01.11.21.31.41.51.6Figure 1: Analysis of the input-dependent matrices in SSMs. We investigate domain discrepancy
in the input sequence x, response sequence y, and the input-dependent matrics ˜∆,B, and C. The
results indicate that the input-dependent matrices can accumulate the domain-specific features during
the recurrent process, potentially increasing domain gap. We experiment on PACS [ 24] with Sketch
as the target domain, analyzing the representations from the last block of VMamba backbone [22].
Domain Generalization (DG) is proposed to develop a domain-generalizable model on unseen target
domains by learning multiple different but related source domains [8, 9].
Most existing DG methods focus on learning domain-invariant representations across source domains,
primarily via domain alignment [ 10,11], meta-learning [ 7,12], and data augmentation [ 13,14].
These methods heavily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have limited receptive
fields due to local convolutions. Consequently, the CNN-based methods inevitably tend to learn
local texture information, leading to overfitting to source domains and poor generalization on target
domains[ 15,16]. Recent works in DG have introduced Vision Transformers (ViTs) as the backbone
for DG, utilizing the global receptive field of the self-attention mechanism to mitigate local texture
bias [ 17–19]. However, the complexity of self-attention increases quadratically with input length,
resulting in significant computational overhead for ViTs when modeling long sequences [20, 21].
To address this issue, some pioneers have proposed advanced state space models (SSMs) [ 20,22,23],
represented by Mamba [ 20], which selectively models token dependencies in input sequences in a
compressed state space. The selective scan mechanism allows Mamba to achieve linear complexity
in sequence length during training and fast RNN-like computation during inference. Despite the
remarkable performance of Mamba-based methods on supervised learning tasks, few existing works
have analyzed the generalization ability of Mamba under domain shift. It remains an open question
whether the Mamba model can achieve excellent performance for DG tasks.
In this paper, we theoretically analyze the generalization error bound of the Mamba model under
domain shifts. We find that the domain distance of features extracted by the model is strongly
related to the input-dependent matrices within the model. These matrices accumulate and amplify
domain-specific features during training, which exacerbates the overfitting issue of the model to
source domains. We empirically measure the distance among source domains within the input
sequence x, the response sequence y, and the input-dependent matrices of the last network layer. As
shown in Fig. 1, we observe that for the baseline model, input-dependent matrices ( ˜∆,B, andC) are
prone to learning domain-specific features from the input x. Since the output yis calculated by the
recurrent product of xand these matrices, domain-specific features are accumulated and amplified,
causing the model to overfit the source domains. To address this issue, we propose a Generalized State
Space Model with Saliency-driven Token-Aware Transformation (START), which can reduce domain-
specific information in input-dependent matrices during training. Building on the latest Mamba-based
model [ 22], we develop a strong baseline for DG that outperforms many SOTA DG methods, which
selectively learns global dependencies among tokens with linear complexity in sequence length.
2Moreover, based on theoretical analysis, we design the saliency-driven token-aware transformation
method, which simulates domain shifts during training by selectively introducing style perturbations
to tokens focused on by the input-dependent matrices. START constrain these matrices to learn
domain-invariant features, thus mitigating the overfitting of model on source domains. Experiments
on five datasets prove the effectiveness of our method. Our contributions are summarized as follows:
•We conduct a theoretical investigation into the generalization ability of the Mamba model,
revealing that the input-dependent matrices in Mamba can accumulate domain-specific
features during the recurrent process, thus hindering the model’s generalizability.
•Based on theoretical analysis, we propose a novel SSM-based architecture with saliency-
driven token-aware transformation as a competitive alternative to CNNs and ViTs for DG,
which performs excellent generalization ability with efficient linear complexity.
•For the saliency-driven token-aware transformation, we explore two variants to identify and
perturb salient tokens in feature sequences, effectively reducing domain-specific information
within the input-dependent matrices of Mamba. Our method achieves SOTA performances,
e.g., yielding the best CNN-based method by 5.87% (58.27% vs.52.40%) on TerraIncognita.

Domain generalization. Traditional DG methods, primarily based on CNN backbones, can be
broadly classified into three categories: domain alignment, meta-learning, and data augmentation.
Motivated by the learning theory of domain adaptation [ 4,25], domain alignment methods seek
to learn domain-invariant representations through adversarial learning [ 10,26,27], causal learning
[28,29], or feature disentanglement [ 30,31]. Another popular way to address DG is meta-learning,
which partitions the training data from multiple source domains into meta-train and meta-test sets to
simulate domain shifts during training [ 7,12,32]. Data augmentation is also an effective method to
enhance model robustness to domain shifts by generating diverse data invariants through adversarial
generation [ 33,34], style perturbation [ 13,14], and learnable parameters [ 35,36]. However, CNN-
based DG methods suffer from the limited receptive field of convolutions, often leading to a texture
bias and overfitting to source domains [ 15,37]. To address this, some researchers have introduced
ViT-based methods for DG, which capture global representations by leveraging long-range spatial
dependencies with attention mechanisms [ 18,17,19]. Despite their advantages, ViT-based methods
are computationally intensive due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism,
limiting their practical applications [ 20,21]. Inspired by the emerging Mamba model [ 20,22,23], we
explore a novel SSM-based architecture for DG that combines strong generalizability with efficient
linear complexity. We theoretically analyze the generalization error bound of Mamba and design
a novel saliency-driven token-aware transformation to suppress domain-specific features in the
input-dependent matrices of Mamba, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of the model.
State space models. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have demonstrated promising performance
across various vision tasks [ 38–40] for their ability to effectively capture long-range dependencies
while maintaining linear scalability with sequence length. Derived from the classical state space
model [ 41], the Structured State Space Sequence Model (S4) [ 42] addresses computational constraints
through novel parameterizations catering to continuous-time, recurrent, and convolutional views of
the state space model. Notably, Mamba [ 20] has emerged as a standout performer, which integrates
selection mechanism and hardware-aware algorithms into previous works [ 43–45], thus achieving
linear-time inference and efficient training mechanisms. Based on the success of Mamba, Vision
Mamba (Vim) [ 23] applies Mamba to ViT architecture, combining bidirectional SSM for data-
dependent global visual context modeling. Meanwhile, VMamba [ 22] designs a cross-scan module
to bridge the gap between 1D array scanning and 2D plain traversing. Mamba-based architectures
have exhibited superior performance across various supervised vision tasks, including medical image
segmentation [ 46–48], point cloud analysis [ 49–51], and remote sensing analysis [ 52,53]. However,
few works explore the performance of Mamba under domain shifts for DG. Although DGMamba
[54] has recently introduced a pioneering Mamba-based framework for DG, it lacks a deep analysis
of the generalizability of Mamba. In the paper, we conduct a theoretical analysis of Mamba’s
generalizability, revealing that input-dependent matrices within Mamba could accumulate domain-
specific information, thereby impeding model generalization. Consequently, we propose a generalized
SSM-based architecture for DG, incorporating a non-parametric module to selectively perturb salient
tokens within input-dependent matrices, thus enhancing model generalization to unseen domains.
33 Method
3.1 Preliminary
State Space Models (SSMs). The SSM is a type of linear time-invariant systems that map input
sequence xt∈RLto response sequence yt∈RLthrough a hidden state ht∈RN. Mathematically,
this process is formulated as the subsequent linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs): h′
t=
Aht+Bxt, yt=Cht, where A∈RN×Nis the evolution parameter, and B∈RN×1,C∈RN×1
are the projection parameters. However, the differential equation is hard to solve in the deep learning
setting, thus discrete SSM [55, 44] suggests discretizing the system with a time scale parameter ∆:
¯A=e∆A,¯B= (∆ A)−1(e∆A−I)·∆B,
ht=¯Aht−1+¯Bxt, y t=Cht,(1)
where ¯Aand¯Bare discrete counterparts of the continuous parameters AandB, and ∆∈R>0is
the sampling timescale for the discretization process. Although the discrete SSMs can achieve linear
time complexity, they rely on static parameterization, i.e.,¯A,¯B, and Care time-invariant for any
input, inherently limiting their ability to capture sequence context [ 20]. To address this issue, recently,
[20] proposes Mamba, a selective SSM (S6) that effectively selects relevant context by enabling
dependence of the parameters B∈RL×N,C∈RL×N, and ∆∈RL×Don the input xt∈RL×D:
B=SB(xt), C =SC(xt),∆ = softplus( S∆(xt)). (2)
SB,SC,S∆are linear projection layers and softplus( ·) = log(1 + exp( ·)). The input-dependent
time-variant layers could enhance recurrent layers, making them more expressive and flexible
in capturing complex dependencies [ 21]. The parameter matrixes can be further expressed as
¯A= [¯A1,···,¯AL],¯B= [¯B1,···,¯BL],C= [C1,···, CL], where Lis the sequence length.

3.2 Theoretically Analysis for the Generalization Ability of Mamba
Previous DG methods have primarily focused on enhancing the generalizability of CNNs or ViTs, lack-
ing theoretical investigations into the Mamba model. We theoretically explore the generalization error
bound of Mamba, proving that perturbing the domain-specific features within the input-dependent
matrices of Mamba can effectively diminish the upper bound of the model’s generalization risk .
Notations. Given a training set of Nsource domains DS={D1
S, D2
S,···, DN
S}, the objective of
DG is to use DSto train a model that is expected to perform well on unseen target domain DT. Let
h:X → Y be a hypothesis from the candidate hypothesis space H, where XandYdenote the
input space and the label space, respectively. Since Mamba learns dependencies among tokens from
continuous sequences, we study its generalizability at the token level. Let ψ(·)be the feature extractor
ofhthat maps input images into feature space. Following Integral Probability Metrics [ 57,58], we
define the token-level Maximum Mean Discrepancy to estimate the gap between different domains.
Definition 1 (Token-level Maximum Mean Discrepancy). Given two different distributions of DS
andDT, letLdenote the number of tokens in the response sequence of ψ(·), then we define the
TOken-level Maximum Mean Discrepancy (To-MMD) between ψ(DS)andψ(DT)as:
dTo-MMD (DS, DT) =1
LLX
t=1sup
ψt∈Ψtsup
||f||Fk≤1Z
fd(ψt(DS)−ψt(DT)), (4)
where Ψrepresents the hypothesis space for each token, ψt(D)denotes the distribution of the t-th
token for domain D, andFkis a RKHS with its associated kernel k.
4We here investigate the generalization risk bound of the Mamba model. Theoretically, as in [ 59,60],
the risk of the hypothesis hon the domain Dis defined as: RD(h) =Ex∼D[L(h(x)−h∗(x))], where
L:Y ×Y → R +is a convex loss-function that measures the distance between hand the true labeling
function h∗. Moreover, following [ 8,60], for multiple source domains DS={D1
S, D2
S, ..., DN
S},
the convex hull ΛSis defined as a set of a mixture of source domains, i.e.,ΛS={¯D:¯D(·) =PN
n=1πiDn
s(·),PN
n=1πn= 1, πn∈[0,1]}. The ¯DT∈ΛSis defined as the closest domain to the
target domain DT. Based on Eq. (4), the following generalization risk bound can be derived.
Theorem 1 (Generalization Risk Bound). With the previous setting and assumptions, let Di
Sand
DTbe two sets with Msamples independently drawn from Dn
SandDT, respectively. For any
δ∈(0,1)with probablity of at least 1−δ, for all h∈ H, the following inequality holds:
RDT(h)≤NX
n=1πnRn
DS(h) +dTo-MMD (DT,¯DT) + sup

minimum combined error of the ideal hypothesis h∗on both DSandDT. LetκT=dTo-MMD (DT,¯DT)
andκS= supi,j∈[N]dTo-MMD (Di
S, Dj
S), respectively.
The proof of Theorem 1is provided in Appendix A.1. The inequality indicates that the generalization
error bound depends on κTdenoting the token-level maximum distance between source and target
domains, and κSmeasuring the maximum pairwise gap among source domains at the token level.
The smaller the two terms, the lower the upper bound of generalization error. Following [ 25,58,61],
we simplify the To-MMD in Eq. (4) by choosing a unit ball in the Fkand using Gaussian kernel with
parameter γto estimate κTandκS. Let ¯xS∈RLand¯xT∈RLto denote the mean embeddings of
samples from DSandDT, where Lrepresents the token sequence length. We explore a simplified
problem in conjunction with a single S 6layer, i.e.,¯y=α¯x, with α∈RL×Lbeing the data-dependent
matric. The domain distance between ¯ySand¯yTis formulated as k(¯yS,¯yT) = exp( −||¯yS−¯yT||2/γ),
where γis the kernel parameter. Specifically, for input-dependent matrices B, C, ∆, we denote
softmax( S∆(·))as˜S∆(·). Then, we analyze the impact of these input-dependent matrices on
||¯yS−¯yT||2, which is applicable to both κTandκS. For the i-th tokens ¯xS
iand¯xT
i, we define:
dC˜∆Bx(¯xS
i,¯xT
i) =SC(¯xS
i)˜S∆(¯xS
i)SB(¯xS
i)¯xS
i−SC(¯xT

i)¯xT
i,
d˜∆(¯xS
i,¯xT
i) =˜S∆(¯xS
i)−˜S∆(¯xT
i).(6)
With the recurrent property of the S 6layer in Eq. (3), we can derive the following propositions:
Proposion 1 (Accumulation of Domain Discrepancy). Given two distinct domains DSandDT, the
token-level domain distance dTo-MMD (DS, DT)depends on dC˜∆Bx(¯xS
i,¯xT
i)andd˜∆(¯xS
i,¯xT
i)for the
i-th token. For the entire recurrent process, domain-specific information encoded in S∆,SC, and SB
will accumulate, thereby amplifying domain discrepancy.
Proposion 2 (Mitigating Domain Discrepancy Accumulation). Perturbing domain-specific
features in tokens focused on by S∆,SC, and SBcan enhance their learning of domain-invariant
features, thus effectively mitigating the accumulation issue in these input-dependent matrices.
Propositions 1and2are proved in Appendix A.1. Based on the propositions, we develop a saliency-
driven token augmentation method, which perturbs style information within the tokens that the model
focuses on at the sequence level. In this way, our method enhances the extraction of domain-invariant
features by the input-dependent matrices, i.e.,S∆,SC, and SB. As presented in Tab. 6, we also
empirically validate the effectiveness of our method in reducing domain discrepancy in these matrices.
3.3 Saliency-driven Token-Aware Transformation for Mamba
To boost the generalization ability of the Mamba model, leveraging the Proposion 1 andProposion 2 ,
we propose a novel Saliency-driven Token-AwaRe Transformation paradigm (START in short), which
aims to explicitly suppress domain-related features within the input-dependent matrixes. Unlike
prior methods that perturb entire feature maps at the channel level [ 13–15], START incorporates a

framework is the Saliency-driven Token-Aware Transformation, which uses a saliency-driven scheme
to localize tokens targeted by input-dependent matrices, subsequently perturbing domain-specific style
information within these tokens. We designed two variants: START-M, which uses input-dependent
matrices, and START-X, which uses input sequences to compute saliency.
saliency-driven token selection scheme to perturb the prominent regions of input-dependent matrics
S∆,SB, and SC. Based on the attention mechanism outlined in Eq. (3), we propose two variants
to identify and perturb tokens within salient regions, including START-M that determines saliency
using input-dependent matrices, and START-X computing saliency based on input sequences.
START based on input-dependent matrices (START-M). AsProposition 1 reveals, for the i-th
token, the token-level domain gap depends on dC˜∆Bx(¯xS
i,¯xT
i)andd˜∆(¯xS
i,¯xT
i). Specifically, as
presented in Eq. (6), dC˜∆Bxis contingent on SC(xi)˜S∆(xi)SB(xi)xi, which is the response of the
SSM to xi.SC(xi)˜S∆(xi)SB(xi)could be regarded as a self-attention matrix, which implicitly
offers a measure of saliency for a token xi. To this end, we propose START-M, which utilizes the
input-dependent matrices to identify salient tokens. Concretely, given an input sequence {xi}L
i=1,
where Ldenotes the sequence length, we first compute the input-dependent matrices based on Eq. (2).
Then, we calculate the saliency value for each token based on Eq. (6), i.e., for the i-th token xi:
Saliency M(xi) =SC(xi)softmax( S∆(xi))SB(xi)xi, (7)
Afterward, we generate a binary mask MS∈BLwith the element being set to 1if the corresponding
element Saliency M(xi)is in the top Ptokens percentage elements.
Meanwhile, we synthesize the style-augmented sequence, which is achieved by mixing the mean
and variance of different samples. Following [ 13,62], we first compute the style statistics as:
µ(x) =1
LPL
i=1xi, σ(x) =q
1
LPL
i=1(xi−µ(x))2. Then we randomly select another sample x′
from the current batch, utilizing its statistics to synthesize the stylized version of x:
˜µ=ϵµ(x) + (1 −ϵ)µ(x′),˜σ=ϵσ(x) + (1 −ϵ)σ(x′),
ϵ∼Beta (0.1,0.1),˜x=x−µ(x)
σ(x)·˜µ+ ˜σ,(8)
Finally, with the token-level mask MS, we mix xand˜xto generate the augmented sequence xaug,
where tokens with maximum saliency are style-augmented, while other tokens remain unchanged:
xaug=MS⊙x+ (1− M S)⊙˜x, (9)
where ⊙is element-wise multiplication. Note that when Ptoken = 1, START-M degenerates into a
channel-level augmentation, i.e., MixStyle [ 13]. However, note that style statistics could be one kind

of domain-specific feature, while other forms of domain-specific features may also exist, especially
within the image backgrounds [ 59,63]. As a result, directly perturbing the style information of tokens
on the background might activate other forms of domain-related noise, which could still disrupt the
model generalization [ 64]. To address this issue, our START-M proposes to selectively perturb tokens
with the highest saliency, which are typically associated with foregrounds, thus enhancing the model
learning of domain-invariant information without activating domain-related noise. Ablation study in
Section 4.3 also proves the effectiveness of the saliency-driven selection scheme.
START based on input sequences (START-X). Based on Proposition 2 , recalling that ∆,B, and
Care all input-dependent matrices (as in Eq. (2)), we design a simplified variant, namely START-
X, which involves using the activation values of xto approximate the saliency of tokens directly.
Specifically, for the i-th input token xi, we directly compute its saliency value as: Saliency X(xi) =
xi. With the saliency for each token, we compute the token-level binary mask MSas that of START-
X and employ Eq. (9) to generate the augmented sequences. In practice, we randomly apply our
START method to 50% of the samples in each batch, leaving the remaining samples unperturbed
during each training iteration. Our START method is disabled during inference.
In summary, we theoretically investigate the generalization error boundary of Mamba at the token
level, highlighting that suppressing domain-related information within input-dependent matrices can
effectively reduce the generalization error boundary of the model. Based on the theoretical analysis,
we propose the first saliency-driven token-aware transformation for SSMs, designing two different
variants for identifying and perturbing the tokens focused on by the input-dependent matrices B, C, ∆.
In this way, our method can effectively enhance the reliance of the input-dependent matrices on
domain-invariant features and narrow the distance between source and target domains. Notably, our
START introduces no additional parameters or inference time, only involving a few matrix operations
during training, thus achieving similar linear complexity to VMamba as presented in Appendix A.2.

animals taken by 4camera-trap domains, with 10classes and a total of 24,788images. DomainNet
[5] is large-scale with 586,575images, having 345classes from 6domains, i.e., Clipart, Infograph,
Painting, Quickdraw, Real, and Sketch. Results on DomainNet are reported in Appendix A.2.
Implementation details. We closely follow the implementation of VMamba [ 22] and use the
VMamba-T, which has similar parameters with ResNet- 50(22M vs. 23M), as the backbone. The
backbone is pretrained on the ImageNet [ 82] for all our experiments. We partition the input image
into4×4patches without further flattening the patches into a 1D sequence. The network depth
of the VMamba-T backbone is 4the same as ResNet- 50, consisting of 2,2,9, and 2VSS layers,
respectively. The embedding dimensions of blocks in the 4stages are fixed as [96,192,384,768].
Following existing DG methods [ 15,83], we train the model for 50epochs using AdamW optimizer
and cosine decay schedule, with a batch size of 64, the initial learning rate as 5e−4, and the
momentum of 0.9. For all experiments, we the ratio Ptoken of augmented tokens to 0.75. We apply
the leave-one-domain-out protocol for all benchmarks, where one domain is used for testing, and the
remaining domains are employed for training. We select the last-epoch model and report the average
accuracy over five runs. All the experiments are run on 4NVIDIA Teska V100 GPUs.
4.2 Main Results
Evaluation on PACS. We first compare our method with SOTA CNN-based DG methods on
ResNet- 50. As shown in Tab. 1, the strong baseline (VMamba) achieves a promising performance,
exceeding ResNet- 50by4.44% (89.94% vs.85.50%), which indicates its superiority for DG.
Moreover, we apply our START to the strong baseline and build advanced models, which can achieve
significant improvements without introducing extra parameters. Notably, START-M achieves the
SOTA performance, improving baseline by 1.83% (91.77% vs.89.94%) and yielding the latest
CNN-based DG method GMDG [ 75] by6.17% (91.77% vs.85.60%). START-X can also improve
the baseline significantly by 1.78% (91.72% vs.89.94%). Compared with SOTA ViT-based methods,
START-M still performs excellent, yielding GMoE-S [ 19] by5.07% (91.77% vs.86.70%) with small
network sizes ( 22M vs. 34M). Finally, our methods beat the recent DGMamba [ 54], exceeding it by
0.57% (91.77% vs.91.20%) on average, which proves the effectiveness of our method for DG.
Evaluation on OfficeHome. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on OfficeHome and present
the results in Tab. 1. Our methods achieve significant improvements compared with CNN-based
methods, e.g., START-M outperforms the SOTA method EoA [ 67] by4.59% (77.09% vs.72.50%)
on ResNet- 50. Based on the Strong Baseline with high performance, our method can still improve it
by0.66% (77.09% vs.76.43%). START-M precedes the best MLP-like model ViP-S [ 78], which
learns long-range dependencies along height and weight directions, with a large improvement of
4.71% (77.09% vs.73.38%). The results justify the superiority of START.
Evaluation on VLCS. As presented in Tab. 2, our START achieves the best performance among all
competitors, surpassing the top CNN-based method SAGM [ 69] by1.32% (81.32% vs.80.00%).
8Additionally, our method significantly improves upon the baseline, outperforming the latest Mamba-
based method DGMamba by 0.52% (81.32% vs.80.80%).
Evaluation on TerraIncognita. As shown in Tab. 2, We observe that the VMamba baseline
significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving a SOTA performance of 56.16%. Based on
the strong baseline, our method can further achieve substantial improvement by 2.11% (58.27% vs.
56.16%), proving that our method effectively suppresses domain-specific features learned by Mamba.
4.3 Ablation Study and Analytical Experiments
Ablation study. We here validate the effectiveness of each operation in START. Specifically, w/o
Saliency Guided denotes random selection of tokens for perturbation within input sequences, while
w/o Token Selection means perturbing the entire input sequences. Tab. 3 presents the results using
VMamba backbone on PACS. Both variants show improvements over the baseline, indicating that
perturbing style information can mitigate overfitting issues. However, as discussed in Section 3.3,

of domain-specific features, potentially
hindering model generalization.

to the hyper-parameter Ptoken , the percentage of perturbed tokens
in input sequences. As shown in Fig. 3, START-M consistently
performs well across different Ptoken values, demonstrating its
effectiveness in perturbing domain-specific information in salient
tokens. We notice that START-X, which uses token activation
to approximate saliency, performs similarly to START-M when
Ptoken is high but is less effective at lower Ptoken values. This
indicates differences between attention regions of input-dependent
matrices and input sequences. Both methods achieve the highest
accuracy at Ptoken = 0.75, which is adopted for all experiments.

tion Matrix” methods. For the “Grad-
CAM” method, we first obtain feature
gradients using backpropagation without
updating, then compute token saliency
and augment salient tokens at each itera-
tion. For the “Attention Matrix” method,
since the Mamba architecture lacks explicit attention matrices, we instead use αin Eq. (3) to calculate
token saliency. As shown in Tab. 4, on the strong baseline, START still performs much better than
these advanced methods, exceeding “GradCAM” by 0.91% (91.77% vs.90.86%) and “Attention
Matrix” by 1.00% (91.77% vs.90.77%). It is owing to the ability of START to explicitly suppress
domain-specific features within input-dependent matrixes.

[15]. As shown in Tab. 5, all the aug-
mentation methods bring performance
improvements, indicating that increasing
data diversity is beneficial for the gen-
eralization ability of Mamba. Notably,
START outperforms all the SOTA augmentation methods, i.e., yielding a significant margin of 1.06%
9(91.77% vs.91.72%) from DSU. The results prove the effectiveness of our methods in perturbing
domain-specific features within input-dependent matrices.

trices. To verify the effectiveness of our
method in reducing domain gaps within
input-dependent matrices, we compare
domain gaps across different methods
using PACS with VMamba. The ex-
periments focus on the last block of
VMamba, examining the output feature
maps (“Feat.”) and the input-dependent
matrices ˜∆,B, and Cof the first SS2D. The results in Tab. 6 align well with theoretical analysis in
Section 3.2, proving that START effectively reduces domain gaps in the input-dependent matrices.
5 Conclusions
In this paper, inspired by the success of Mamba in supervised tasks, we theoretically study the
generalizability of Mamba and find that the input-dependent matrices in Mamba could accumulate
and amplify domain-specific features during training. To address the issue, we propose a generalized
state space model with a saliency-driven token-aware transformation for DG, which can selectively
augment domain-specific features within salient tokens focused on by the input-dependent matrices,
thus helping the model learn domain-invariant features. Our method outperforms SOTA CNN-based
and ViT-based methods by a significant margin with linear complexity and a small-sized network. We
hope our work inspires further research in DG and contributes valuable insights to the community.

A.1 Theoretical Proofs
Lemma 1 [ 58].LetF={f∈ H k:||f||Hk≤1}denote a function class, where Hkbe a
RKHS with its associated kernel k. LetLh,f:x→ L[h(x), f(x)]be a convex loss-function with
a parameter form |h(x)−f(x)|qfor some q >0, and defined ∀h, f∈ F,Lobeys the triangle
inequality. Let SandTbe two samples of size Mdrawn i.i.d from DSandDT, respectively. Then,
with probability of at least 1−δ(δ∈(0,1)) for all h∈ F, the following holds:

hypothesis h∗onDSandDT.
Theorem 1 (Generalization risk bound). With the previous setting and assumptions, let Di
SandDT
be two sets with Msamples independently drawn from Dn
SandDT, respectively. For any δ∈(0,1)
with probablity of at least 1−δ, for all h∈ H, the following inequality holds:
RDT(h)≤NX
n=1πnRn
DS(h) +dTo-MMD (DT,¯DT) + sup

minimum combined error of the ideal hypothesis h∗on both DSandDT. LetγT=dTo-MMD (DT,¯DT)
andγS= supi,j∈[N]dTo-MMD (Di
S, Dj
S), respectively.
Proof. We initially investigate the relationship between the MMD [ 58] and To-MMD distances based
onDefinition 1 (as presented in Eq. (4)). With the feature extractor ψ(·), we have:
dMMD(DS, DT) = sup

=dTo-MMD (DS, DT).(12)
Then, for a pair of source domain Dn
SandDT, the following inequality holds:
dTo-MMD (Dn
S, DT)≤dTo-MMD (Dn
S,¯DT) +dTo-MMD (¯DT, DT), (13)
with which we can derive the weighted sum of To-MMD between source domains and target domain:
NX
n=1πndTo-MMD (Dn
S, DT)≤NX
n=1πndTo-MMD (Dn
S,¯DT) +dTo-MMD (¯DT, DT)
≤sup
i,j∈[N]dTo-MMD (Di
S, Dj
S) +dTo-MMD (¯DT, DT).(14)
With the above preparations, we now derive the generalization error bound of the Mamba model on
the unseen target domain. Recalling that Lemma 1 indicates the generalization error bound between
two different distributions, we generalize it to the scenario of multiple source domains:

2Mandσis the
minimum combined error of the ideal hypothesis h∗on both DSandDT.
Proposion 1 (Accumulation of Domain Discrepancy). Given two distinct domains DSandDT, the
token-level domain distance dTo-MMD (DS, DT)depends on dC˜∆Bx(¯xS
i,¯xT
i)andd˜∆(¯xS
i,¯xT
i)for the
i-th token. For the entire recurrent process, domain-specific information encoded in S∆,SC, and SB
will accumulate, thereby amplifying domain discrepancy.
Proof. For simplification, we use ¯xS∈RLand¯xT∈RLto denote the sample mean embeddings
for the DSandDT, respectively. Lrepresents the token sequence length. To investigate the
generalization error boundary of Mamba, we explore a simplified problem in conjunction with a
single S 6layer, i.e.,¯y=α¯x, where α∈RL×Lis the data-dependent matric. Empirically, based on
Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), we estimate the token-level domain gap using Euclidean distance of ¯ySand¯yS,
||¯yS−¯yT||2=vuutLX

iX
j=1(αs
i,j¯xs
j−αt

j)
2
(16)
Combined with Eq. (2) and Eq. (3), we represent αas a direct function of the input ¯x:
αi,j=SC(¯xi)
exp(iX
k=j+1softmax( S∆(¯xk))A)
softmax( S∆(¯xj))SB(¯xj) (17)
Since the SSM layer calculates yibased on the continuous subsequence [¯x1,¯x2,···,¯xi], we here
analyze the domain gap of the extracted features at the token level, i.e.,|yS
i−yT
i|. Specifically,
assuming that we have calculated |yS
i−yT
i|=β(1≤i < L ), from Eq. (16), we can derive:
|yS
i+1−yT
i+1| − |yS
i−yT
i|=|i+1X
j=1(αS
i+1,j¯xS

i,j)¯xT
j] + (αS
i+1,i+1¯xS
i+1−αT
i+1,i+1¯xT
i+1)|(18)
With the defined αin Eq. (17) and denoting softmax( S∆(·))as˜S∆(·)for brevity, we can express:
αi+1,j−αi,j=SC(¯xi+1)
exp(i+1X
k=j+1˜S∆(¯xi+1)A)
˜S∆(¯xj)SB(¯xj)
−SC(¯xi)
exp(iX
k=j+1˜S∆(¯xi)A)
˜S∆(¯xj)SB(¯xj)
=[SC(¯xi+1)
SC(¯xi)exp(˜S∆(¯xi+1)A)−1]·αi,j(19)
16Considering that the differences between adjacent tokens are generally small, SC(¯xi+1)/SC(¯xi)
could be approximated to 1. When the dimension of ¯xis relatively large, then for Eq. (19), we have:
αi+1,j−αi,j≈˜S∆(¯xi+1)A·αi,j (20)
Then, we substitute Eq. (20) into Eq. (18) to derive the following formula:
|yS
i+1−yT
i+1| − |yS
i−yT
i|
=|iX

Finally, recalling that |yS
i−yT
i|=β, we can express |yS
i+1−yT
i+1|as following:
|yS
i+1−yT
i+1|=|

i+1,
andd˜∆(¯xS
i+1,¯xT
i+1) =˜S∆(¯xS
i+1)−˜S∆(¯xT
i+1). Then, the above equation reveals that for the input
tokens ¯xS
i+1and¯xT
i+1,the distance between their extracted features, alongside the gap of historical
sequences, primarily depends on dC˜∆Bx(¯xS
i+1,¯xT
i+1)andd˜∆(¯xS
i+1,¯xT
i+1).Besides, the recurrent
process in Eq. (22) could also lead to the accumulation or even enhancement of domain-specific
information, i.e., if the model extracts domain-related information from the ith token, this part of the
information will be retained in the features extracted by the (i+ 1) -th token. For the whole recurrent
process, domain-related information encoded in S∆,SC, and SBwill be accumulated and amplified,
which will increase the discrepancy in the features extracted by the model for different domains, thus
damaging its generalization ability. Therefore, to reduce the domain gap, it is imperative to suppress
domain-specific information learned by S∆,SC, and SB.
Proposion 2 (Mitigating Domain Discrepancy Accumulation). Perturbing domain-specific
features in tokens focused on by S∆,SC, and SBcan enhance their learning of domain-invariant
features, thus effectively mitigating the accumulation issue in these input-dependent matrices.
Proof. Recalling that in the Mamba mode, S∆,SC, and SBare all linear projection layers, which
map the input sequence ¯x∈RLto the data-dependent matrixes ∆,C, andB, respectively. Hence, we
analyze the influence of tokens in xon these matrixes. Taking the matric Bas an example, we explore
the simplified problem with SB(x) =WB¯x, where WB∈RL×NandNdenotes the dimension of
the hinder state. Inspired by previous works [84, 85], we assume that the input sequence ¯xcould be
decomposed to domain-specific features ¯xIanddomain-specific features ¯xS. Then, for the i-th token
¯xiin¯x, the projection matric Bcould be denoted as:
Bi=SB(¯xi) =WBi¯xi= [WI
Bi¯xI
i, WS
Bi¯xS
i] (23)
Previous theoretical works [ 84,86] have demonstrated that when a subset of features is perturbed, its
variance would be increased, and the model would be regularized to decrease the weights associated
with these features to minimize the prediction loss. Therefore, by perturbing the domain-specific
features xS
i, its corresponding weights WS
Biwould be restricted to 0. Simultaneously, due to minimal
changes in the domain-invariant feature xI
i, the learning of its corresponding weights WI
Biis promoted,
thus enhancing SBlearning of domain-invariant features.
Furthermore, given the presence of foreground and background in images [ 54], different tokens
contain varied information. Foreground tokens primarily encode domain-invariant semantic features

alongside some domain-specific details. Perturbing the domain-related features in these tokens can
effectively enhance the model’s learning of domain-invariant features. Conversely, background
tokens encompass diverse domain-related spurious features that are challenging to fully extract and
perturb. As a result, perturbing a subset of domain-related features in these tokens may inadvertently
activate other forms of spurious noise, thereby hindering model generalization. To address this issue,
leveraging the hidden attention mechanism of Mamba (as depicted in Eq. (3)), where tokens with
high saliency are more likely to belong to the foreground, we propose to perturb domain-specific
information solely in the tokens focused on by the input-dependent matrices.
A.2 Additional Experiments
Evaluation on DomainNet. We investigate the effectiveness of our method on the large-scale dataset
DomainNet. As shown in Tab. 7, on the challenging benchmark, we find that the strong baseline
VMamba can achieve the promising performance of 51.45%, proving the superiority of Mamba
models on large-scale datasets. Based on the strong baseline, our START can still significantly
improve the performance, exceeding the baseline by 1.35% (52.81% vs51.45%). Besides, compared
with CNN-based methods, our method can still achieve significant improvements, e.g., outperforming
the latest SOTA method AGFA [ 74] by5.71% (52.81% vs47.10%). Our methods also beat the best
ViT-based method DoPrompt [ 17], yielding it by a large margin of 4.51% (52.81% vs48.30%). The
results prove the effectiveness of our method to help the model learn domain-invariant representation.
Ablation studies on larger datasets. We provide the ablation studies on the Officehome and
TerraIncognita datasets. As shown in Tab. 8, our methods perform the best among all variants, e.g.,
on TerraIncognita, our START-X outperforms the variant “ w.o. Saliency Guided” by 0.97% (58.27%
vs.57.30%) and the variant “ w.o. Token Selection” by 0.83% (58.27% vs.57.44%). The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of all modules in our START methods.
Effects on other Mamba-based architectures. To validate the effectiveness of our START on
other Mamba architectures, we conducted experiments on the recent ViM [ 23], using the ViM-T and
ViM-S models with different network sizes. The experiments were performed on the PACS dataset
with an initial learning rate of 6.25e−6and a weight decay of 1e−8. As shown in Tab. 9, our
method consistently improves performance across the models with different scales, e.g., on ViM-S,
START-X outperformed the baseline by 2.03% (89.41% vs.87.38%), and on ViM-T, START-X
exceeded the baseline by 1.66% (86.74% vs.85.08%). These results demonstrate the generalizability
of our method across different Mamba architectures.
Effects on the ViT architecture. Recalling that our method is derived from the theoretical analysis
that input-dependent matrices in Mamba could accumulate domain-related information during training,

our START aims to improve the generalization of the Mamba architecture. Nevertheless, the core
concept, adaptively perturbing salient tokens in input-dependent matrices, is also applicable to ViTs.
Considering that in ViTs, the attention matrix uses query Qand key K, and then multiplied by the
original feature Vto obtain the final representation. We develop our START-M to START-ViT-M,
which calculates token saliency from the input-dependent matrices ( i.e.,Q×KT), and START-X
to START-ViT-X, which uses the activation value of representation xto approximate saliency. The
experiments are conducted on the representative ViT architecture, i.e., DeiT-Small, with the PACS
dataset. As shown in Tab.10, 1) on the DeiT-Small baseline, our START re-designed for ViTs still
can effectively improve the Baseline by a significant margin, e.g., START-ViT-M outperforms the
baseline by 1.20% (87.05% vs.85.85%). The results prove the effectiveness of our START’s variants
on ViTs; 2) we notice that the VMamba-T ( 22Mparameters) is a stronger baseline model than the
DeiT-Small ( 22Mparameters), exceeding it by a large margin of 4.09% (89.94% vs.85.85%). The
results also reveal the advantage of Mamba architecture to learn domain-invariant token dependencies
in compressed state space, and our START can further enhance the generalization ability of Mamba.
Evaluation on single-source domain generalization tasks. We here evaluate our method under
the single-source-domain generalization setting. As shown in Tab. 11, START-M significantly
improves the baseline, outperforming it by 2.12% (71.64% vs.69.52%). These results prove that our
method enhances model generalization by simulating domain shifts through salience-driven token
transformation, improving performance in both multi-source and single-source DG tasks.

Effectiveness with other SOTA augmentation methods. In our method, we utilize a statistics-based
style augmentation method to perturb domain-specific information within tokens. We also explore
other SOTA DG augmentation methods for comparison, including the DSU [ 14] that models the
distribution of statistics across different samples and resample new statistics from the distribution, and
the ALOFT [ 15] that diversifies the low-frequency spectrum in the frequency domain. These methods
primarily perturb style information at the channel level. As shown in Tab. 12, our method significantly
improves the performance of the SOTA augmentation methods on the VMamba baseline, e.g., our
START-DSU-M achieves a significant improvement over DSU by 0.8%(91.63% vs.90.71%),
exceeding the baseline by 1.69% (91.63% vs.89.94%). The above results prove that selective
perturbation of domain-specific features in salient tokens is crucial for enhancing the generalization
capability of Mamba models.
Effects across different stages. Our theoretical analysis examined how domain gaps accumulate
within each SSM layer. Since one layer’s output serves as the next layer’s input, domain-specific
features from earlier stages increase domain gaps in later stages. To address the issue, we applied
START to all layers to reduce domain gaps comprehensively. We also tested START separately in
either shallow or deep layers. As shown in Tab. 13, using START in both shallow and deep layers
simultaneously performs best, aligning with our theoretical analysis. Applying START-M or START-
X randomly across layers also improves performance, though less effectively than using START-M
or START-X alone. This may be because START-M and START-X target different domain-related
information, leading to incomplete suppression when mixed.
Computational efficiency. To evaluate the computational efficiency of our proposed START, we
conduct experiments on the PACS dataset and compare our method with existing CNN-based and
ViT-based methods. Specifically, we compare the number of parameters, floating point operations per
second (FLOPs), the inference times, and the generalization performance of each method. The batch
size for evaluating inference time is set to 64, and the inference time is averaged over 100experiments.
Since STARR-M and START-X are only activated during training and disabled during inference, they
introduce no additional inference time. As shown in Tab. 14, our method has significantly fewer
FLOPs than ResNet- 50(5.68 vs. 8.26) while outperforming the DeepAll on ResNet- 50(the baseline
that directly trains the model on source domains) by 6.22% (91.77% vs.85.50%), demonstrating the
superiority of our START.
Visualization explanations. To provide visual evidence of the effectiveness of our START in
suppressing domain-specific features, we use GradCAM [ 89] to generate attention maps of the last
state space layer for both the baseline (pure VMamba) and our START models. As illustrated in Fig. 4,

Figure 4: Visualization results of our START. The experiments are conducted on the PACS dataset
with the “Art” as the target domain. We visualize the attention maps of the last layer in the VMamba
backbone. For each sample, the first column is the original image, the second column is the attention
map of the baseline ( i.e., VMamba), and the third and last columns are the attention maps of our
START-X and START-M, respectively. Our methods help the model learn more domain-invariant
semantic features, e.g., holistic shape structure, than the pure VMamba baseline.
the VMamba baseline tends to focus on specific local patches that encode domain-specific features,
leading to overfitting to source domains. In contrast, our START methods effectively reduce the
model’s focus on domain-specific features, enabling it to capture generalizable global dependencies
of tokens. For instance, in the case of the person image in the Art domain, the baseline focuses on
multiple local regions in both the foreground and the background, making the model sensitive to
domain shifts and likely to misclassify samples. Conversely, our START models mainly focus on the
foreground, specifically the whole face of the person. The results prove the effectiveness of START
in learning comprehensive domain-invariant features, making it a promising method for DG tasks.
Difference from the related work. In essence, our method significantly differs from DGMamba [ 54]
in their motivations, goals and methods. 1) Different Motivations : DGMamba observes that hidden
states could amplify domain-related information, and proposes a heuristic method to address the
issue. However, it lacks a deep analysis of the phenomenon. Differently, we first theoretically delve
into the generalizability of Mamba, revealing how input-dependent matrices contribute to domain
gap accumulation. Based on the analysis, we developed START to enhance Mamba’s generalization.
2)Different Goals and Methods : DGMamba aims to enforce the model to focus on object tokens,
perturbing object tokens while replacing context tokens. It ignores that object tokens could be
misclassified as context tokens, replacing which would hinder the model from learning semantics.
Inversely, START aims to suppress domain-specific information in tokens focused on input-dependent
21matrixes, perturbing only styles while keeping contents unchanged. Notably, DGMamba uses
the GradCAM [ 89] for context patch identification, requiring two backpropagations per iteration.
Conversely, our START uses input-dependent matrixes to calculate token saliency during forward
propagation, needing only one backpropagation and thus reducing training time.
A.3 Broader Impact
Our work aims to enhance model generalization and computational efficiency, enabling robust
performance across diverse domains with varying distributions. By mitigating the overfitting issue
on limited source domains and improving performance on unseen target domains, we believe it will
have a positive societal impact.
A.4 Limitations of Our Work
In the paper, we employ style perturbation to perturb domain-specific information within salient
tokens of input sequences. However, there are various forms of domain-specific information in
the images, which could not be completely suppressed by our method. To address this issue, a
potential solution is to design advanced feature disentanglement methods that adaptively distinguish
and perturb domain-specific information. Designing class-aware feature augmentation could also
alleviate the accumulation of domain-related features. We will explore these solutions in future work.

1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification:
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Appendix A.4.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
22•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper has stated the full set of assumptions and provided complete proofs
in Section 3.2 and Appendix A.1.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See in Section 4.1.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
23•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental

•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:

•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See in Section 4.1.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental

7.Experiment Statistical Significance
24Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification:
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification:
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
25Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See in Appendix A.3.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: The paper does not release the data or models with a high risk for misuse.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper uses five public datasets, including PACS [ 24], OfficeHome [ 79],
VLCS [ 80], TerraIncognita [ 81], and DomainNet [ 5]. See the licenses in the original pepers.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
26• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
27•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
