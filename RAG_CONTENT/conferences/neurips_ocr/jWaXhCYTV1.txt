Abstract
We consider the linear causal representation learning setting where we observe a
linear mixing of dunknown latent factors, which follow a linear structural causal
model. Recent work has shown that it is possible to recover the latent factors as well
as the underlying structural causal model over them, up to permutation and scaling,
provided that we have at least denvironments, each of which corresponds to perfect
interventions on a single latent node (factor). After this powerful result, a key open
problem faced by the community has been to relax these conditions: allow for
coarser than perfect single-node interventions, and allow for fewer than dof them,
since the number of latent factors dcould be very large. In this work, we consider
precisely such a setting, where we allow a smaller than dnumber of environments,
and also allow for very coarse interventions that can very coarsely change the
entire causal graph over the latent factors . On the flip side, we relax what we
wish to extract to simply the list of nodes that have shifted between one or more
environments . We provide a surprising identifiability result that it is indeed possible,
under some very mild standard assumptions, to identify the set of shifted nodes. Our
identifiability proof moreover is a constructive one: we explicitly provide necessary
and sufficient conditions for a node to be a shifted node, and show that we can check
these conditions given observed data. Our algorithm lends itself very naturally to
the sample setting where instead of just interventional distributions, we are provided
datasets of samples from each of these distributions. We corroborate our results
on both synthetic experiments as well as an interesting psychometric dataset. The

1 Introduction
The objective of learning disentangled representations is to separate the different factors that contribute
to the variation in the observed data, resulting in a representation that is easier to understand and
manipulate [ 3]. Traditional methods for disentanglement [e.g., 19,20,7,9,26] aim to make the
latent variables independent of each other.
Consider the setting of linear independent component analysis (ICA) [ 19], that is, the observed
variables X∈Rpare generated through the process X=GZ, where Z∈Rdarelatent factors,
andG∈Rp×dis an unknown “mixing” matrix. Under the key assumption that Zhas statistically
independent components, and under some additional mild assumptions, landmark results in linear
ICA show that it is possible to recover the latent variables Zup to permutation and scaling [13, 19].

38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).However, what if instead of independent sources Zwe have a structural causal model (SCM, [ 37,38])
over them? For instance, if the latent factors correspond to biomarkers in a biology context, or root
causes in a root cause analysis context, then we expect there to be rich associations between them.
Indeed, this question is central in the burgeoning field of causal representation learning (CRL)
[39,51], where we are interested in extracting the latent factors and causal associations between them
given raw data.
Let us look at the simplest CRL setting where the latent variables Zfollow a linear SCM, that is,
Z=AZ+ Ω1/2ϵ, where A∈Rd×dencodes a directed acyclic graph (DAG), Ωis a diagonal matrix
that controls the scale of noise variances, and ϵis some noise vector with zero-mean and unit-variance
independent components. In such a case, Zis a linear mixing of independent components ϵ, that is,
Z=B−1ϵ, where B= Ω−1/2(Id−A)succinctly encodes the SCM and Idis the identity matrix of
dimension Rd×d. We then have X=GB−1ϵso that ICA can only recover BG†up to permutation
and scaling, which does not suffice to recover the SCM Bsince the mixing function Gis unknown.
Recently, Seigal et al. [40] showed that given the interventional distributions arising from perfect
interventions oneach latent variable in Z, we can recover the SCM over Zup to permutation. But
there are two caveats to this: (a) it is difficult to obtain perfect single-node interventions that only
intervene on a single factor in Z; and (b) it is difficult to obtain dnumber of such perfect interventional
distributions or environments.
We are interested in the setting where we do not have perfect interventions: we allow for far more
general interventions that can quite coarsely change the SCM, namely, softandhard interventions,
interventions targeting single ormultiple nodes, as well as interventions capable of adding orremoving
parent nodes and reversing edges. Moreover, we do not need as many as dof these.
Our goal, however, is not to recover the entire SCM over Zbut simply to recover those nodes Zthat
have incurred shifts or changes between the different interventional distributions. This is closely
related to root cause analysis [ 5,6,21,33], which aims to identify the origins of the observed changes
in a joint distribution. In addition, understanding the sources of distribution shifts—that is, localizing
invariant/shifted conditional distributions—can benefit downstream tasks such as domain adaptation
[30], and domain generalization [36, 55].
Contributions. Our work sits at the intersection of linear CRL [ 40,23] and direct estimation of
causal mechanism shifts [ 52,14]. The key contribution of this work is to show that it is possible to
identify the latent sources of distribution shifts in multiple datasets while bypassing the estimation
of the mixing function Gand the SCM Bover the latent variables, under very general types of
interventions. More concretely, we make the following set of contributions:
1.Identifiability: We show that we can identify the shifted latent factors even under more
general types of interventions. (Section 4.1).
2.Algorithm: We also provide an scalable algorithm that implements our identifiability result
to infer such shifted latent factors even in the practical scenarios where we are not given the
entire coarse interventional distributions but merely finite samples from each (Section 4.2).
3.Experiments: We corroborate our results on both synthetic experiments (Section 5.1) as
well as an interesting psychometric dataset (Section 5.2).
2 Related Work
Causal representation learning. In contrast to our setting, which focuses on identifying shifted
nodes in the latent representation, existing methods in CRL aim to recover both the latent causal
graph and the mixing function. Previous works have studied identifiability in various settings, such
as latent linear SEMs with linear mixing [ 40], and with nonlinear mixing [ 4]; latent nonlinear
SEMs with finite degree polynomial mixing [ 1], and with linear mixing [ 48]; and nonlinear SEMs
with nonlinear mixing [ 50,49,23,22]. Although these studies ensure the identifiability of causal
graphs (up to permutation and scaling ambiguities), they generally rely on the assumption that
each latent variable is intervened upon in at least one environment, necessitating access to at
leastdinterventional distributions. Moreover, the aforementioned works assume specific types of
interventions, such as hard/soft interventions and single-node interventions, and restrict changes
in interventional distributions, disallowing edge reversals or the addition of new edges. The most
2recent work [ 23] enables causal representation learning under general interventions in latent linear
SEMs with linear mixing. However, this approach still requires the assumption that the number
of environments Kis at least equal to the number of latent nodes dand that there are at least
Θ(d2)interventions. If the objective is to detect variables with general mechanism changes across
multiple environments—environments that may lack a consistent topological order and sufficient
interventions or environments—using existing CRL methods to recover each latent graph becomes
overly restrictive or even infeasible. In contrast, we present a more flexible approach, enabling the
identification of shifted variables without assuming restrictive interventions per environment or a
consistent topological order of the latent graphs.
Direct estimation of mechanism shifts. The problem of directly estimating causal mechanism
changes without estimating the causal graphs has also been explored in various settings in the regime
in which the causal variables are observable. Wang et al. [52] and Ghoshal et al. [14] have focused
on identifying structural differences, assuming linear SEMs as environments, and proposing methods
that take advantage of variations in the precision matrices. More recently, Chen et al. [10] studied
this problem for nonlinear additive noise models, assuming that the environments originate from
soft/hard interventions and leverage recent work in causal discovery via score matching. Finally,
the concept of detecting/localizing feature shifts between two distributions has also been discussed
in [27], although from a non-causal perspective. To our knowledge, there is a gap in the literature
regarding the study of these objectives when considering latent causal variables. We address this gap
by proposing a novel approach for directly detecting mechanism shifts within the latent SCMs.
Independent component analysis. The application of independent component analysis (ICA) [ 12]
in the realm of causal discovery has seen significant developments. Linear ICA [ 19] and its nonlinear
counterpart [ 20] have been instrumental in causal discovery [ 35,44,53] and more recently in causal
latent discovery [ 23]. Beyond these established applications, our work uncovers a novel use of ICA,
namely, identifying shifted nodes within the latent linear SCMs.
Given the relevance of ICA for our approach, we briefly recap it next. ICA considers the following
setting: X=Wϵwhere X∈Rp,ϵ∈Rd,p≥d. A key assumption in ICA is that each component
ofϵis independent. Given only observations of X, the goal of ICA is to estimate both Wandϵ. The
objective function typically aims to maximize negentropy or non-Gaussianity, with further details
given in [19]. The identifiability results of ICA can be summarized as follows.
Theorem 1 (Theorems 3,4 in [ 13]).If every component of ϵis independent and at most one component
is Gaussian distributed, with Wbeing full column rank, then ICA can estimate Wup to a permutation
and scaling of each column, and ϵcan be recovered for some permutation up to scaling for each
component. Furthermore, as noted in [ 19], ifE[ϵ2
i] = 1,∀i∈[d], the estimated Wandϵwill have
ambiguities only in permutation and sign. Formally, this means
X=Wϵ= (WPTD)(DPϵ),
where Pis a permutation matrix and Dis a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries ±1. Then, the
best estimate given by ICA is WPTDandDPϵ .
3 Problem Setting
Consider a random vector XinRpthat is a linear mixing of dlatent variables Z= (Z1, . . . , Z d):
X=GZ.
Here the latent variables in Zfollows a linear SCM [37, 38], that is,
Z=AZ+ Ω1/2ϵ
where A∈Rd×dcorresponds to a DAG Gsuch that Ajk̸= 0 iff there exists an edge j→kin
the DAG G;Ω∈Rd×dis a diagonal matrix with positive entries, and ϵ∈Rdis a random vector
with independent components with mean zero and variance one, i.e., that Cov(ϵ) =Id. Denoting
B= Ω−1/2(Id−A), we have that:
Z=B−1ϵ.

observations Xrepresent the scores of 50 questions from a psychometric personality test. The
latent variables Zfollow a linear SCM, while the unknown shared linear mixing is a full-rank
matrix G∈R50×5. Then, for environment k={US,UK,AU}, the observables are generated
through X(k)=GZ(k). Here, P(US)is taken as the “observational” (reference) distribution, and
the distribution shifts in P(UK)andP(AU)are due to changes in the causal mechanisms of {Z1}and
{Z2, Z3, Z5}, respectively. Finally, the types of interventions are general; for UK, the edge Z4→Z1
is removed and the dashed red lines indicate changes in the edge weights to Z1; for AU, Z2was
intervened by removing Z5→Z2andadding Z3→Z2, while the edge Z5→Z3wasreversed , thus
changing the mechanisms of Z3andZ5. Thus, we aim to identify {Z1}and{Z2, Z3, Z5}.
We assume that we observe K≥2generalized interventional distributions that keep the mixing map
Gfixed but allow for generalized interventions to Z. That is, for environment k∈[K]we have,
X(k)=GZ(k),
where Z(k)=A(k)Z(k)+ (Ω(k))1/2ϵ(k). Similarly, we have Z(k)= (B(k))−1ϵ(k), where B(k)=
(Ω(k))−1/2(Id−A(k)).
Notably, we allow generalized interventions that allow for A(k)to be arbitrary, which includes softand
hard interventions, interventions targeting single ormultiple nodes, as well as interventions capable
ofadding orremoving parent nodes and reversing edges. This contrasts with the existing literature
on CRL, where single-node soft/hard interventions are the standard assumption [ 50,40,4,1]. See
Figure 1, for a toy example of what we aim to estimate.
Remark 1. Since we allow for general types of interventions, we can take any of the given environ-
ments as the canonical “observational” distribution with respect to which we observe interventions,
or simply that we observe kinterventions of an unknown observational distribution. This is a clear
distinction from the standard setting in CRL [ 1,50,48,23] which requires to know which environment
is a suitable observational distribution.
To develop our identifiability result and algorithm, we will make additional assumptions on the noise
distributions of the linear SEMs.
Assumption A (Noise Assumptions) .For any environment k∈[K], letϵ(k)= (ϵ(k)
1, . . . , ϵ(k)
d)be
the vector of dindependent noises with Cov(ϵ(k)) =Id. We have:
1. Identically distributed across environments: P(ϵ(k)) =P(ϵ(k′)), for all k′̸=k.
2. Non-Gaussianity: At most one noise component ϵ(k)
iis Gaussian distributed.
3. Pairwise differences: For any i̸=j, we have P(ϵ(k)
i)̸=P(ϵ(k)
j)andP(ϵ(k)
i)̸=P(−ϵ(k)
j).
Assumption A.1 is usually assumed for learning causal models from multiple environments [ 31,4].
Assumption A.2 is typically made in causal discovery methods, as detailed in seminal works such
as [43,42,19,45] and is considered a more realistic assumption [ 34]. Assumption A.3 is generally
satisfied in a generic sense; that is, when probability distributions on the real line are randomly
selected, they are pairwise different with probability one. This assumption is also adopted in [ 47,23].
Assumption B (Test Function) .We assume access to a test function ψthat maps each noise r.v. to R
s.t.ψ(ϵ(k)
i) =ψ(−ϵ(k)
i), and ψ(ϵ(k)
i)̸=ψ(ϵ(k)
j)ifϵ(k)
iandϵ(k)
jare not identically distributed.
4This assumption states that we can access a test function that can help differentiate the noise
components. One coarse example is ψ(y) =P(|y| ≤1). This assumption is introduced to better
understand our method workflow in Section 4, but it is not completely necessary. We discuss how to
relax this assumption in Appendix C. Next, we formally define a mechanism shift.
Definition 1 (Latent Mechanism Shifts) .LetPA(Z(k)
i)denote the set of parents of Z(k)
i. A latent
variable Ziis called a latent shifted node within environments kandk′, if and only if:
P(Z(k)
i|PA(Z(k)
i))̸=P(Z(k′)
i|PA(Z(k′)
i)).
Remark 2. Following Definition 1, Ziis a latent shifted node between environments kandk′if: (1)
Thei-th rows of A(k)andA(k′)are different; (2) Ω(k)
ii̸= Ω(k′)
ii; or (3) both.
Definition 1 aligns with those previously discussed in [ 52,14,10], with the key difference that we
consider changes in the causal mechanisms of the latent causal variables. However, note that our
results also contribute to the setting in which causal variables are observable considering that the
mixing function is the identity matrix, that is, G=Id.
4 Identifying Shifts in Latent Causal Mechanisms
Following the setup outlined in the previous section, our focus now turns to developing an algorithm
to identify latent shifted nodes, given data from multiple environments. First, note that we can write
the overall model as a linear ICA problem, where, for any environment k, the observation X(k)is a
linear combination of independent components ϵ(k). Specifically, we have
X(k)=GZ(k)=G(B(k))−1ϵ(k)
Under the mild conditions given in Assumption A, from classical ICA identifiability results stated in
Theorem 1, we can identify G(B(k))−1up to permutation and sign flip. Let M(k)=B(k)Hwhere
H=G†. Then, we can only identify M(k)up to permutation and sign flip, which does not suffice to
identify the latent SCM encoded in B(k). In sum, what we can only obtain from ICA is
M(k)=P(k)D(k)B(k)H
where P(k)is a permutation matrix, and D(k)is a diagonal matrix with −1or+1on its diagonal. As
Seigal et al. [40] points out, it is not possible to identify B(k)further given generalized interventions .
Our first result is that our present mild assumptions suffice to infer shifted nodes.
Theorem 2 (Identifiability) .Given access to K≥2environments, assume that A and B hold for all
environments. Then, all latent shifted nodes are identifiable.
An interesting facet of our identifiability result is that it is constructive . In the next subsection we
will provide an explicit algorithm to infer the shifted nodes and prove the main theorem above.
4.1 Constructive identifiability
Consider ϵ(k)=B(k)HX(k)andϵ(k)=M(k)X(k)=P(k)D(k)B(k)HX(k)=P(k)D(k)ϵ(k),
where ϵ(k)andM(k)are the output of ICA, which contain the permutation and sign flip ambiguities
given by P(k)D(k).
Obtaining a consistent ordering of the noise components across all environments is equivalent to
finding P(k). Under Assumption B, and without loss of generality, we consider that (ϵ(k)
1, . . . , ϵ(k)
d)
are in increasing order with respect to their ψvalues. Since ψis invariant to sign flip, we can calculate
ψ(ϵ(k)
i)for all i∈[d]and sort the calculated ψvalues in increasing order. Let P(k)denote the sorting
permutation with respect to ψ, so that post-sorting, we get P(k)ϵ(k).
Remark 3. In Appendix C, we discuss how to relax the assumption on the test function ψ.
Proposition 1. P(k)= 
P(k)T, i.e., P(k)is the inverse permutation of the ICA scrambling.
From Proposition 1, we thus find that we can unscramble the permutation P(k)by sorting with respect
toψ. We get P(k)ϵ(k)=PkP(k)D(k)ϵ(k)=D(k)ϵ(k)from the above proposition. In other words,
we can extract eϵ(k)=D(k)ϵ(k)viafM(k)=P(k)M(k)=D(k)B(k)H=D(k)M(k)after ICA and
sorting by ψ.
5Proposition 2. Given access to K≥2environments, assume that A holds. Then, Ziis identified as
a latent non-shifted node between environments kandk′if and only if M(k)
i=M(k′)
i, where M(k)
i
represents the i-th row of M(k), and M(k)=B(k)H.
All formal proofs are given in Appendix E. Our next result shows the identifiability of shifted nodes
in the unscrambled matrix fM(k).
Theorem 3. Ziis identified as a non-shifted node if and only if fM(k)
i=fM(k′)
iorfM(k)
i=−fM(k′)
i.
We can summarize this in the following algorithm, which proves Theorem 2:
• Perform ICA to obtain M(k)andϵ(k)with input X(k).
• Sort by ψto get the permutation P(k)and compute fM(k)=P(k)M(k)andeϵ(k)=P(k)ϵ(k).
•Check the condition on {fM(k)
i:k∈[K]}to detect if Ziis a shifted node, as prescribed by
Theorem 3.
4.2 Finite-sample algorithm
Thus far, we have considered the population setting where we are given the entire interventional
distributions. In practice, we are given samples from each of these interventional distributions, so that
we have Kdatasets, one for each of the interventional distributions. The overall algorithm is given
next in Alg. 1 (see illustration in Appendix B) with detailed explanations following the algorithm.

ifLk,k′
i> α then
S(k,k′)←S(k,k′)∪ {i}
Ensure: All latent shifted nodes S= (S(k,k′))k,k′
Step 1: We perform ICA with samples from X(k)to extract M(k)and samples from ϵ(k).
Remark 4 (Estimation of d.).One missing component in using ICA in practice is that, along with
samples from X(k), we need to input the number of latent nodes d, which need to be estimated from
samples. Define Σ(k)=E[X(k)X(k)T] =G(B(k))−1(B(k))−TGT. Since all matrices are full rank,
it follows that d=rank(Σ(k)), where Σ(k)can be estimated by the sample covariance matrix. Thus,
dcan also be estimated by the rank of the sample covariance matrix.
Step 2: We compute the empirical expectation of ψon samples from ϵ(k), which by law of large
number arguments, converges to its population expectation, which is ψ(ϵ(k)). We use the sorted order
of the empirical expectations to sort the noise components, unscrambling the noise components as
earlier, to get fM(k)and samples from eϵ(k).
6Step 3: Here, we explicitly construct a test statistic to check the condition on {fM(k)
i:k∈[K]}to
detect if Ziis a shifted node. Note that from our Theorem 3, there is a non-shift node Zibetween
environments kandk′if and only if fM(k)
i=±fM(k′)
i. Accordingly, we define a test statistic:
Lk,k′
i=min{∥fM(k)
i±fM(k′)
i∥1
∥fM(k)
i∥1+∥fM(k′)
i∥1
It can be seen that Lk,k′
i= 0if and only if fM(k)
i=±fM(k′)
i, which implies node Ziis not shifted
between environments kandk′. Thus, in step three of the algorithm above, for each coordinate
i∈[d], we check if there exists k̸=k′such that Lk,k′
i> α for a given threshold α. If such a k̸=k′
exists, we include iin the list of shifted nodes.
Algorithm 1 is consistent with the ground truth set of shifted nodes as napproaches infinity. Empirical
evidence supporting this claim is presented in Figure 2, which shows that with a sufficiently large
sample size, all shifted nodes are correctly identified, and the F1 score reaches 1. Further theoretical
discussion on the sample complexity of our method can be found in Appendix D.

examine scenarios with observed dimensions p= 10,20,40and plot their corresponding F1 scores
against the number of samples n. It is observed that the F1 score approaches 1 with a sufficiently
large sample size. Detailed experimental procedures and results are discussed in Section 5.
5 Experiments
In this section, we investigate the performance of our method in synthetic and real-world data.
5.1 Synthetic Data
In our setup, each noise component ϵiis sampled from a generalized normal distribution with the
probability density function given by p(ϵi)∝exp{−|ϵi|i}, where i= 1,2, . . . , d . In this noise
generation process, the noise vector ϵadheres to the condition ψ(ϵi)< ψ(ϵj)for all i < j if we
choose ψ(y) =P(|y| ≤1). Following the methodology similar to that in [ 40], we start by sampling
either an Erd ˝os-Rényi (ER) or Scale-Free (SF) graph with dnodes and an expected edge count of
md, where m∈ {2,4,6}, denoted as ERm orSFm . The observed space dimension pis set to
2d. For each graph, the weights are independently sampled from Unif±[0.25,1]and the diagonal
entries of Ωfrom Unif[2,4]. In each environment k,15% of the nodes are randomly selected for
shifting. The new weights A(k)
ifor the shifted node i, and the new entries of Ω(k), specifically Ω(k)
ii,
are independently sampled from Unif[6,8]. The mixing function Gis independently generated from
Unif[−0.25,0.25].
Empirically, we have observed that the following formulation of Lk,k′
ileads to improved results:
Lk,k′
i=∥|fM(k)
i| − |fM(k′)
i|∥1
∥fM(k)
i∥1+∥fM(k′)

ito detect shifts in the following experiment. Then we explore sample sizes nfrom
500to106, using the observed samples X(k)as input. The parameter αis set to 0.2ford≤10
and0.5for higher dimensions, reflecting the increased complexity in estimating larger dimensional
latent graphs and thus necessitating a higher tolerance for L1norm differences in detecting shifted
nodes. For each setting, we independently generate 10datasets and take the average of the metrics.
The results for n= 106are shown in Table 1, and the asymptotic consistency results for specific p
values are illustrated in Figure 2. In addition to the causal representative setting, our method can also
directly identify mechanism shifts in a fully observed setting, where G=I. We further compare
our method’s results in this fully observed setting against the baseline DCI [ 52], which addresses
direct mechanism shifts in linear settings. The results of this comparison are provided in Appendix F,
demonstrating that our method outperforms DCI in most settings.
5.2 Psychometrics Data
We evaluate our method using a dataset related to the Five Factor Model, also known as the Big Five
personality traits [ 16,15,32]. This model is a widely accepted framework, comprising five broad
dimensions that encapsulate the diversity of human personality traits. These dimensions are Openness
to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness , and Neuroticism .
The dataset utilized in our study was gathered through an interactive online personality test available
on OpenPsychometrics.org, a nonprofit endeavor aimed at educating the public about psychology
while collecting data for psychological research1. This dataset encompasses responses to 50 questions,
with 10 questions dedicated to each of the five personality dimensions. Participants responded to
each question on a scale from 1 to 5. Additionally, the dataset includes demographic information,
such as race, age, gender, and country, comprising a total of 19,719 observations.
Question formalization and data processing. In this study, we hypothesize the existence of 5
latent nodes, each representing one of the five personality dimensions, believed to be causally related.
The score responses to the 50 questions form our observed space. Our main goal is to determine
whether variations in personality dimensions can be observed across genders, thus treating gender as
one environment ( K= 2). Additionally, we investigate potential personality shifts across countries,
selecting the US and UK for analysis due to they have the most observations in our dataset. The
only preprocessing step undertaken involves the removal of observations with missing values and the

8normalization of data to fit within the [0,1]range, achieved by adjusting according to the maximum
and minimum values observed. The research question we have formalized in this study is not derived
from any data competition. It aligns with interests explored in existing psychological literature
[25, 8, 46, 29], yet our investigation is distinguished by a unique analytical framework.
Labeling latent nodes. Prior to detecting shifted nodes, it is essential to assign semantics to each
node. This process involves conducting interventions on each component of the noise vector to aid in
labeling the latent nodes. Given that the noise components are distinct for each latent node, labeling
the noise effectively equates to labeling the latent nodes.
Initially, we apply ICA to the data for males, followed by getting post-sorting fMmaleandeϵmale
as outlined in our methodology. Subsequently, we perform interventions on each noise component,
setting each to 0sequentially, and then re-mixing the intervened noise vector using (fMmale)†. By
examining the impact of these interventions on the observation space — specifically, identifying
which question scores undergo significant changes — we can assign appropriate semantic labels
to each latent node index. For instance, nullifying the first column of eϵand remixing the intervened
noise with (fMmale)†alters the score distribution in a manner that reveals the semantic domain
affected by the first noise component. An example of assigning the label Agreeableness to a latent
node is depicted in Figure 3. By applying the same process to all noise components, we are able to
assign semantic labels Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion , and Neuroticism to the remaining
latent nodes. More detailed experiment results are shown in Section G.

Figure 3: We apply an intervention to the first column of ϵand then use (cMmale)†for remixing.
The first row of the resulting histograms represents scores for 5 out of the 10 questions related to
the Extraversion personality dimension. Subsequent rows display histograms for 5 questions from
each of the other four personality dimensions, as indicated at the right end of each row. The red
distribution represents the scores before the intervention on the noise, while the blue distribution
corresponds to scores after the intervention. Overlapping areas are shown in purple. Notably, the
intervention on the first column of ϵalters the distribution in the observed space, specifically affecting
the scores for questions related to the Agreeableness personality dimension, whereas distributions
for other dimensions remain unchanged. Consequently, we can label the first noise component as
corresponding to Agreeableness .
Shifted nodes detection. To identify shifted personality dimensions across gender, we computed
Lmale,female
i for each latent node, obtaining values of {0.074,0.0497,0.078,0.638,0.633}. Setting
a tolerance threshold α= 0.5to accommodate real data estimation variances, we observed that
the last two nodes exhibit significantly higher Lmale,female
i scores, surpassing α, and thus are
considered shifted. These nodes correspond to the labels Neuroticism andExtraversion . Consistent
with existing psychological literature, women have been found to score higher in Neuroticism than
men [ 25,8,46,29], while men scored higher in the Activity subcomponent of Extraversion [8].
This discovery aligns with the findings in psychology literature. To further validate our method’s
effectiveness, a similar analysis was conducted across countries, comparing the UK and the US,
which have the most observations in our dataset. The computed LUS,UK
i for each latent node was
{0.302,0.258,0.109,0.189,0.088}. All values fell below α, indicating no latent node shifts between
9these two countries. This finding is also in agreement with existing studies that personality exhibits
stability across countries and cultures [25, 24, 11].
6 Concluding Remarks
In this study, we demonstrated that latent mechanism shifts are identifiable, up to a permutation,
within the framework of linear latent causal structures and linear mixing functions. Furthermore,
we introduced an algorithm, grounded in ICA, designed to detect these shifts. Our method offers a
broader applicability to various types of interventions compared to CRL framework. Unlike shift
detection methods where node variables are directly observable, our approach extends to scenarios
where latent variables remain unobserved. A promising future direction consists of adapting our
methodology to nonlinear transformations, which could address more complex, practical challenges,
such as identifying latent mechanism shifts in real-world image data.

Identifying General Mechanism Shifts in Linear Causal Representations
A Limitations and Broader Impacts
Limitations of this work include the need to relax the noise assumption and to consider similar
settings under nonlinear mixing functions. These are promising directions to explore in the CRL field.
The broader impact of this work is that CRL methods can be used to identify mechanism shifts and
determine root causes, which can be utilized in the biological field to find disease genes or biomarkers.
Currently, the negative impacts of this method are not clear.

Figure 4: Overview of our method: For each context k, given the data X(k), our method involves
three main steps. First, we apply ICA to each dataset to estimate ϵ(k)andM(k). Second, we calculate
ψ(ϵ(k)) ={ψ(ϵ(k)
1), ψ(ϵ(k)
2), . . . , ψ (ϵ(k)
d)}for each noise component, sort these components in
increasing order, and correspondingly arrange the rows of M(k). Third, we compare the sorted rows
ofM(k)to identify the shifted nodes.
C Discussion on Test Function
In Assumption B, we assume that there exists a test function ψand that we can access it. Here we
discuss ways to relax it. Recall that in Section 4.1, ψis utilized to sort the noise component ϵ(k)to
ensure that the post-sorting noise vector eϵ(k)has a consistent order across all environments.An alternative approach to achieve this is to use distribution matching. We take the noise vector in
the first environment as a reference and align all other noise vectors post-sorting with the reference
vector. To do this, we can use a distribution distance metric D. First, define a signed permutation
space as
Sd={S=PD|Pis a permutation matrix , Dis a diagonal matrix with Dii∈ {− 1,1}}
Then, solve the optimization problem:
min
S∈SdD(ϵ(1), Sϵ(k))
where Dcan be any distribution distance, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence. In Assumption A, we
assume pair-wise different noise component, thus the optimization questions have minimums value 0
if and only if each noise component of ϵ(1)andSϵ(k)have the same distribution, thus help us align
the noise component order. We solve this optimization problem for each environment k≥2, thus
obtaining P(k). All following steps in our algorithm remain the same when using this alternative
approach.
One small gap remains: even though all post-sorting noise vectors have a consistent order with ϵ(1),
ϵ(1)is not the ground truth order of ϵ(1). This ambiguity cannot be eliminated, consistent with the
nature of the CRL method, and is the same with other CRL methods, such as [ 40,28]. Fortunately,
the ground truth order is not so important in practice. What people mainly care about is the semantic
label for each latent node. Some CRL generative models, such as [ 54], may be helpful for performing
fake interventions and manually assigning semantic labels. However, this is beyond the scope of this
paper, and we will not discuss it further.
Even though the distribution matching optimization method offers greater flexibility, it is computa-
tionally expensive. First, note that the cardinality |Sd|=d!×2d, which represents a vast search space
when dis large. Furthermore, calculating D(·,·)is generally computationally intensive. For example,
the KL method requires density estimation, and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) method
necessitates the computation of pairwise distances among samples. These challenges render this
alternative difficult to implement. Consequently, we opt to use the ψfunction to facilitate efficient
sorting, but it may need carefully design.
D Discussion on Sample Complexity
The sample complexity of our method must be considered from two perspectives: one involves using
ICA to estimate ¯ϵ(k)andM(k), and the other pertains to utilizing ¯ϵ(k)and a test function to sort the
rows of M(k). Since the sorting step depends on the choice of test function, we assume for simplicity
thatM(k)is already sorted by the ground truth order. Thus, we only focus on the asymptotic behavior
offM(k), which closely relates to the properties of the ICA estimator.
There are various algorithms for solving ICA [ 18,17,41]; each algorithm exhibits different asymptotic
statistical properties. If we apply the findings in Auddy and Yuan [2], we assume that the estimated
ICA unmixing function has the following statistical accuracy:
Theorem 4. If the sample size n≥g(d, δ), then with probability at least 1−h(n, d, δ, ϵ ), we have:
l(fM(k)
i−M(k)
i)≤C·p(d, n)f(δ),
wherefM(k)
irepresents the i-th row of the estimated unmixing function M(k),Cis a constant, and
p,f,g, and hare known functions. For instance, in Auddy and Yuan [2],p(d, n) =p
d/n and
f(δ) =p
log(1/δ). Here, ldenotes the loss function, and the L2norm can serve as an option.
Under this theorem, for two environments kandk′, if node idoes not shift, we have:
||fMk
i−fMk′
i||2≤ ||fMk
i−Mi||2+||fMk′
i−Mi||2≤2·C·p(d, n)f(δ)
with a probability of at least 1−2h(n, d, δ, ϵ ). Thus, by setting the threshold αas2·C·p(d, n)f(δ),
we can control the false discovery rate to be at most 2h(n, d, δ, ϵ ). A similar sample complexity
theorem can be extended to cases involving more than two environments, as long as the statistical
properties of the ICA solution are known.
14E Detailed Proofs
E.1 Proof of Proposition 2
Lemma 1. Under problem setting, for any x, y∈Rd×1, the equation xTH=yTHholds if and
only if x=y.
Proof. Given that Gpossesses full column rank, it follows that H=G†has full row rank. Conse-
quently, the null space of HTis{0}. Therefore, if xTH=yTH, it implies HT(x−y) = 0 . This
leads to the conclusion that x−y= 0, which in turn implies x=y.
Proof of Proposition 2. Recall that B(k)= (Ωk)−1
2(Id−A(k)). Since A(k)is a weighted adjacency
matrix, its diagonal entries are zero. Thus,
B(k)
ij=−
Ω(k)
ii−1
2A(k)
ij ifi̸=j,
B(k)
ii=
Ω(k)
ii−1
2ifi=j.
Under Definition 1, if node Ziis shifted, it implies either 1) Ω(k)
ii̸= Ω(k′)
ii, 2)A(k)
i̸=A(k′)
i, or 3)
both conditions hold. In scenarios 1) and 3), B(k)
ii̸=B(k′)
ii, resulting in B(k)
i̸=B(k′)
i. In scenario
2), while Ω(k)
ii= Ω(k′)
ii, there exists a j∈[d]such that A(k)
ij̸=A(k′)
ij, leading to B(k)
i̸=B(k′)
i. If
node Ziis not shifted, then A(k)
i=A(k′)
iandΩ(k)
ii= Ω(k′)
ii, implying B(k)
i=B(k′)
i. Therefore,
Ziis shifted if and only if B(k)
i̸=B(k′)
i. According to Lemma 1, B(k)
i̸=B(k′)
iif and only if
B(k)
iH̸=B(k′)
iH, which is equivalent to M(k)
i̸=M(k′)
i.
In conclusion, Ziis shifted if and only if M(k)
i̸=M(k′)
i.
E.2 Proof of Theorem 3
Lemma 2. Under problem setting, it is not possible for an intervention on the latent node Zito result
inM(k)
i=−M(k′)
i.
Proof. We prove this by contradiction. Suppose that M(k)
i=−M(k′)
i. According to Lemma 1, this
would imply B(k)
i=−B(k′)
i. However, we know B(k)= (Ω(k))−1(Id−A(k))where A(k)is the
weight matrix for a DAG. Since A(k)
ii= 0, it follows that B(k)
ii= (Ω(k))−1
ii. Therefore, both B(k)
ii
andB(k′)
iiare positive. It is impossible for B(k)
ito be equal to −B(k′)
i. Consequently, the scenario
where M(k)
i=−M(k′)
icannot occur.
Proof of Theorem 3. Recall from the data generation process that
M(k)X(k)=ϵ(k).
When input X(k)to ICA, we have M(k)=P(k)D(k)M(k)andϵ(k)=P(k)D(k)ϵ(k). Without loss
of generality, we assume that ϵ(k)is ordered increasingly with respect to ψ. Thus, post sorting with
respect to ψ, we eliminate the ambiguity of P(k), and we get fM(k)=D(k)M(k)andeϵ(k)=D(k)ϵ(k).
We are now ready to prove that Ziis not shifted if and only if fM(k)=±fM(k′). This immediately
implies that if Ziis not shifted, then M(k)
i=M(k′)
i, thus satisfying fM(k)=±fM(k′).
IffM(k)=±fM(k′), there are two cases: M(k)
i=M(k′)
iorM(k)
i=−M(k′)
i. We prove in Lemma
2 that the scenario M(k)
i=−M(k′)
icannot exist. The only surviving situation is M(k)
i=M(k′)
i,
which indicates that Ziis not shifted.
15F Experiments on Synthetic Data Compared with DCI
As described in Section 5.1, instead of generating the mixing function Gfrom Unif[−0.25,0.25],
we set G=I, such that X=ZandZcan be directly observed. In this setup, finding general
interventions in linear causal representations reduces to identifying general interventions in linear
SEM, a setting for which the existing method DCI [ 52] is designed. Table 2 presents the performance
comparison between our method and DCI under these conditions, demonstrating that our method
outperforms DCI in most cases.

G Additional Information on Real Data
This section provides detailed information on the procedures employed in analyzing the real dataset.
Preprocessing The initial dataset comprised 19,719 observations, which can be
downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucasgreenwell/
ocean-five-factor-personality-test-responses/data . In the preprocess-
ing phase, any observation with a missing value in any column was excluded, leaving a total of
19,710 observations for further analysis. Subsequently, we applied max-min value normalization to
the scores of each question, ensuring that all scores were normalized to fall within the range [0,1].
This normalization step is crucial for achieving uniformity in the data scale, thereby facilitating
accurate analysis and comparison across the dataset.
Labeling the Noise To derive meaningful psychological insights, it is crucial to assign semantic
labels to all latent nodes. Given that the noise components are pairwise distinct and unique to the
latent node Zi, we consider intervening on each noise component, then remixing and observing
the changes in the observational space. This approach enables us to assign semantic labels to both
the noise components and their corresponding latent nodes. We utilize observations from the male
dataset as the reference context, which comprises 7,603 observations. Following the initial step of our
method, we obtain the sorted fMmaleandeϵmale. The mixing function Gis derived from (fMmale)†.
16To identify the semantic label for the first component of eϵ, we set its corresponding noise vector
component to 0, effectively nullifying the first component of eϵmale. This intervention yields an
estimated noise matrix samples from eϵmale
inv, denoted as eϵmale
inv. The intervened reconstruction,
Xmale
inv =G(eϵmale
intv)T, and the original score distribution, Xmale=G(eϵmale)T, allow us to compare
question scores pre- and post-intervention. Figure 7 plots these distributions, revealing significant
shifts for questions pertaining to the Agreeableness dimension, with minimal impact on other scores,
thereby identifying the first noise component as Agreeableness . This process is replicated for the
second through fifth columns of ϵmale, with results illustrated in Figures 9, 8, 5, and 6. Each plot
demonstrates that interventions result in significant distribution changes for questions related to a
single personality dimension, with negligible effects on others. Consequently, we label these noise
components as Openness ,Conscientiousness ,Extraversion , and Neuroticism , respectively. These
labels will be used for all the following analysis.
Shifted Nodes Detection We then applied our method to data from the male and female contexts.
The calculated Lmale,female
i values are {0.074,0.0497,0.078,0.638,0.633}. Based on these results,
we identify shifts in the last two personality dimensions, specifically labeled as Extraversion and
Neuroticism . Additionally, we conducted a comparative analysis of personality dimensions between
the US and UK, which have 8,753 and 1,531 observations, respectively. The computed LUS,UK
i
values are {0.302,0.258,0.109,0.189,0.088}, indicating that no latent node is considered as having
undergone shifts between these two countries.

19NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: It has been discussed in Appendix A.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
20Justification: Theorems and proposition has been completely proven in Appendix.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The whole algorithm has been discussed in Algorithm 1.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
21Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The code is published in https://github.com/TianyuCodings/
iLCS .
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The algorithm is detailed in Algorithm 1, and the implementation details are
discussed in Section 5.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We do not report statistical significance of the experiments as it follows the
traditions of CRL literature, such as [40] and [4].
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
22• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We do not report the computer resources used as it is not the primary concern
of this paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: It is discussed in Section A.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
23•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper has no such risks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: One dataset is generated by simulation, and the source of the real data has
been explicitly mentioned.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
24•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The primary new asset of the paper is the code, and the code is published in
https://github.com/TianyuCodings/iLCS .
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
