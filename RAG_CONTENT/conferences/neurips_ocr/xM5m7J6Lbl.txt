Abstract
While autonomous agents often surpass humans in their ability to handle vast and
complex data, their potential misalignment (i.e., lack of transparency regarding
their true objective) has thus far hindered their use in critical applications such as
social decision processes. More importantly, existing alignment methods provide
no formal guarantees on the safety of such models. Drawing from utility and social
choice theory, we provide a novel quantitative definition of alignment in the context
of social decision-making. Building on this definition, we introduce probably
approximately aligned (i.e., near-optimal) policies, and we derive a sufficient condi-
tion for their existence. Lastly, recognizing the practical difficulty of satisfying this
condition, we introduce the relaxed concept of safe(i.e., nondestructive) policies,
and we propose a simple yet robust method to safeguard the black-box policy of
any autonomous agent, ensuring all its actions are verifiably safe for the society.
1 Introduction
The deployment of AI systems in critical applications, such as social decision-making, is often stalled
by the following two shortcomings: 1) They are brittle and usually provide no guarantees on their
expected performance when deployed in the real world [ 8], and 2) there is no formal guarantee that
the objective they have been trained against, typically a scalar quantity such as a lossor areward ,
faithfully represents human interest at large [ 41]. Addressing these limitations is commonly referred
to as AI alignment , an umbrella term including a wide array of methods supposed to make AI systems
of different modalities behave as intended [17, 24].
Yet, to our knowledge, every metric for alignment is a posteriori , i.e., a system is deemed aligned as
long as it does not display misaligned behavior (e.g., through red teaming [ 14]). This stems from
the fact that most of these methods focus on aligning generative models of complex modalities (text,
images, video, audio, etc.) where the input and output domains are particularly vast, and where no
single metric can perfectly represent the intended behavior.
In the context of critical (e.g., social) decision processes, where an autonomous agent must repeatedly
take actions in a complex environment with many stakeholders, a posteriori alignment is not sufficient.
Indeed, for the same reasons that a society would not trust a human policymaker with hidden motives
and unknown track record, it would also distrust an autonomous policymaker whose objective is not,
a priori , perfectly clear and verifiably aligned, as the cost of a single bad action (due to their known
brittleness ) could easily outweigh the benefits of leveraging such systems. This issue is accentuated
by the fact that, unlike humans, holding a deceptive AI agent accountable remains a challenge [25].
Conversely, recent breakthroughs in AI have significantly increased its potential for beneficial use
in these critical settings. For example, tax rates and public spending are typically set periodically
by a parliament. However, this small group of representatives is inevitably overwhelmed by the
vast amount of complex economic data as well as the pleas of millions of individuals. Due to this
38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).Figure 1: Democratic (left) vs autonomous (right) governments. Transparent elections must be
replaced with reliable alignment mechanisms.
information bottleneck, governments can only make educated guesses about what is best for the
society (assuming they can come to an agreement in the first place). On the other hand, provided
that it is verifiably aligned, an autonomous government could efficiently leverage this vast amount of
information in order to find the optimal tax rates and public spending (see Figure 1).
While it is clear that a priori alignment is essential for the safe delegation of such decision power,
it comes at the cost of two unavoidable prerequisites. Firstly, it requires a definition of alignment
that is both quantitative and measurable. Given our focus on social decision processes, where the
perception of each action may differ among individuals, we define and quantify alignment by drawing
from long-established theories of utility and social choice. For completeness, we also discuss all
the assumptions that allow such a metric to exist. Secondly, one can only ensure that an agent is a
priori aligned if one independently understands (at least reasonably well) how its available actions
may affect society, regardless of how those effects are perceived. Indeed, asserting the safety of
an autonomous agent would be impossible if it could take actions with unknown consequences.
Although we make no assumption of the exact nature of this knowledge (domain specific expertise,
heuristics, physical/data-driven modeling, or a mix thereof), we assume it is encapsulated in a world
model that estimates, given an action and a current state, the probability of moving to any other state.
A natural question then arises: Can we leverage this knowledge to construct a verifiably aligned
policy? Or, at the very least, can we use it to ensure the safety of a more complex (black-box)
policy? We address these questions by introducing probably approximately aligned (PAA) and safe
policies, and by studying their existence based on the quality of this knowledge. Akin to the probably
approximately correct (PAC) framework in the theory of learnability [ 38], we are also interested
in the sample complexity of finding PAA policies. In our setting, this complexity is two-faceted:
First, the number of calls to the world model (similar to the number of calls to a perfect generative
model in [ 18]), and second, the amount of feedback (think ballots) required to confidently rank
which state is socially preferred. While we are not yet concerned with efficient PAA policies, whose
sample complexity is at most polynomial with respect to the desired tolerances, we argue that these
complexities should, at least, be independent of the number of possible states (similarly to sparse
sampling algorithms [ 19]), as most natural state spaces are infinite. We refer to such policies as
computable . Conversely, as one can decide which decisions are delegated to autonomous agents, we
assume that the action space is finite. Concretely, our contribution is threefold:
•First, we define a new type of Social Markov Decision Processes, replacing the traditional
reward with aggregated utilities of individuals. Expanding on this definition, we present a
formal quantitative definition of alignment in the context of social choice, which naturally
leads to the concept of probably approximately aligned (PAA) policies.
•Next, given an approximate world model with sufficient statistical accuracy (which we
quantitatively derive), we prove the existence of PAA policies by amending a simple sparse
sampling algorithm.
•Finally, we propose a simple and intuitive method to safeguard any black-box (poten-
tially misaligned) policy in order to ensure that it does not take any destructive decisions,
i.e., actions that might lead to a state where even the optimal policy is unsatisfactory. We
refer to these adapted policies as safepolicies.
22 Background
2.1 Utility and social choice theory
We are interested in building autonomous agents whose objective is to maximizes social satisfaction
by taking actions that alter the state of the society. In this section, we define what is meant by social
satisfaction (often called social welfare ), and we provide the conditions under which it is quantifiable.
2.1.1 Utility theory
It is commonly assumed that the agency of an individual is governed by its internal binary preference
relationship ⪯over the set of outcomes S. When presented with two choices sands′, the individual
will introspect its satisfaction (welfare) levels and either strictly prefer one outcome ( s≺s′ors′≺s)
or be indifferent to both ( s∼s′). We are interested in quantitatively measuring these welfare levels.
Debreu’s representation theorem [ 10] states that if this preference relationship is complete, continuous,
and transitive on the topological space S, then there exists infinitely many continuous, real-valued
functions u:S →R(called utility functions ) such that u(s)≤u(s′)⇔s⪯s′,∀s, s′∈ S (note
that any strictly monotonically increasing function can transform a valid utility function into another).
While these findings establish the existence of these utility functions, which are proxies for the
intrinsic welfare levels of individuals, they do not provide insights into their measurability and
interpersonal comparability. It is these two properties, however, that eventually determine what
measure of social welfare can be derived. In a nutshell, measurability and comparability impose how
much information can be extracted from the values |ui(s)−ui(s′)|andui(s)−uj(s), respectively,
for any i̸=jands̸=s′. We detail the various measurability and comparability levels in Appendix
A.1.1, and we refer to these levels as the informational basis of utilities. Apart from that, we fix
0< Umin≤ui(s)≤Umax<∞for any sandi(we will allow Umin= 0in specific cases). That
is, we assume that individuals cannot be infinitely satisfied or dissatisfied, and that they must scale
their utilities when reporting (which does not imply measurability or comparability!). Lastly, we
define ∆U≜Umax−UminandU≜{u:S → [Umin, Umax]}.
2.1.2 Social choice theory
LetIbe a society composed of Nmembers, each with its preference relationship ⪯iand a corre-
sponding utility function ui∈ U over state space S,i∈ I. LetRSbe the set of complete orderings
onSandu∈ UNbe a vector gathering the utility functions of all individuals. A social welfare
functional f(SWFL) is a mapping Df→ RSwithDf⊆ UN. In other words, it is an aggregator of
individuals’ utilities, indirectly preferences. A long line of work [ 9,32,29] has attempted to define
which conditions this SWFL should satisfy (sometimes called axioms of cardinal welfarism, see
Appendix A.1.2 for an extensive list of these properties and their respective implications). For the
remainder of this work, we will follow the common assumption that any reasonable SWFL should
satisfy the following: universality (U), informational basis invariance (XI), independence of irrelevant
alternatives (IIA), weak Pareto criterion (WP) and anonymity (A).
An important result [ 29] states that, for any informational basis (X) listed in Appendix A.1.1 and
any SWFL fsatisfying (XI), (U), (IIA) and (WP), there exists a social welfare function (SWF)
W:RN→Rsuch that, if W(u(s))> W(u(s′)), then sranks strictly higher than s′inf(u). This
is important as it states that the best social state must maximize a certain function W, which can
therefore be used as a measure of social satisfaction. In other words, the non-welfare characteristics
(i.e., any information influencing f(u)beside u, such as the judgement of an AI agent) are of
secondary importance, as they can only break ties between sands′such that W(u(s)) =W(u(s′))
and cannot be detrimental to the society. Although we do not require it in this work, maximization of
Wcan be made sufficient if one imposes Welfarism (W), e.g., by replacing (WP) with Weak Pareto
Indifference (WPI) or more drastically by imposing Continuity (C) (see Appendix A.1.2 for more
details). We are left with the following question: Given a SWFL satisfying (XI), (U), (IIA), (WP)
and (A), what is the form of the corresponding SWF? It turns out that the choice is relatively limited
and depends mostly on the informational basis invariance (XI). It has been shown, with additional
small technical assumptions [ 7], that the power mean defined in Eq. (1)covers all possible SFWL.
See Appendix A.1.3 for a detailed mapping between informational bases, SWFLs and parameter q.

2.1.3 Future discounted social welfare
At deployment, a safe autonomous agent must provide assurances that its future actions will continue
to serve the best interests of society. This becomes ill-defined if these interests evolve with time. To
address this, we assume that both Ianduare constant, i.e., ui(s;t) =ui(s;t′)≡ui(s)for all s,i
and discrete times t̸=t′. In addition, we also assume that the meaning of these utilities does not
change with time, that is, if ui(s;t)≥ui(s′;t′)for states s, s′and times t̸=t′, then i’s welfare is at
least as high in state sat time tthan in state s′at time t′(or vice versa for ≤). Finally, we assume
that the SWFL fis such that its corresponding SWF remains the same. In other words, only the
method to break ties between states can evolve through time. This makes it possible to predict, at
timet, what will be the satisfaction levels at time t′> tin any given state. However, to model the
fact that humans prefer immediate reward, we discount the utility of the state at time t′with a factor
γ(t′−t)when comparing it with the utility of the state at time t, where γ∈[0,1[is a discount factor.
From these assumptions, it becomes possible, at time t= 0, to quantify the cumulative social welfare
of any future state trajectory s1s2s3s4...by computing the quantityP∞
t=0γtWq(u(st+1)), which we
will refer to as the future discounted social welfare of that trajectory (see Section 2.2.2). Using this
quantity, we formally define alignment as follows:
An autonomous agent is aligned if and only if it always takes actions that maximize the expected
future discounted social welfare.
2.2 Social dynamics
The expectation in the above definition accounts for the inherent randomness of most natural systems.
In this section, we model the social dynamics as a particular type of Markov Decision Process (MDP),
where the probability of transitioning to any state depends solely on the current state and next action.
2.2.1 Markov decision process
LetM= (S,A, p, r, γ )be an infinite horizon, γ-discounted, discrete time MDP where Sis the state
space (discrete or continuous), Ais the action space (discrete or continuous), p:S × A → P (S)
is the transition dynamics of the environment (with P(S)the set of probability distributions over
S),r:S × A → [Rmin, Rmax]is the reward of the environment, and γ∈[0,1[is a discount factor
(favoring immediate over distant rewards). Given s∈ Sanda∈ A,p(s′|s, a)is the probability of
transitioning to state s′after taking action ain state s, and r(s, a)is the expected immediate reward
after taking that action. In MDPs, actions are chosen according to a policy π:S → P (A), with π(a|s)
the probability of taking action ain state s. Given an initial state s0, the tuple (M, π, s 0)fully defines
a distribution pτover trajectories τ=s0a0s1a1s2a2..., where at∼π(·|st)andst+1∼p(·|st, at).
If the environment dynamics or the policy are deterministic, we will use the slight abuse of notation
st+1=p(st, at)andat=π(st), respectively. The efficacy of a given policy πis measured by the
state and state-action value functions, defined respectively as follows:
Vπ(s) =Eτ∼pτ(·|π,s0=s)"∞X
t=0γtr(st, at)#
, Qπ(s, a) =r(s, a) +γEs′∼p(·|a,s)[Vπ(s′)].
For a given state sand action a, the optimal state and action-state value functions are defined by
V∗(s) = supπVπ(s)andQ∗(s, a) = supπQπ(s, a). Given ε≥0, a policy is called ε-optimal
(or optimal) if it satisfies Vπ(s)≥V∗(s)−ε(respectively Vπ(s) =V∗(s)) for all s. Given small
technical assumptions, it can be shown that there always exists an optimal policy [37, 12].
42.2.2 Social Markov decision process
Definition (Social Markov Decision Process ).LetIbe a society with utility profile u∈ UNand
social welfare function Wq. In addition, let SandAbe the corresponding state and action spaces, p
the social environment dynamics and γa discount factor. The MDP (S,A, p, rI, γ)with reward rI
defined by
rI(s, a) =Es′∼p(·|s,a)[Wq(u(s′);I)] (2)
is a Social Markov Decision Process (SMDP), denoted MI= (S,A, p, W q,u, γ).
In this setting, Scontains all the possible states of the Nindividuals, as well as all those of the
environment in which they evolve, and Acontains all the actions that are delegated to an autonomous
agent. Expanding on this definition, we can formally define the alignment metric proposed above:
Definition (Expected Future Discounted Social Welfare ).LetMI= (S,A, p, W q,u, γ)be a SMDP.
The expected future discounted social welfare of a policy πin state sis defined as
Wπ(s) =Eτ∼pτ(·|π,s0=s)"∞X
t=0γtWq(u(st+1);I)#
,
and takes value between Wmin≜Umin
1−γandWmax≜Umax
1−γ, with ∆W≜Wmax− W min.
As shown with the next lemma, the expected future discounted social welfare of a SMDP is equivalent
to the state value function of the corresponding MDP. This equivalence makes it a natural metric for
alignment, as it enables the use of a wide array of known results on MDPs.
Lemma 1. For any SMDP MI= (S,A, p, W q,u, γ), the expected future discounted social welfare
of a policy πis the state value function of πin the MDP M= (S,A, p, rI, γ), with rIset in Eq. (2).
The proof follows directly from the tower property of conditional expectations (see Appendix A.2.1).
2.2.3 Approximate rewards
Ifpis unknown, the true reward of the SMDP in Eq. (2)can only be estimated a posteriori , i.e.,
after taking action ain state smultiple times and observing Wq(u(s′)). This would require a long
exploration phase if Sis large, which can be costly and even impossible in critical decisions processes.
Instead, one must usually plan using an approximate dynamics model ˆp∈ P(S)to anticipate the
effect of an action. Moreover, even if pis known, computing Wq(u(s′))exactly for a given s′∼p
would require full knowledge of u(s′), which is only possible by obtaining feedback from the entire
society about s′without making additional assumptions on u. For these reasons, we consider a more
realistic scenario: Given a set of assessors In⊆ I of size n≤Nand an approximate dynamics
model ˆp, the true reward can be approximated by asking the assessors about their utilities on the
anticipated future societal states:
ˆrIn(s, a;K) =ˆEK
s′∼ˆp(·|s,a)[Wq(u(s′);In)]≜1
KKX
k=1Wq(u(sk)). (3)
where ˆEK
s′∼ˆpis a “Monte Carlo” estimation of Es′∼ˆp, with K∈Nsamples independently drawn
from ˆp(·|s, a), denoted s1, s2..., sK. The core of our analysis is to understand how K,nand the
inaccuracies of ˆpaffect the validity of alignment guarantees.
3 Results
3.1 Existence of aligned policies
Having formally derived a quantitative measure of alignment Wπin the context of social decision
processes, we are now prepared to introduce and prove the existence of verifiably aligned policies:
Definition (Probably Approximately Aligned Policy ).Given 0≤δ < 1,ε > 0and a SMDP
MI= (S,A, p, W q,u, γ), a policy πisδ-ε-PAA (Probably Approximately Aligned) if, for any
given s∈ S, the following inequality holds with probability at least 1−δ:
Wπ(s)≥max
π′Wπ′(s)−ε (4)
5Definition (Approximately Aligned Policy ).Given ε > 0, a policy πisε-AA (Approximately
Aligned) if and only if it is 0-ε-PAA.
We state below one of our main contribution, i.e., the existence of computable PAA and AA policies,
which follows directly from Theorem 3 ( δ >0) and Corollary 4 ( δ= 0) in the next section.
Theorem 2 (Existence of PAA and AA policies) .Given a SMDP MI= (S,A, p, W q,u, γ)with
q∈Rand any tolerances ε >0and0≤δ <1, if there exists an approximate world model ˆpsuch
that
sup
(s,a)∈S×ADKL(p(·|s, a)∥ˆp(·|s, a))<ε2(1−γ)4
8∆W2, (5)
then there exists a computable δ-ε-PAA policy. Consequently, there also exists a computable ε-AA
policy.
3.2 Near optimal planning
We prove Theorem 2 by providing a planning policy πPAA and by proving it satisfies Eq. (4)under
the given assumptions. To this end, we present a modified version of the sparse sampling algorithm
[19] (which originally assumes that pandrare known, which is not the case here). Given some
parameters K, C andn, we define the recursive functions:
ˆQh(s, a;K, C, I n) =(0 h= 0
ˆrIn(s, a;K) +γˆEC
s′∼ˆp(·|s,a)h
ˆVh−1(s′;K, C, I n)i
h∈N∗ (6)
ˆVh(s;K, C, I n) = max
a∈AˆQh(s, a;K, C, I n).
Intuitively, ˆQhandˆVhare recursive approximations of Q∗andV∗,KandCcontrols the accuracy of
the empirical expectation operators in ˆQ,hcontrols how far one looks into the future, and ncontrols
the accuracy of the social welfare function estimates. The proposed PAA policy is simply the greedy
policy acting on the state-action value estimates, i.e.,
πPAA(s) = max
a∈AˆQH(s, a;K, C, I n). (7)
It is deterministic in the sense that, for a given ˆQH, it outputs a single action. However, ˆQHis
non-deterministic since Inands′are sampled randomly. The next results clarifies under which
conditions πPAA is indeed δ-ε-PAA (Theorem 3) or ε-AA (Corollary 4).

See Appendix A.2.2 for the full derivation of these two results. We now outline a proof sketch.
The skeleton of the proof is similar to the one proposed by Kearns et al. [19] for their original
sparse sampling algorithm, although several additional tricks and intermediate results are necessary
to accommodate the approximate world model ˆpand reward ˆrI. First, we derive a concentration
inequality for the power mean function in order to quantify the approximation error between Wq(·;In)
andWq(·;I). Using a slightly modified (two-sided) version of the Hoeffding-Serfling inequality
[4, 33] (see Lemma 9 in Appendix A.2.1), we find the following bounds:
Lemma 5. LetWqbe the power-mean defined in Eq. (1), with q∈R. Given a, b∈R∗
+(orR+
forq= 1) such that a < b , letX ∈ [a, b]Nbe a set of size Nand let Xnbe a subset of size

UminandUmax in our setting). Worse, for q=±∞, the bound depends linearly on n. Indeed,
q=−∞ corresponds to the egalitarian rule, which defines social welfare as the lowest welfare
among individuals. As this individual might be unique, the probability of not selecting it in Incan
be as high as 1−n
N. The same argument can be made for q= +∞, which is why we purposefully
avoid these scenarios in Theorems 2, 3 and 8. Regarding the error induced by the approximate model
ˆp, we bound it using the following lemma:
Lemma 6. Letf:S → [fmin, fmax]be a bounded function with 0≤fmin≤fmax<∞, and
p,ˆp∈ P(S)be two distributions such that DKL(p∥ˆp)≤d∈Rand . Then

See Appendix A.2.1 for the full proof. Combining Lemmas 5 and 6 along with other classical
concentration inequalities, we can bound the error |Q∗(s, a)−ˆQh(s, a)|with high probability. The
last step of the proof is to quantify how this error affects the state value function VπPAA (consequently
WπPAA from Lemma 1), which can be done using the following results:
Lemma 7. LetˆQbe a (randomized) approximation of Q∗such that |Q∗(s, a)−ˆQ(s, a)| ≤εwith
probability at least 1−δfor any state-action pair (s, a), with ε >0and0≤δ <1. LetπˆQbe the
greedy policy defined by πˆQ(s) = arg max a∈AˆQ(s, a). Then, for all states s:
1)V∗(s)−VπˆQ(s)≤2ε
1−γ+γk(Vmax−Vmin)with probability at least 1−2kδ,∀k∈N∗,
2)V∗(s)−VπˆQ(s)≤2ε+ 2δ(Vmax−Vmin)
1−γalmost surely.
7These are fairly general results as they do not depend on how ˆQis derived. Statements closely related
to2)have already been shown [19, 35]. We provide a proof in Appendix A.2.1 for completeness.
3.3 Safe policies
Although Theorem 2 may initially inspire optimism regarding the title of the paper, the policy πPAA
proposed in Eq. (7)is expensive for small ε, both in terms of sample complexity and in terms of
required accuracy of the world model. A more efficient PAA policy derived in future work might
partially solve the sample complexity issue, but the challenge of building predictive models of high
accuracy remains untouched. In most realistic settings, DKL(p∥ˆp)is imposed by the state-of-the-art
knowledge upon which ˆpis built, which implicitly restricts the achievable tolerance ε. Therefore, it
seems unlikely that such policies could be used as a primary tool for social decisions, as their sole
objective would be to maximize a dubious approximation of social welfare. On the other hand, even
for large ε, we will show that we can use our PAA policy to adapt anyblack-box policy π(e.g., a
policy built on top of a LLM) into a safepolicy, which we formally define as follows:
Definition (Safe Policy ).Given ω∈[Wmin,Wmax]and0< δ < 1, a policy πisδ-ω-safe if, for
any current state s, the inequality Es′∼p(·|s,a)h
supπ′Wπ′(s′)i
≥ωholds with probability at least
1−δfor any action asuch that π(a|s)>0.
Intuitively, a safe policy ensures (with high probability and in expectation over the environment
dynamics) that the society is not led in a destructive state, that is, a state which might generate high
immediate satisfaction but where no policy can generate an expected future discounted social welfare
of at least ω. This is considerably weaker than the PAA requirements, as we are no longer concerned
about social welfare optimality. The ability to adapt any black-box policy into a safe policy would
allow to leverage their strengths while fully removing their brittleness (by bounding the probability
of a destructive decision by any desired value δ >0). To this end, we use another type of policy:
Definition (Restricted Version of a Black-Box Policy ).Letπ:S → A be any policy and ¯A(s)⊆ A
be restricted subsets of actions for all states s, with Π(s)≜P
a∈¯A(s)π(a|s). The restricted version
¯πofπis defined as
¯π(a|s)≜

0 a∈ A \ ¯A(s)or Π(s) = 0 ,
π(a|s)
1−Π(s)a∈¯A(s) and 0<Π(s)<1,
π(a|s)a∈¯A(s) and Π(s) = 1 ,(10)
This is similar to action masking presented in [ 20]. It might happen that ¯π(a|s) = 0 for all actions
a, in which case it stops operating. However, if this happens, we have the guarantee that, with high
probability, the society is currently not in a destructive state. The challenge lies in finding what are
the subset of safe actions for every s. Our proposed method to safeguard any policy is the following:
Theorem 8 (Safeguarding a Black-Box Policy) .Given a SMDP MI= (S,A, p, W q,u, γ)with
q∈R, a predictive model ˆpand desired tolerances ω∈[Wmin,Wmax]and0< δ < 1,
define ˆQω(s, a)≜ˆQH(s, a;K, C, I n)with ˆQHgiven in Eq. (6)and any H, K, C, n ≥1.
For any policy π, letπsafe be the restricted version of πobtained with the restricted subsets
Asafe(s)≜{a∈ A:ˆQω(s, a)≥γω+Umax+α}, where
α≜2∆Ud′

and with the shortened notation Γmax≜Γ(Umax, Umin, Umax, q),d′≜q
min{d
2,1−e−d}and
d≜sup(s,a)DKL(p(·|s, a)∥ˆp(·|s, a)). Then πsafe isδ-ω-safe.
See Appendix A.2.3 for the full proof. While we are, in theory, not restricted by the statistical
accuracy of the world model to find a safe version of any black-box policy, low statistical accuracy
will, in practice, drastically reduce the number of verifiably safe actions, which at some point will
render the safe policy obsolete (as it will refuse to take any action).
84 Related work
MDP for social choice MDPs have already been used in the context of social decision processes.
For instance, Parkes and Procaccia [28] (and more recently [ 21]) use social choice MDPs in order to
tackle decision-making under dynamic preferences. However, their setting is significantly different
from ours: In their work, the state space Sis the set of preference profiles UN, and pdictate how
these preferences evolve based on the outcome selected by the social choice functional (the policy).
Another relevant line of study is that of preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) [ 40], where
the traditional numerical reward of the underlying MDP is replaced with relative preferences between
state-action trajectories. While social decision processes can also be cast as a PbRL problem, no
previous work has attempted to formally and quantitatively define social alignment in that setting.
AI safety A long line of work has attempted to address the challenge of building verifiably safe
autonomous systems [ 2,30]. In the context of MDPs, safe reinforcement learning (RL) tackles this
challenge by introducing safety constraints [ 1]. See [ 15,20] for comprehensive surveys on the topic.
However, RL relies on exploration, which is not allowed in our setting. On the other hand, existing
planning methods (where exploration is not needed if a world model ˆpis available) do not relate the
accuracy of ˆpto the validity of the desired safety guarantees, as they mostly assume that pis known.
Alignment The goal of alignment can be entirely different based on the context [ 13]. Recent
research on this topic has primarily focused on aligning large language models (LLMs) [ 17] using
human feedback [ 6,26] and derivatives [ 11,39,5]. While some work has attempted to tackle LLM
alignment from a social choice perspective [ 22], the issue of aligning the meaning of generated text
is, by nature, both qualitative and subjective, and therefore separate from ours. A setting closer to our
work is the value alignment problem [34,23], based on the theory of basic human values [ 31], where
the preferences of individuals (over social states) are assumed to be guided by a predefined set of
common values, and where the goal is to find “norms” (i.e., hard-coded logical constraints on actions)
that guide society towards states that maximize these values. The alignment of these norm can be
quantified by measuring the level of these values in the subsequent states, and the alignment of an
autonomous system is simply given by the alignment of the norms it follows. However, this measure
is intractable in most realistic settings, as it must be computed over all possible state trajectories [ 34].
5 Limitations and future work
From a practical standpoint, the main challenge lies in building a reliable world model ˆp, since PAA
guarantees depend on its statistical accuracy, which can only be measured exactly if the true world
model pis known. In practice, a conservative estimate of this accuracy could be used instead. Another
limitation arises from the dependence on the informational basis of utilities, a philosophical question
that falls outside the scope of this paper but that is common to all systems involving human feedback.
A third practical limitation is the assumptions that individuals can observe and evaluate the entire
social states when reporting their utilities. Future work could extend our analysis to the setting of
partially observable MDP (POMDP) [ 42], for instance. Finally, the assumption that individuals have
static preferences can also be challenged, but it is not clear how evolving preferences can be modeled,
let alone factored in our analysis. From a theoretical perspective, the complexity results presented in
the various theorems are poor for q̸= 1andγ≈1. These dependencies are hard to improve, as they
relate to a known property of the power mean [ 7] and the ability to foresee the future, respectively.
Lastly, while we make no assumption about the distribution of utilities u, one could investigate how
such assumptions might improve these complexities (e.g., using Bernstein-Serfling inequality [4]).
6 Conclusion
We present a formal and quantitative definition of alignment in the context of social choice, leading
to the concept of probably approximately aligned policies. Using an approximate world model, we
derive sufficient conditions for such policies to exist (and be computable ). In addition, we introduce
the relaxed concept of safepolicies, and we present a method to make any policy safe by restricting
its action space. Overall, this work provides a first attempt at rigorously defining the alignment of
governing autonomous agents, and at quantifying the resources ( n,K,C,H) and knowledge ( ˆp)
needed to enforce the desired level of alignment ( ε) or safety ( ω) with high confidence ( δ).

A.1 Utility and Social Choice Theory
A.1.1 Measuring and comparing utilities
Measurability of u∈ U can either be cardinal , where one can numerically measure absolute levels
of satisfaction for a given state up to positive affine transformations, or ordinal , where one can only
hope to rank states, meaning one can numerically measure utilities only up to increasing monotone
transformations [ 16,36,27]. Additional dichotomization becomes possible when comparability is
taken into account [ 29,9,32]. In a nutshell, utilities are either ordinal non-comparable (ONC), where
individuals transform their intrinsic utilities differently when reporting; cardinal non-comparable
(CNC), which is similar to ONC but with cardinal measurability), ordinal level comparable (OLC),
where individuals transform their intrinsic utilities similarly when reporting; cardinal unit comparable
(CUC), in which the affine transforms of the individuals have identical scaling factor but different
bias; cardinal fully comparable (CFC), where individuals have the same affine transform; or cardinal
ratio-scale comparable (CRS), in which all transforms are unbiased with the same scaling factor.
Note that CRS is stronger than CFC in the sense that one can have statements such has “Bob is xtimes
more satisfied than Alice” under the CRS assumption. In this paper, we refer to this classification as
theinformational basis of utilities.
A.1.2 SWFL properties and implications
Here is a list of the most common properties imposed on a given SWFL f:Df→ RS, along with
their definitions. We denote ⪯f(u)the binary preference relationship corresponding to f(u), that is,
s⪯f(u)s′if and only if s′ranks equally or higher than sinf(u).
(U) Universality or unrestricted domain: Df=UN.
(IIA) Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives: For every u,u′∈ UNandS′⊆ S, ifu(s) =u′(s)
for all s∈ S′, then fS′(u) =fS′(u′), where fS′(u)is the partial ranking obtained after
excluding S \ S′from f(u).
(WP) Weak Pareto criterion or unanimity: For all pairs s, s′∈ S, ifu(s)>u(s′), then sranks
strictly higher than s′inf(u).
(WPI) Weak Pareto with Indifference criterion: For all pairs s, s′∈ S, ifu(s)≥u(s′), then s
ranks equally or higher than s′inf(u).
(SP) Strong Pareto criterion: For all pairs s, s′∈ S, if there exists i∈ Isuch that ui(s)> ui(s′)
anduj(s)≥uj(s′),∀j∈ I \ { i}, then sranks strictly higher than s′inf(u).
(NI) Non-Imposition: For all R∈ R, there exists u∈ Dfsuch that f(u) =R.
(C) Continuity: For any v∈RNands, s′∈ S, the sets
{v′∈RN:u(s′) =v′,u(s) =vands⪯f(u)s′for some u∈ UN},
and
{v′∈RN:u(s′) =v′,u(s) =vands′⪯f(u)sfor some u∈ UN}
are closed.
(WC) Weak Continuity: For any u∈ UNandε∈RN
+, there exists u′∈ UNsuch that
f(u) =f(u′)and0<u(s)−u′(s)<εfor all s∈ S (component-wise inequalities).
(N)Neutrality or welfarism: For all quadruples s, s′, t, t′∈ S, ifu,u′∈ UNare such that
u(s) =u′(s′)andu(t) =u′(t′), then f(u)andf(u′)agree on the partial rankings of (s, t)
and(s′, t′)(i.e., either sands′are preferred, or either tandt′).
(A) Anonymity or symmetry: For all u∈ UN,f(u) =f(u′)withu′any permutation of u.
(ND) Non-Dictatorship: There is no single individual isuch that ⪯i=⪯f(u)for any u.
(IC) Incentive compatibility: It is in the best interest of each individual to report their true
preferences (i.e., there is no tactical voting).
12(S)Separability or independence of unconcerned agents: For all u,u′∈ U, if there exists
I′⊆ I such that ui=α∈Randu′
i=α′∈Rfori∈ I′, and ui=u′
ifori∈ I \ I′, then
f(u) =f(u′).I′is the set of unconcerned agents.
(PDT) Pigou-Dalton Transfer principle: Define ¯u(s) =P
i∈Iui(s). For all u∈ UNands, t∈ S
such that ¯u(s) = ¯u(t), if|ui(s)−¯u(s)| ≤ |ui(t)−¯u(t)|for all i∈ I, then sranks equally
or higher than tinf(u).
(XI) Informational basis Invariance (XI): The SWFL is invariant under the given measurability
and comparability assumptions: (ONCI), (CNCI), (CUCI), (CFCI), (CRSI), (OLCI). That
is,f(u) =f(u′)for any two utility profile u,u′that are undistinguishable under the given
informational basis.
We now provide a short, intuitive explanation for the properties (U), (XI), (IIA), (WP) and (A) that we
impose in this work. Enforcing unrestricted domains ensures that the SWFL always outputs a ranking.
Informational basis invariance ensures that the SWFL outputs the same ranking for two preference
profiles that are indistinguishable under the given measurability and comparability assumptions.
Independence of irrelevant alternatives ensures that the rankings are robust, in the sense that they are
not incoherently affected by removing or adding other options. The weak Pareto criterion ensures
that the SWFL represents reasonably well the preference of society (if an outcome is unanimously
preferred over another, then it must also be preferred at the social level). Anonymity ensures that
all individuals have equal influence on the social ranking. Lastly, we recall a few important results
(assuming |S| ≥ 3).
• (CRSI) ⇒(CFCI) ⇒(CUCI) ⇒(CNCI) ⇒(ONCI). Additionally (OLCI) ⇒(ONCI).
•(XI) + (U) + (IIA) + (WP) ⇒There exists W:RN→Rsuch that W(u(s))> W(u(s′))
implies that sranks strictly higher than s′inf(u). This is important as it states that the best
social state smust maximize W. In other words, even if fis not neutral, the non-welfarism
characteristics are of a secondary importance and can only break ties between sandtsuch
thatW(u(s)) =W(u(t)). Maximization can be made sufficient if one imposes (W) on f
(e.g., by replacing (WP) by (WPI) or more drastically by imposing continuity on f).
•Arrow’s impossibility theorem [ 3]: (ONCI) + (U) + (WP) + (I) ⇒ ¬ (ND). While this theorem
seems to prevent any hope of finding good SWFLs, its statement is strongly dependent
on the (often hidden) ONCI assumptions. Indeed, it is challenging to find a good social
aggregator that only knows rankings of alternatives. Strengthening the measurability and
comparability assumptions (and thus narrowing the informational basis invariance property)
allows to find SWFLs that are non-dictatorial.
• (A)⇒(ND).
• Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem (single winner elections): (ONCI) + (IC) ⇒ ¬ (ND).
• (SP) ⇒(WP) but the converse is not true.
• (XI) ⇒(WC)

Lemma 6. Letf:S → [fmin, fmax]be a bounded function with 0≤fmin≤fmax<∞, and

where we have used the definition of the total variation distance: δ(p,ˆp) =1

S|p(s)−ˆp(s)|ds. By
Pinsker’s inequality, we have
δ(p,ˆp)≤r

2DKL(p∥ˆp).
Additionally, by Bretagnolle and Huber’s inequality:
δ(p,ˆp)≤p
1−e−DKL(p∥ˆp).
The result follows from the assumption DKL(p∥ˆp)≤d.
Lemma 7. LetˆQbe a (randomized) approximation of Q∗such that |Q∗(s, a)−ˆQ(s, a)| ≤εwith
probability at least 1−δfor any state-action pair (s, a), with ε >0and0≤δ <1. LetπˆQbe the
greedy policy defined by πˆQ(s) = arg max a∈AˆQ(s, a). Then, for all states s:
1)V∗(s)−VπˆQ(s)≤2ε
1−γ+γk(Vmax−Vmin)with probability at least 1−2kδ,∀k∈N∗,
2)V∗(s)−VπˆQ(s)≤2ε+ 2δ(Vmax−Vmin)
1−γalmost surely.
Proof. First, note that if |Q∗(s, a)−ˆQ(s, a)| ≤εwith probability at least 1−δfor all state-action
pairs (s, a), then Q∗(s, π∗(s))−Q∗(s, πˆQ(s))≤2εwith probability at least 1−2δsince
Q∗(s, π∗(s))≤ˆQ(s, π∗(s)) +ε≤ˆQ(s, πˆQ(s)) +ε≤[Q∗(s, πˆQ(s)) +ε] +ε.
The factor 2in the probability comes from the fact that we need the ˆQestimates to be accurate for
both actions π∗(s)andπˆQ(s). For the first inequality, note that, with probability at least 1−2kδ, the
17firstkestimates of ˆQare2ε-accurate for actions π∗(st)andπˆQ(st),t= 0, ..., k−1. If this happens,
then we have
V∗(s)−VπˆQ(s) =Q∗(s, π∗(s))−QπˆQ(s, πˆQ(s))
≤2ε+Q∗(s, πˆQ(s))−QπˆQ(s, πˆQ(s))

≤2εk−1X
t=0γt+γk(Vmax−Vmin)
≤2ε
1−γ+γk(Vmax−Vmin),
which concludes the first part of the proof. Concerning the second inequality, since Vmin≤
Q∗(s, a)≤Vmax, we have
EˆQh
Q∗(s, πˆQ(s))i
≥(1−2δ)[Q∗(s, π∗(s))−2ε]+2δVmin≥Q∗(s, π∗(s)−(2ε+2δ(Vmax−Vmin)).
Letπjbe a policy that replicates πˆQfor the first jactions and that is optimal from action j+ 1
onward. We now show by induction that Vπj(s)≥V∗(s)−λjfor all s, where λ=λ1=
2ε+ 2δ(Vmax−Vmin)andλj=λ+γλj−1forj >1. This clearly holds for j= 1:
Vπ1(s) =EˆQh
r(s, πˆQ(s)) +γEs′∼p(·|s,πˆQ(s))[V∗(s′)]i
=EˆQh
Q∗(s, πˆQ(s))i

=V∗(s)−λ1.
Forj >1, assuming that the statement holds for j−1, we have
Vπj(s) =EˆQh
r(s, πˆQ(s)) +γEs′∼p(·|s,πˆQ(s))[Vπj−1(s′)]i

We now show that limj→∞Vπj(s) =VπˆQ(s)for all s. Noting that Vπj(s)≥VπˆQ(s)(due to the
optimality of πjafterjsteps), we have
0≤Vπj(s)−VπˆQ(s) =Eτ∼pτ(·|πj,s0=s)"∞X

Proof. Similarly to [ 19], the core idea (and challenge) of the proof is to bound |Q∗(s, a)−ˆQH(s, a)|
for all state-action pairs so that Lemma 7. However, in contrast with [ 19], we must now deal with an
approximate dynamics model, as well as an approximate reward, which significantly complicates the
task. To do so, we write the following for h >0(omitting the dependency of K,CandInin the

and where the last inequality is obtained after a careful analysis of the absolute value operator. This
suggests that we can proceed by induction on h. Let α0≜∆U
1−γandαh≜ε1+ε2+ε3+γ(ε4+
ε5+αh−1)forh >0, and let ϕ0≜0andϕh≜δ1+δ3+δ5+C|A|ϕh−1forh >0. We start the
induction by noting that, for any state-action pair,
|Q∗(s, a)−ˆQ0(s, a)|=|Q∗(s, a)| ≤∆U
1−γ=α0 with probability 1 = 1−ϕ0
Forh >1, assuming that, for any state-action pair, |Q∗(s, a)−ˆQh−1(s, a)| ≤αh−1with probability
at least 1−ϕh−1, we have from above
|Q∗(s, a)−ˆQh(s, a)| ≤ε1+ε2+ε3+γ(ε4+ε5+αh−1) =αh (17)
with probability at least 1−δ1−δ3−δ5−C|A|ϕh−1= 1−ϕh, as we require that all Cestimates
ofˆQh−1are accurate for each action. Solving for αH, we get
αH=H−1X

21Note that ε2andε4in Eq. (16) are non-controllable and only depend on the accuracy of the en-
vironment model ˆp. If we require |V∗(s)−VπPAA(s)| ≤ε, then we must have2(ε2+γε4)
(1−γ)2< ε
from Lemma 7. Using the definitions of ε2andε4from Eq. (16), this condition becomes
min{d
2,1−e−d}<(1−γ)6ε2
16∆U2withd≜sup(s,a)DKL(p(·|s, a)∥ˆp(·|s, a)). Since ε≤∆U
(1−γ)(as
the bound would be trivial otherwise), the right-hand side of the inequality is less than 1, and thus it is
less restrictive (on ˆp) to only boundd
2(asx
2≤1−e−xforx∈[0,1]), which concludes the proof on
the required accuracy of the dynamics model. Now that we have ensured that the environment model
is accurate enough, we must choose the algorithm’s parameters (namely K,Candn) to ensure that
the other inaccuracies do not exceed the remaining “approximation budget"
ε−2(ε2+γε4)

Solving for ϕH, we get

C|A| − 1

where the last inequality follows from the fact that C|A| − 1≥1
2C|A|asC≥1and|A| ≥ 2.

A.2.3 Safe policies
Theorem 8 (Safeguarding a Black-Box Policy) .Given a SMDP MI= (S,A, p, W q,u, γ)with
q∈R, a predictive model ˆpand desired tolerances ω∈[Wmin,Wmax]and0< δ < 1,
define ˆQω(s, a)≜ˆQH(s, a;K, C, I n)with ˆQHgiven in Eq. (6)and any H, K, C, n ≥1.
For any policy π, letπsafe be the restricted version of πobtained with the restricted subsets

min{d
2,1−e−d}and
d≜sup(s,a)DKL(p(·|s, a)∥ˆp(·|s, a)). Then πsafe isδ-ω-safe.
Proof. Assuming there exists an optimal policy in MI(see [ 12,37] for the necessary conditions), and
knowing from Lemma 1 that Vπ(s) =Wπ(s)for any policy, we can write supπ′Wπ′(s) =V∗(s).
Therefore, the condition for safe actions becomes Es′∼p(·|s,a)[V∗(s′)]≥ω. Using the definition of
the optimal state-action value function Q∗:
Q∗(s, a) =rI(s, a) +γEs′∼p(·|s,a)[V∗(s′)],
we can rewrite this condition once again as
Q∗(s, a)≥γω+rI(s, a).
We know from Eq. (17) in the proof of Theorem 3 that, for any state-action pair (s, a),
|Q∗(s, a)−ˆQH(s, a;K, C, I n)| ≤αHwith probability at least 1−ϕH, where αHandϕHare
given in Eq. (18) and(19), respectively. That is, if ˆQH(s, a;K, C, I n)≥γω+rI(s, a) +αH, then
the above condition is satisfied with probability at least 1−ϕH.
From Eq. (18), we have
αH≤ε2+γε4
1−γ+ε1+ε3+γε5

Finally, in order to obtain a δ-ω-safe policy, we must have ϕH≤δ. From Eq. (19), this is satisfied if
2(δ1+δ3+δ5)(C|A|)H−1≤δ,
or similarly if δ1=δ3=δ5=δ
6(C|A|)H−1.
Defining d′=q
min{d
2,1−e−d}andΓmax = Γ( Umax, Umin, Umax, q), and substituting

Using the fact that rI(s, a)≤Umax for any state-action pair, we can conservatively define the
restricted subsets of safe actions as Asafe(s) ={a:ˆQH(s, a;K, C, I n)≥γω+Umax+α}for any
states, where αis the right-hand term of the above inequality. Therefore, restricting any policy π
with these subsets ensures that Es′∼p(·|s,a)[V∗(s′)]≥ωwith probability at least 1−δfor any action
athat has a non-zero probability of being selected.
25NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The three claims made in the abstract and introduction reflect accurately the
framework presented in Section 2 and the results presented in Section 3.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main theoretical and practical limitations of the results are presented in
Section 5. The assumptions are extensively discussed in Section 2, and the complexity of
the proposed method is discussed in Sections 3 and 5.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
26Answer: [Yes]
Justification: For the main results, Theorem 2 follows simply from Theorem 3 and Corollary
4, whose respective proofs are sketched in Section 3.2 and fully derived in Appendix A.2.2.
The proof of Theorem 8 is presented in Appendix A.2.3. All intermediate results (lemmas)
are derived in Appendix A.2.1.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
275.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
28•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have reviewed the Code of Ethics, and we have conducted our work in
accordance with it. The very subject of our paper is to make AI safer, and to understand
when it is not. We do not foresee any misuse of our results.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The broader impact of the paper is readily evident from the context and the
results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
29•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
30•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
