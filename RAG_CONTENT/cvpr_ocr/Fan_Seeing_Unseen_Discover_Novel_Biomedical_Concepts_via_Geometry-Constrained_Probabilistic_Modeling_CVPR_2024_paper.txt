Abstract
Machine learning holds tremendous promise for trans-
forming the fundamental practice of scientiﬁc discovery by
virtue of its data-driven nature. With the ever-increasing
stream of research data collection, it would be appealing
to autonomously explore patterns and insights from obser-
vational data for discovering novel classes of phenotypes
and concepts. However, in the biomedical domain, there
are several challenges inherently presented in the cumu-
lated data which hamper the progress of novel class dis-
covery. The non-i.i.d. data distribution accompanied by
the severe imbalance among different groups of classes es-
sentially leads to ambiguous and biased semantic represen-
tations. In this work, we present a geometry-constrained
probabilistic modeling treatment to resolve the identiﬁed is-
sues. First, we propose to parameterize the approximated
posterior of instance embedding as a marginal von Mises-
Fisher distribution to account for the interference of distri-
butional latent bias. Then, we incorporate a suite of critical
geometric properties to impose proper constraints on the
layout of constructed embedding space, which in turn min-
imizes the uncontrollable risk for unknown class learning
and structuring. Furthermore, a spectral graph-theoretic
method is devised to estimate the number of potential novel
classes. It inherits two intriguing merits compared to exis-
tent approaches, namely high computational efﬁciency and
ﬂexibility for taxonomy-adaptive estimation. Extensive ex-
periments across various biomedical scenarios substantiate
the effectiveness and general applicability of our method.
1. Introduction
The rapid progress in deep learning (DL) has invigo-
rated enormous interests for automating essential stages in
biomedical image analysis through data-driven methodolo-
gies [7, 42]. However, the transformative potential of DL
to facilitate scientiﬁc discovery at the fundamental level re-
mains largely untapped. Speciﬁcally, the success of ex-
isting works hinges on expert-curated data annotations in

biomedical domain, violation of the i.i.d. assumption incurred
by inconsistent imaging protocols across cohorts and non-uniform
class distributions due to scarcity of rare classes could deterio-
rate the generalizability of learned representations for novel class
discovery. We propose to address those issues via probabilistic
modeling on a hyperspherical manifold and incorporation of ge-
ometrical inductive biases for countering semantic ambiguity and
open space risk.
which associated biomedical structures (e.g., cells, tissues)
and disease categories are deﬁned a priori [30, 13]. They
have little to offer for exploring unknown concepts and dis-
covering expressive proﬁles for novel/undeﬁned biomedi-
cal phenotypes from observational data alone. For instance,
cell, the basic unit of human biological system, exhibits
vast diversity with hundreds of different types and states
[33]. Compared with cumbersome manual pattern identiﬁ-
cation and grouping of cell populations, autonomously min-
ing new classes of cells with their morphological and func-
tional characteristics could greatly speed up the scientiﬁc
discovery progress of biomedical research.
To this end, we study the problem of discovering novel
concepts from biomedical imaging data, under the Gener-
alized Novel Class Discovery setting [44]. Given a refer-
ence dataset within a set of well-deﬁned base categories,

it aims at identifying and clustering unseen classes in an
external collection of image instances without supervision
[22, 20]. The technical challenge of this task lies in how to
leverage the structured prior knowledge secured from previ-
ously known biomedical object categories to guide the un-
supervised discovery of new concepts. Recently, a stream
of methods based on representation learning and cluster-
ing [16, 21, 44] have been proposed to detect unseen ob-
jects in generic visual perception scenes. However, the
basic assumption those works built upon may not hold in
the biomedical domain from two aspects: i)It is generally
assumed that the labeled and unlabeled data are indepen-
dent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) [53, 23], whereas for
biomedical images, data distribution shifts inevitably arise
from the variations in targeted biology and image acquisi-
tion among multiple cohorts [32, 14]. The statistical dis-
crepancy between the reference set of data and the external
collection for discovery would consequently result in am-
biguous semantic representations given the interference of
task-irrelevant attributes [31]. ii)Existing works hypothe-
size a balanced class distribution a priori which expects that
the quantity and occurrence frequency of unseen classes
should be on par with the base classes [8, 52]. They dis-
miss the long-tail nature of class distribution in scientiﬁc
discovery that instances of classes never seen before are es-
sentially rare and hard to collect. For instance, rare dis-
eases are inherently atypical and much fewer in caseload
than their common counterpart [9, 34]. The formulated em-
bedding space is consequently prone to be biased towards
the base classes with dominatedly copious training samples.
Despite the latest efforts delivering explicit modeling of the
distribution biases [50, 48], their self-training founded so-
lutions intrinsically fall short due to erratic representation
space structuring. Without consideration of the dark infor-
mation [6] regarding unknown class representations, there is
no guarantee that a structured open space can be preserved
for learning new classes. It deteriorates the generalizability
of those methods to uncover and group the implicit patterns
of unseen phenotypes.
In this work, we present a geometry-constrained proba-
bilistic treatment for discovering novel biomedical classes
which resolves the above-mentioned challenges from a new
perspective, as illustrated in Fig. 1. First, to counteract the
semantic ambiguities induced by data distribution shifts,
we suggest to circumvent deterministic image encoding
and instead model latent representations as directional dis-
tributions. Speciﬁcally, for each instance, we parameter-
ize the approximated posterior of its semantic embedding
with a marginal von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on
a unit hyperspherical manifold. The probabilistic model-
ing presents an elegant solution to decouple latent bias in-
curred by inconsistent imaging protocols from informative
semantic context as an implicit uncertainty measure. Sec-ond, we pinpoint the necessity to incorporate inductive bi-
ases for imposing proper constraints on the geometric lay-
out of learned embedding space and thereby minimizing
the uncontrollable risk for unknown classes. Aside from
thehyperspherical manifold prior, we identify two critical
geometric properties for embedding space structuring, i.e.,
boundness anduniformity . Here, boundness implies that,
in the latent space, both base and novel classes should be
limited to their certain bounded ranges with a large mar-
gin separation between the two groups. Uniformity refers
to the degree of distributional diversity for the set of se-
mantic proxies on the hypersphere. These principles co-
operatively shape the layout of embedding space towards
risk-bounded novel class discovery and perspicuous geo-
metric interpretation. With explicit constraints to integrate
the underlined inductive biases into representation learning,
our proposed method inherits guarantees to attain maximal
inter-class separability and intra-class compactness, which
in turn addresses the inordinate dominance of base classes
and favors the generalization of learned embeddings to rec-
ognize unseen concepts.
Additionally, with respect to the practice of existing
works assuming the number of novel classes are known
a priori [54, 29], we argue that such supposition is over-
optimistic and unrealistic in the open world of scientiﬁc dis-
covery. We therefore propose a versatile and plug-and-play
solution to estimate the number of categories in unlabeled
data. The spectral graph theory-based approach is computa-
tionally efﬁcient and does not introduce recursive clustering
as in [44]. It also holds an appealing merit that it supports
taxonomy-adaptive estimation, which means the users can
decide the granularity level (e.g., coarse or ﬁne-grained) in
class hierarchy with regards to their speciﬁc needs and get
the corresponding outcome.
Contributions. Our contributions are four-fold: (i)We
introduce a novel paradigm to unleash the tremendous
promise of DL to facilitate data-driven biomedical dis-
covery and account for the distribution biases inher-
ently presented in the domain. (ii)We propose geometry-
constrained probabilistic modeling to facilitate risk-
bounded novel class discovery by exploiting the boundness
anduniformity geometrical inductive biases for representa-
tion space structuring. We perform theoretical justiﬁcations
from two perspectives to illustrate the merits of our method.
(iii)We devise a spectral graph-theoretic method to esti-
mate the potential number of novel classes in unlabeled ob-
servational data. (iv)The proposed method is extensively
validated on a diverse suite of challenging scenarios and at-
tains superior performance compared to existing solutions.
2. Related Works
Novel Class Discovery. Inspired by the observation that
human visual system can effortlessly recognize an unseen
11525
class of objects based on previously learnt category con-
cepts, a stream of methods have been proposed for novel
class discovery (NCD) in an unsupervised manner by trans-
ferring prior knowledge gathered from a set of seen cate-
gories with annotations [22, 20, 21]. Follow-up works fur-
ther identify the limitations of NCD in that it disregards the
compositional nature of real-world upcoming data and sup-
poses encountered classes will not appear again in the unla-
beled set. To this end, they formalize the Generalized Novel
Class Discovery (GNCD) setting which assumes both base
and novel classes could simultaneously appear in the un-
labeled data [44]. ComEx [49] and DPN [1] propose to
decouple the two sets of categories for capturing discrim-
inative representations. In a similar spirit, PromptCAL [51]
and DCCL [36] resort to synergistic learning and seek to im-
prove the constructed representations via auxiliary training
objectives. Nevertheless, those works are rooted in over-
optimistic assumptions of i.i.d. data and balanced class
distribution [44] and thereby tend to suffer from severe
learning bias in real-world scientiﬁc discovery with intri-
cate circumstances. Despite the recent efforts to account for
non-i.i.d. and non-uniform data distribution in consonance
with NCD [50, 48], their solutions are limited to the com-
monly adopted self-training scheme. Without explicit regu-
larizations imposed on the geometric layout structure of the
embedding space, their performance could ﬂuctuate vastly
given the volatile quality of pseudo-labels [46].
Open-World Semi-Supervised Learning. The technical
challenge we intend to unravel is in line with an arising
topic, i.e., open-world semi-supervised learning [3]. It takes
a step further than the closed-world setting held in stan-
dard semi-supervised learning and presumes the emergence
of new classes in unlabeled training and test dataset. Fol-
lowing the insight, several recent works suggest the usage
of pseudo-labels and pair-wise similarity to group and rec-
ognize unseen categories [37, 4, 38, 19]. However, their
promise in biomedical scientiﬁc discovery is unfavorably
undermined by the challenges posed by distribution bias.
von Mises-Fisher Distribution. Probabilistic representa-
tion learning provides an elegant viewpoint to measure pre-
dictive uncertainty and mitigate feature ambiguity arising
from deterministic mappings [41]. The multivariate Gaus-
sian distribution is commonly employed as a prominent
choice for probabilistic modeling in Euclidean space, whilst
its applicability on spherical embeddings is limited due to
inherent conﬂicts with the underlying manifold geometry
[11]. On the contrary, the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distri-
bution is introduced as a directional statistical model that
is deﬁned on the hypersphere. It has been applied in tasks
including facial recognition [27, 47], out-of-distribution de-
tection [35], and long-tailed learning [45], leading to re-
markable advancements in these areas. Nevertheless, the
signiﬁcance of incorporating crucial inductive biases per-taining to geometric properties within the embedding space,
such as uniformity, has been overlooked in the literature.
Distinguished from existing works, to the best of our knowl-
edge, our study is the ﬁrst to explicitly structure the geo-
metric layout of learned representations and account for the
statistical discrepancy across data with distributional con-
centration modeling.
3. Methodology
3.1. Problem Statement
The objective of this study is to achieve automated dis-
covery of clusters that correspond to novel concepts us-
ing observational data, which is accomplished by trans-
ferring the knowledge acquired from a set of base classes
with labeled image samples. Following the practical set-
ting in [44], we assume that there exists a labeled base set
DB=f(xi;yi)gNB
i=12 XBYB, and an unlabeled set
DU=f(xi;yi)gNU
i=12 XUYUwith potential novel
classes, whereYUare not available. All instances in DBare
of class setSB. As base classes also appear in the unlabeled
set, i.e.,YBYU, the set of novel classes to be discovered
can be formulated as SN=YUnYB, with the total number
jSNjunknown a priori. Notably, distinguished from [44],
the two sets of data are drawn from different distributions
due to inconsistent biology processing and imaging proto-
cols, i.e.,XBPB;XUPU;PB6=PU. The class distri-
bution ofDUis innately non-uniform as well. Given a new
instance fromPU, the goal is to either recognize it as one of
the base classes or ﬁnd it is closest to which identiﬁed novel
class amongstSN.
3.2. Geometry-Constrained Probabilistic Modeling
Overview. The technical challenge to adapt base knowl-
edge for novel biomedical concept discovery lies in two as-
pects: semantic ambiguity caused by data distribution shifts
and uncontrollable open space risk as a result of major class
dominance. To this end, we propose a novel geometry-
constrained probabilistic treatment. The framework is illus-
trated in Fig. 2. It explicitly decouples the underlying distri-
butional bias from informative semantic representations and
structures the geometric layout of the formulated embed-
ding space based upon inductive biases on latent manifold.
First, we incorporate the uniformity inductive bias by posi-
tioning semantic proxies a priori with uniform distribution
guarantees. It helps to mitigate the representation collapse
incurred by the inherent imbalance between base and novel
classes. Subsequently, we leverage vMF probabilistic mod-
eling to promote latent space boundness by ﬁrstly establish-
ing a compact manifold for each base class and then regu-
larizing the open space to be separated from the base man-
ifold by a large angular margin. At last, to demystify the
dark information regarding unknown class representations,
11526
Figure 2. Overview of the proposed method. We propose to incor-
porate the uniformity andboundness geometrical inductive biases
by establishing preorganized proxies as anchors and then structur-
ing the geometric layout of learned embedding space successively
with hyperspherical probabilistic modeling.
we propose to structure the embedding space and minimize
the open space risk by imposing statistical discrepancy con-
straints on unlabeled instances with semantic consensus.
Uniform Proxies Founded A Priori with Energy Min-
imization. Prior to representation learning, we propose
to at ﬁrst organize the embedding space with pre-deﬁned
proxies. By disentangling proxy foundation as an individual
step, we seamlessly integrate the uniformity inductive bias
to shape model output space without disturbing discrimina-
tive class learning. Here, uniformity indicates the degree
of distributional diversity for the set of proxies. With the
proxies distributed uniformly throughout the entire mani-
fold, we minimize the open space risk by explicitly struc-
turing the feature space for unknown classes. The equidis-
tributional organization also facilitates inter-class separa-
tion and intra-class compactness. Speciﬁcally, given a d-
dimensional embedding space, we deﬁne a set of prior prox-
ies^=f^1;:::;^ng2Sd 1on a unit hyperspherical man-
ifold. The number of proxies nshould be generally larger
than the total number of classes. We then propose to char-
acterize the distributional uniformity of those proxies with
their hyperspherical potential energy [39]. Energy behaves
as a measure of distribution redundancy where lower energy
implies the proxies are evenly positioned with large margin
separation. We thereby suggest to minimize the potential
energy with the following objective:
arg min
f^1;:::;^ng2Sd 1Es;d(^ijn
i=1) =nX
i=1nX
j=1;j6=is;d(^i;^j);
(1)
where the unit hypersphere Sd 1=f^2Rdjk^k= 1g.
s;d(;)represents the measurement of the correlation be-
tween proxies, which is typically implemented with the fol-lowing Riesz s-kernel function:
s;d(^i;^j) :=(
 (^i;^j) s; s> 0;
log( ( ^i;^j) 1); s= 0;(2)
where  (;)is deﬁned as the hyperspherical geodesic dis-
tance.
Distributional Characterization on Hypersphere. To ac-
count for the semantic ambiguities induced by data distri-
bution shifts, we propose probabilistic modeling to param-
eterize latent embeddings as directional distributions on a
hyperspherical manifold. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst let frep-
resent a projection network that maps input images to their
hyperspherical embedding, i.e., f:x2X7!z2Sd 1.
Then, we characterize the approximated posterior of each
instance embedding as a marginal von Mises-Fisher (vMF)
distribution, i.e., q(zjx)vMF (~x;~x). Formally, a
vMF distribution is deﬁned as:
q(zj~x;~x) =Cd(~x) exp( ~x~T
xz); (3)
Cd(~x) =~d=2 1
x
(2)d=2Id=2 1(~x); (4)
whereId=2 1()denotes the modiﬁed Bessel function of
the ﬁrst kind at order (d=2 1).~xand~xare statistical
parameters representing the direction and concentration of
the distribution. With this formulation, the discriminative
semantic context can be derived from the directional place-
ment on the hypersphere and hence get decoupled from
task-irrelevant variational attributes. Besides, the concen-
tration parameter ~xprovides an intuitive measurement of
semantic embedding ambiguity [40] and can therefore act
as an instance-wise temperature factor. It adaptively scales
the contributions of different image samples based on their
representation uncertainty to deliver dynamic rectiﬁcations
on the latent space structuring procedure, which is theoreti-
cally analyzed afterwards.
Base Space Bounding and Open Space Dispersion. With
the modeled probabilistic representations, the subsequent
objective is to organically structure the geometric layout
of embedding space for discriminative novel class discov-
ery. Ideally, the space covered by well-deﬁned base cate-
gories should be bounded within a certain range while the
unknown classes corresponding to the open space should
be modeled apart from the periphery of base space and dis-
persed over the entire manifold [6]. We therefore propose
to leverage the pre-deﬁned proxies to bound the base space
and keep the open space isolated. For each base class, we
select one proxy as the class anchor and reformulate it with
Dirac deltato derive a statistical modeling over its deter-
11527
ministic representation:
(z) :=8
>><
>>:Z
Sd 1(z ^B)dz= 1;
Z
Sd 1(z ^B)(z)dz=(^B):(5)
Here^Bdenotes the ﬁxed positional values of the proxies
for base classes. It is noted that the selection of proxies is
random since they have been forced to be uniformly dis-
tributed on a symmetric manifold and all proxy pairs have
the same distance. Then, the proxies can behave as desired
latent priors to regularize the distribution of base classes.
Speciﬁcally, the optimization objective is to enforce the
instance-wise vMF distribution q(zj~x;~x)approximating
the latent prior (z)in terms of KL divergence:
min
qEDB[ (Z
Sd 1(z) logq(zj~x;~x)dz) H (z)];
(6)
whereH(z)denotes the differential entropy over (z),
which is a constant as (z)is ﬁxed a priori. Combined
with Eq. (3)-(5), the objective is equivalent to minimizing
the following loss function:
LB(~x;~x) = Z
Sd 1[~x~T
xz+ logCd(~x)](z)dz
= ~x~T
x^B (d=2 1) log ~x+ logId=2 1(~x) + ;
(7)
where = (d=2) log 2is a constant constituent. The
regularization term constrains the intra-class variability and
shrinks the base space within a bounded radius. There-
after, we propose open space dispersion aimed at separat-
ing the space reserved for novel classes away from the base
one. The challenging aspect is how to recognize the un-
seen concepts from the hybrid unlabeled set of data where
base and novel classes concurrently exist. In this regard, we
ﬁrst derive the magnitude of probabilistic deviation as an
indication of open-set instances and hereby enforce large
angular margins between those embeddings and the base
space. Speciﬁcally, we measure the probability density of
each instance-wise vMF distribution with respect to base
class proxies and estimate the ranking over XU:
argsort
fx1;:::;xNUg2XUn
max
f^Bi;8i2SBgCd(~x) exp( ~x~T
x^Bi)o
:
(8)
The batch-wise instances with maximal divergence from the
base class proxies are hereafter pushed towards the open
space:
Ldis(~x;~x) = logexp(~x~T
x^R)
exp(~x~Tx^R) + exp( ~x~Tx^B);
(9)
where ^R=^n^Bdenotes the remaining proxies located
outside of the base space. The optimization objectives ofEq. (7) and (9) cooperatively promote boundness on the un-
derlying manifold. We then propose to explicitly introduce
theuniformity inductive bias and accordingly structure
the open space to control its associated risk, which in turn
appreciates the generalizability of learned representations
for recognizing unseen concepts.
Open Space Structuring. The dark information in the
unknown space which has not been properly character-
ized raises uncontrollable risks for novel classes learn-
ing and discrimination [6]. To this end, we propose to
structure the open space organically with proxy-driven se-
mantic consensus, which encourages the constructed em-
beddings to be uniformly distributed over the manifold
with semantically-meaningful clusters such that the repre-
sentations of different novel classes can be spaced apart
with large angular distance. Our intuition is that in-
stances with adjacent geometric placements on the un-
derlying manifold should possess analogous semantics
and exhibit marginal distributional discrepancy. Specif-
ically, given each pair of unlabeled instances (x;x)
and corresponding probabilistic modeling q(zjx)
vMF (~x;~x);q(zjx)vMF (~x;~x), we
measure their distributional overlaps with all pre-set prox-
ies asO^
(;)=fCd(~x) exp( ~x~T
x^i);8^i2^;x2
(x;x)g, which indicate the statistical distances between
instance embeddings and proxies. Since the proxies have
been priorly positioned covering the entire manifold with
uniformity guarantees, the derived O^
andO^
can com-
prehensively characterize the geometric location of instance
embeddings. As such, we suggest xis semantically cor-
related withxand their distributional discrepancy should
be minor ifO^
:=O^
. Formally, the condition holds true
ifarg max topk(O^
) =arg max topk(O^
). LetGdenote the
collection of instance pairs satisfying the above condition.
In these cases, we aim at minimizing the discrepancy be-
tween the two vMF distributions to escalate their semantic
afﬁnities. We resort to modeling the distributional discrep-
ancy with KL divergence and accordingly derive the follow-
ing optimization objective:
min
qEG[ Z
Sd 1q(zj~x;~x) log(q(zj~x;~x)
q(zj~x;~x))dz]:
(10)
Combined with Eq. (3) and (4), we can derive the corre-
sponding regularization term as follows:
Lstr(~x;~x;~x;~x) = [Id=2(~x)
Id=2 1(~x)
(~x ~x~x~T
x) + log(Cd(~x)
Cd(~x)) + 1] 1:(11)
The constraints advocate explicit associations between the
geometric layout of embedding manifold and the semantic
11528
representations of instances, which in turn systematically
structure the open space. By integrating the optimization
objective along with the ones in Eq. (7) and (9), we jointly
incorporate the boundness anduniformity inductive biases
to shape the learned embedding space and thereby favor its
generalization to unseen biomedical concepts.
3.3. Spectral-Based Class Number Estimation
With the well-structured embedding space, the subse-
quent target is to estimate the number of classes in unlabeled
data and accordingly perform clustering to assign class label
for each instance in DU. Different from previous methods
counting on the results of empirical evaluations and intro-
ducing costly recursive clustering [44], we propose a spec-
tral graph-theoretic approach based upon the ﬁnding that the
eigenvalues of graph Laplacians inherently characterize the
underlying connectivity of the latent manifold [15]. Specif-
ically, we construct a weighted graph over all instances of
DU, in which each node corresponds to the embedding zi
of a data point, and the edge weights Wmodel the correla-
tions between pairs of instances as fzizT
jg. Letdenote
the diagonal matrix with the row-wise sum of Was its en-
tries, the optimization objective for graph partitioning with
minimized energy is:
min
hhT 1=2( W) 1=2h
hTh; (12)
which is equivalent to solve  1=2( W) 1=2h=
h. The results can be intrinsically depicted by the eigen-
vectors of the normalized graph Laplacian  1=2( 
W) 1=2[2]. In this regard, the eigenvectors can behave
as soft segments to partition the overall graph into a set
of semantically-meaningful splits, while the corresponding
eigenvalues can be considered as indicators for the inner-
connectivity of potential clusters. In other words, instances
in splits with higher eigenvalues exhibit stronger internal
semantic afﬁnities and are more plausible to be assigned
into the same class. We therefore propose to estimate the
number of latent classes according to the spectral property
of constructed graph that we rank all possible graph splits
with their associated eigenvalues and identify the split index
which corresponds to the largest gap within the ordering
of eigenvalue differences fargsort diff (eigenvalues )g.
The identiﬁed index suggests the start of graph splits which
contain limited inner-connectivity and should not be con-
sidered as individual classes. The index is thereby modeled
as the estimated number of classes. We then perform k-
means clustering over DUin the hyperspherical space with
the estimated class number for label assignment. Notably,
taxonomy-adaptive estimation could be in demand that it is
required to gauge the number of potential ﬁne-grained sub-
classes. Our method is well suited for this scenario as it can
be adapted to estimate the inherent subclasses by looseningthe above condition and instead indexing the subordinately
largest eigenvalue gap according to the speciﬁc need in class
hierarchy.
3.4. Theoretical Analysis
In this section, we motivate our method theoretically and
provide analytical insights to validate its merits.
Monotonicity between Distributional Concentration
and Semantic Ambiguity. With the intrinsic semantic
ambiguity present in biomedical visual data due to dis-
parate imaging protocols across cohorts, our probabilistic
treatment, which advocates for vMF statistical modeling,
adeptly characterizes the ambiguous attributes with distri-
butional concentration ~:
Proposition 1 Letxbe the continuous entropy of the pos-
terior vMF distribution parametrized by ~x2Sd 1and
~x2Rd
>0. We havex(~x)behave as a monotonically
decreasing function in the interval (0;+1).
It suggests the statistical parameter ~xessentially measures
the aleatoric uncertainty of the semantic context in data
pointx. Combined with the analysis of ~xon distributional
regularization terms, as presented in the supplementary ma-
terial, it is demonstrated the probabilistic modeling dynam-
ically calibrates the biased learning procedure towards dis-
criminative contextual information modeling.
Towards Bounded Open Space Risk with Uniform Prox-
ies. The most challenging aspect in the GNCD problem is
how to demystify the dark information regarding unknown
class representations in order to restrain the associated open
space risk [36]. We hereby prove the effectiveness of our
proposed method towards a tighter error bound for open
space risk characterization and regularization. Details can
be found in the supplemental material.
4. Experiments
4.1. Experimental Setup
Datasets. To evaluate the effectiveness and general ap-
plicability of our method under miscellaneous biomedical
discovery scenarios, we conduct experiments on a diverse
suite of challenging tasks encompassing various biomedi-
cal concepts (cell, lesion, disease), imaging modalities (X-
ray, microscopy, dermatoscopy, fundus photography), and
pathologies (lung infection, skin cancer, eye complication).
For each task, we adopt two different datasets with evident
data distribution shifts to serve as the labeled base set and
the unlabeled set comprising novel classes, respectively. In
speciﬁc, we consider the discovery of novel types or de-
grees of pneumonia infectious organisms [25, 10], cell nu-
clei [17, 18], skin lesions [43, 9], and diabetic retinopa-
thy severity [28, 24]. The quantity of instances belong-
ing to novel classes is inherently much smaller compared

with their base counterpart and naturally formalize the long-
tailed class distribution. More details can be found in the
supplemental material, where extended studies on general
concept discovery are further presented and analyzed.
Implementation Details and Evaluation Protocol. We
adopt the ViT-B/16 [12] with DINO pre-trained weights [5]
as the backbone network for fair comparisons with the pre-
vious methods [44, 36]. Its output of [CLS]token with a
dimension of 768 is used for latent embedding. Please refer
to the attached code for details.
For evaluation, we measure the clustering accuracy be-
tween the predicted class assignment and the ground-truth
label. Following the protocol in [44], we match the two
class sets by searching for the optimal permutation using the
Hungarian assignment algorithm [26]. We adopt the accu-
racy and F1 scores as metrics and report the averaged score
across the entire class set. Particularly, we also present the
scores speciﬁc to the base known SBand novelSNsubset
of classes in a separated manner.
4.2. Results and Discussions
Main Results. We compare our method with state-of-the-
art approaches for novel class discovery (NCD), including
RankStats+ [21], UNO+ [16], GCD [44], and DCCL [36]
which are speciﬁcally devised for the challenging gener-
alized NCD setting, as well as SLF [50] and BYOP [48]
which take account of the non-i.i.d. data and non-uniform

label distribution issues, respectively. The overall quantita-
tive results over four diverse biomedical concept discovery
tasks are presented in Table 1 and 2. All methods are im-
plemented based upon the same ViT-B/16 backbone with
DINO pre-trained weights [44]. It can be observed that our
proposed method consistently and signiﬁcantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art novel class discovery approaches over
all four tasks. Notably, as highlighted in the gray columns
which correspond to the clustering metrics speciﬁc to novel
classes, our method surpasses the comparison approaches
by a substantial margin especially on the identiﬁcation and
grouping of unseen phenotypes. The results demonstrate
the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed geometry-

constrained probabilistic modeling for discovering novel
concepts despite the data and label distribution biases in-
trinsically present in the biomedical domain.
We further assess the efﬁcacy of the spectral-based class
number estimation method, as presented in Fig. 3. The pro-
posed approach attains promising results that the estimated
number is identical or very close to the ground-truth value.
The versatile method also holds an appealing merit that it
supports taxonomy-adaptive estimation, which means it is
capable of estimating the number of potential ﬁne-grained
subclasses, a practical aspect not previously considered in
the literature at all. Additionally, it is noteworthy that our
method does not rely on recursive clustering as in [44] and
is therefore computationally efﬁcient. On the pneumonia
benchmark, our method only takes 0.121s , which is more
than10faster than the comparison approach [44] con-
suming 2.854s .
Ablation of Key Components. Table 3 presents the ab-
lation study results to demonstrate the effectiveness of key
components in our proposed method. It can be remarked
that each component is indispensable and holds a positive
impact on novel class discovery. Notably, the combina-
tion of pre-deﬁned uniform proxies and base space bound-
ing reaches the peak accuracy in terms of F1-known on the
pneumonia infectious organism benchmark. However, it
suffers from inferior efﬁcacy in identifying and clustering
potential novel concepts. The observation is in line with our
argument that the consideration and explicit modeling of
the dark information regarding unknown classes are crucial
to ensure the generalizability of learned representations for
discovering unseen concepts. Solely imposing constraints
on the base space is insufﬁcient to calibrate the learning
process biased towards the dominant known classes. In con-
trast, our method proposes two supplementary geometric
constraints which cooperatively shape the layout of embed-
ding space and compensate for the open space risk, which in
turn leads to unbiased and discriminative modeling of novel
class representations.

perspicuously illustrate the effectiveness of our method to-

wards shaping the geometric structure of embedding space,
we visualize the learned representations on the 3D spherical
manifold and its associated probabilistic characterizations,
as shown in Fig. 4. The covariance structure of data points
is modeled as a group of super-level-set ellipses to indicate
the uncertainty of constructed clusters. We observe that the
removal of open space dispersion and structuring inevitably
deteriorates the degree of inter-class angular separation and
results in ambiguous semantic representations. The com-
parative analysis between the two variants of our proposed
method substantiates the signiﬁcance of incorporating geo-
metric inductive biases to regulate the underlying organiza-
tion of the embedding space.
5. Conclusion
In this work, we propose a geometry-constrained proba-
bilistic modeling framework to address challenging aspects
of novel class discovery in the biomedical domain. Speciﬁ-
cally, we suggest to model the latent representation of each
instance as a directional distribution to exclude the task-
irrelevant data variations arising from inconsistent imaging
protocols across cohorts. We then identify several geomet-
ric properties critical for organic embedding space struc-
turing. By explicitly integrating those principles to reg-
ularize representation layout, the open space risk associ-
ated with the discovery of novel classes can be effectively
bounded. Additionally, a spectral graph-theoretic algorithm
is developed to estimate the number of categories in unla-
beled data, which inherits taxonomy adaptivity and high ef-
ﬁciency. Our method exhibits appealing performance on
a diverse suite of novel concept discovery applications in
biomedical domains.
