Abstract
The increased demand for 3D data in AR/VR, robotics
and gaming applications, gave rise to powerful generative
pipelines capable of synthesizing high-quality 3D objects.
Most of these models rely on the Score Distillation Sampling
(SDS) algorithm to optimize a 3D representation such that
the rendered image maintains a high likelihood as evaluated
by a pre-trained diffusion model. However, finding a correct
mode in the high-dimensional distribution produced by the
diffusion model is challenging and often leads to issues such
as over-saturation, over-smoothing, and Janus-like artifacts.
In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm for 3D
synthesis that utilizes pre-trained diffusion models. Instead
of focusing on mode-seeking, our method directly models
the distribution discrepancy between multi-view renderings
and diffusion priors in an adversarial manner, which unlocks
the generation of high-fidelity and photorealistic 3D content,
conditioned on a single image and prompt. Moreover, by

ity of our pipeline compared to previous works in terms of
generation quality and diversity.
1. Introduction
In recent years, we have witnessed an unprecedented ex-
plosion in generative models that can synthesize intelligi-
ble text [ 12,83,109], photorealistic images [ 50,57,69,
79,89,90,92,92,94,110,115,125], video sequences
[6,16,101,102,111], music [ 3,9,24] and 3D data
[14,15,27,34,46,60,67,78,85,107,116,124,130–
132,135]. In particular, when dealing with 3D data, manu-
ally creating them is a laborious endeavor that necessitates
technical skills from highly experienced designers. There-
fore, having systems capable of automatically generating
realistic and diverse 3D contents could significantly facili-
tate the workflow of artists and product designers and could

enable new levels of creativity through “generative art” [8].
Recently diffusion models [ 40,105,106] have emerged
as a powerful class of tools that can produce photorealistic
images conditioned on versatile user inputs [ 90,92,93,132]
such as text, depth maps, semantic masks etc. However,
naively adopting them on 3D synthesis tasks is not trivial,
due to the lack of large-scale, richly annotated 3D datasets.
Despite the recently introduced larger 3D datasets [ 21,120],
they remain significantly smaller compared to contemporary
image-text datasets that typically contain billions of exam-
ples. Therefore, a large body of works [ 15,60,85,117]
explored using pre-trained 2D text-to-image diffusion mod-
els [92,93] to generate 3D data. Among the first works
was DreamFusion [ 85] that introduced the Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) algorithm for learning a 3D representation,
such that the rendered image from any view looks similar
(i.e. has high likelihood) to a sample from the pre-trained 2D
diffusion model, given a text description.
Despite their impressive performance [ 15,58,60,72,
114], SDS-based arts frequently exhibit issues such as over-
saturation, over-smoothness, non-photorealism, and limited
diversity, primarily attributed to the quality degradation of
mode-seeking behaviors in deep generative models [ 74]. To
alleviate these drawbacks, in a concurrent work, Wang et al.
introduced Variational Score Distillation (VSD) [ 117], which
is a generalized version of SDS that aims to optimize a 3D
distribution to approximate the distribution defined by the
diffusion model. While VSD [ 117] addressed some issues of
SDS, its rendering quality still suffers from highly saturated
colors hence resulting in less photorealistic generations.
In this paper, we propose Consistent Adversarial Distil-
lation (CAD), a new approach for generating 3D objects
conditioned on a text prompt and a single image, to over-
come the mentioned issues. Instead of optimizing a single
NeRF through score distillation, our key idea is to train a 3D
generator that directly models the conditional distribution
of a pre-trained diffusion model, through adversarial learn-
ing. Although modeling the distribution of generic concepts
with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [ 30] may be
challenging, utilizing input conditions such as text or images
could effectively constrain the data distribution, since the 3D
objects following specific conditions should share similar
scale, shape and appearance in the canonical space, which
GANs could handle pretty well [ 14,17,39,80,95]. More-
over, as the generator learns a mapping from the latent to the
continuous 3D distribution, our model becomes applicable
to various downstream tasks, including diversified sampling,
single-view reconstruction and 3D interpolation (see Fig. 1).
However, distilling prior knowledge from a pre-trained
diffusion model into a 3D GAN is not trivial. Existing
attempts typically rely on large amount of high-quality
and aligned data [ 13,80,95,100,103,119] with evenly-
distributed poses [ 13,14,31,95,104,121]. When samplingnovel images from a pre-trained 2D diffusion model, there is
no guarantee that the data distribution will adequately cover
all azimuth angles that fully define the shape’s geometry. On
the contrary, due to the existing inductive bias of the diffu-
sion model, it is more likely to produce frontal-facing data,
even after using prompt engineering or negative prompts.
We resolve this by leveraging the view-dependent diffusion
model of [64] and further propose several distribution prun-
ing and refinement strategies that ensure stable training as
well as diverse and high-quality samples. Finally, we employ
a 3D-aware GAN [ 14] to learn a 3D generator that models
the conditional distribution of a pre-trained diffusion model.
We evaluate our model on several datasets and showcase that
it can generate high-quality, diverse and photorealistic 3D
objects conditioned on a single image and a text prompt.
2. Related Work
3D Generative Models. Over the years, several works ex-
plored combining generative models [ 30,40,53,91,105]
with different 3D representations such as voxel grids [ 26,
39,44,66,119], meshes [ 28,29,75,134], point clouds
[2,88,122,127] or neural implicits [ 19,54,128,129]. Al-
though most of these pipelines can generate plausible 3D
geometries, they require explicit 3D supervision. To this end,
many works investigated learning the 3D scene geometry
and appearance through volumetric [ 73,82,123] and dif-
ferentiable rendering [ 59,112,134]. The key advantage of
these pipelines is that they can recover 3D information only
from images. In this work, we introduce a model capable of
generating high-quality 3D objects conditioned on a single
image and a text prompt, hence effectively alleviating the
need for both 3D data and multi-view images during training.
3D-Aware Generative Models. GANs [ 30] have demon-
strated impressive capabilities on several image synthesis
[10,20,48,50] and editing [ 4,11,20,45,61,98,113] tasks.
However, adopting them to 3D data is non-trivial as they
ignore the physics of the image formation process, hence
failing to produce 3D consistent renderings. To address
this, several works [ 23,31,35,37,38,70,76,77,81,136]
explored incorporating explicit 3D representations or com-
bining GANs [ 13,14,95,103] with Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRFs) [ 73]. Due to their compelling results, var-
ious follow-up works further improved various aspects
of the synthesis process such as the rendering quality
[14,31,96,103,121] , the underlying geometry [ 84,99],
the editing capabilities [ 36,52,55,65,80,108,126]. Our
generator architecture is similar to EG3D [ 14], however our
training pipeline that leverages 2D diffusion priors is novel
and enables the generation of objects from arbitrary cate-
gories based on textual descriptions and image guidance.

minimizing the distribution gap between pG(x∣z,c)andp0(x0∣y). For brevity, we omit some details of the triplane generator training.
Our method could effectively overcome the issues of score distillation and achieve highly photorealistic and diverse 3D generation.
text-to-image diffusion models [ 42,79,90,92,93] for gen-
erating 3D data. DreamFusion [ 85] was among the first that
proposed to distill a pre-trained diffusion model [ 93] into a
NeRF [ 73] for text-guided 3D synthesis. In particular, the
objective was to ensure that the rendered images, would
match the distribution of the sampled photorealistic images
conditioned on a specific text prompt. This process of sam-
pling through optimization is referred to as Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS). However, naively applying SDS for 3D
synthesis poses several challenges such as over-smoothing,
saturated colors as well as Janus-like issues. Concurrently,
ProlificDreamer [ 117] proposed to address these issues with
Variational Score Distillation (VSD). The key difference be-
tween SDS and VSD is that the latter treats a 3D scene as a
random variable, as opposed to a single data point. While
[117] addresses some of the issues of SDS, it still suffers
from over-saturated colors. In contrast, our work mitigates
these challenges by training a 3D-aware generator that di-
rectly models the distribution of a diffusion model.
Our work is related to approaches that generate 3D ob-
jects conditioned on a single input image. Among the first
works in this direction were [ 5,32,47,118,137] that pro-
posed training a 3D-aware diffusion model for novel view
synthesis. Despite their competitive results, they could only
be evaluated on objects from categories seen during train-
ing. To mitigate this, an alternative line of research explored
using pre-trained 2D diffusion models [ 22,68]. To learn con-
trol over the camera viewpoint, recently, Zero-1-to-3 [ 64]
fine-tuned a pre-trained image-to-text diffusion model [ 92]
on synthetic data [ 21]. In a follow-up work, One-2-3-45 [ 63]
employed the view-dependent diffusion priors of [ 64] to
train a multi-view 3D reconstruction pipeline to enable faster
inference. Similar to our work Magic123 [ 86] uses 2D diffu-
sion together with view-dependent diffusion priors [ 64] for
generating 3D textured meshes from a single image.
3. Method
Given a single image and a text prompt, our goal is to gen-
erate high-quality, photorealistic and diverse 3D content
by distilling pre-trained diffusion models. First, we showhow the concept of continuous distribution modeling avoids
the quality degradation brought by mode-seeking (Sec. 3.1).
Then we introduce CAD, our framework that distills knowl-
edge from pre-trained diffusion models to a 3D GAN with
multi-view consistent rendering (Sec. 3.2). However, due
to the inherent inductive biases embedded in 2D diffusion
models, they tend to only generate images from frontal view-
points and can not describe the full 3D geometry. We further
mitigate this issue by introducing a series of novel strategies
to sample multi-view and diversified data from the condi-
tional distribution of diffusion models (Sec. 3.3).
3.1. Representing 3D Distributions
Preliminaries. We first review prior work that leverages
diffusion priors for 3D generation. Given a pre-trained text-
to-image diffusion model pt(xt∣y)with the noise predic-
tion network ϵpretrain(xt, t, y), SDS [ 85] tries to optimize a
single NeRF [ 73] with parameters θ, s.t. its rendered results
x, given a camera pose csampled from a camera distribution
pc(⋅), could minimize the following objective:
LSDS=Et,c[DKL(qθ
t(xt∣c)∥pt(xt∣y))], (1)
where yis the text prompt and xtis constructed by adding
Gaussian noise ϵtoxaccording to a specific timestep tand
variance schedules. Note that the gradient of Eq. (1) could
be approximated by calculating the noise discrepancy as:
∇θLSDS=∇θEt,ϵ,c[ω(t)∥ϵpretrain(xt, t, y)−ϵ∥2],(2)
where ω(t)is a weighting function. Notably, Eq. (2) resem-
bles the diffusion training loss, thus intuitively SDS could be
explained as optimizing the NeRF renderings to look similar
to samples generated from a pre-trained diffusion model.
The inherent mode-seeking characteristic of SDS [ 85] of-
ten leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this,
VSD [ 117] proposed to replace the single NeRF parametriza-
tionθfrom Eq. (1) with a 3D distribution µ(θ∣y)as follows:
LVSD=Et,c[DKL(qµ
t(xt∣c)∥pt(xt∣y))], (3)
10196
where µ(θ∣y)is parametrized with a set of NeRF instances,
referred to as particles . Additionally, VSD relies on a dy-
namically fine-tuned Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [ 41]
to capture the conditional rendering distribution across dif-
ferent camera poses, thus enabling a similar optimization
framework under the guidance of denoising score.
3D Distribution Modeling. Turning from single NeRF
optimization to distribution modeling is a key for improved
3D synthesis. However, due to the large computation and
memory requirements of VSD [ 117], the number of NeRF
instances that VSD could jointly optimize is quite small
(<10), hence the 3D distribution modeled by [ 117] remains
discrete and unexpressive. In practice, we observe VSD still
suffers from similar issues as SDS to a certain degree.
Instead, we propose to leverage a generator G(z)to
capture the continuous 3D distribution. Considering the
training efficiency and stability, we follow common prac-
tice [ 7,13,27] and implement our generator using a Style-
GAN2 [ 50] backbone paired with triplane features. In par-
ticular, starting from a latent code z∈Rdzdrawn from a
unit Gaussian distribution, our generator network generates
a triplane feature representation Pas follows:
G∶Rdz→R3×N×N×C, G(z)→P, (4)
where N,Ccorrespond to the spatial resolution and channel
size respectively. Note that using a generator to approximate
the conditional distribution of the diffusion model fundamen-
tally resolves mode-seeking issues. Additionally, instead of
learning the triplane features directly from z, the generator
also incorporates a non-linear mapping network, which maps
zto latent vectors w∈W, controlling the generator through
adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) [ 43] at each convo-
lution layer. The intermediate latent space Wshares many
desirable properties, enabling us to perform continuous 3D
interpolation and single-view reconstruction by inversion.
3.2. Consistent Adversarial Distillation
Adversarial Distillation. It should be noted the actual
optimization goal of score distillation is
min
µDKL(qµ
0(x0∣c)∥p0(x0∣y)). (5)
SDS tackles Eq. (5) by breaking it down into multiple sub-
optimization problems, each associated with a unique dif-
fused distribution indexed by t, as indicated in Eq. (1) and
Eq. (3). However, doing optimization using noisy discrep-
ancy can easily lead to noticeable quality degradation in
comparison to the direct denoising sampling approach, as
reported in [85, 117].
To achieve high-quality and diversified generation, we
introduce adversarial distillation shown in Fig. 2, an innova-
tive approach for optimizing the 3D generator G(⋅)s.t. its
sampled data match the samples from a pre-trained diffusion
model, p0(x0∣y), as follows:

where xis the rendered image from triplane P=G(z)
under camera pose c. Instead of directly computing the KL-
D, we solve Eq. (6) by learning an implicit likelihood model,
namely a GAN [ 30]. In particular, we train our model using
an adversarial objective and adopt the non-saturating GAN
loss with R1 regularization [71] from [48] as follows:
LD=Ez∼pz,c∼pc[f(D(R(G(z),c)))]+
EI∼p0[f(−D(I))+λ∥∇D(I)∥2](7)
LG=−Ez∼pz,c∼pc[f(D(R(G(z),c)))], (8)
where f(u)is defined as f(u)=−log(1+exp(−u)),Iis
sampled from the diffusion model, R(⋅)denotes the volu-
metric renderer used to render the generator’s output that
parametrizes the fake data distribution, D(⋅)denotes the
discriminator and λis a hyperparameter.
To render an image, for every coordinate along the camera
ray, we sample features from the triplanes Pand aggregate
them with summation. Next, a light-weight MLP decoder
M(⋅)will explain the aggregated features f∈Rdfinto radi-
ancec∈R3and volume density σ∈R+. We follow common
practice and use volumetric rendering with hierarchical sam-
pling [ 73] to predict the final RGB colors for every pixel in
the image. Unlike score distillation, our distillation scheme
is directly based on high-quality and clean samples drawn
from the diffusion model, which effectively overcomes over-
saturation issues. Furthermore, since adversarial distillation
does not minimize the pixel-wise distance to intermediate
images or denoising scores that are usually incoherent, our
method can reliably generate photorealistic texture details.
Consistency. Directly training a 3D GAN at high reso-
lutions using above-mentioned way is computationally in-
feasible. Therefore, existing methods [ 7,14,97] rely on
image-space convolutions to upscale the resolution of the
raw renderings. While 2D upsampling can ensure high-
quality and 3D consistent renderings with imperceptible
artifacts for forward-facing data [ 14], we experimentally ob-
serve that naively applying this approach to 360 °object-level
3D synthesis leads to significant multi-view inconsistencies.

score [ 87]. For the Image Score we compute the CLIP distance
between rendered and reference views, while for the Text Score,
we compute the CLIP distance between rendered and text promots.
We color each row as best , second best , and third best .
As shown in Fig. 3, we resolve this issue by baking the
2D upsampler branch into a 3D triplane upsampler via patch-
wise similarity following [ 18]. The motivation here is two-
fold: 1) By sharing the same latent code w, the image ren-
dered through the 3D upsampler has the potential to capture
high-frequency details similar to those produced by the 2D
branch output. 2) Once trained, renderings from the same
triplane trivially preserve 3D consistency. Therefore, given
a latent code zand a camera pose c, we use the LPIPS [ 133]
loss to optimize the 3D upsampler as:
Lconsistency=LPIPS(I3D,sg(I2D)), (9)
where I2DandI3Dare images generated from the 2D and
the 3D upsampling branches respectively and sgdenotes
stopping gradient. For efficiency we only calculate Eq. (9)
in642patch-level. We also train a small patch discriminator
to ensure the renderings of upsampled triplane preserving
high-frequency details, using a similar objective as in Eq. (7).
3.3. Multi-View Sampling
In this section, we discuss our strategy for sampling and fil-
tering high-quality images from p0(⋅)in order to effectively
perform adversarial distillation and calculate Eq. (7).
Sampling. Diffusion models [ 92,93] can produce high-
quality images, but often exhibit a bias towards generating
frontal-facing images, thus failing to adequately span the
entire azimuth ϕ∈[0,2π]and elevation θ∈[0, π]angles.
However, this bias can make the discriminator overfit to
particular viewpoints, resulting in inaccurate gradients when
optimizing the 3D generator. To resolve this we leverage
the view-dependent diffusion model of Zero-1-to-3 [ 64] to
produce more diverse views given a single input image.
Pruning. Although the view-conditioned diffusion model
could assist us towards obtaining free-view diffusion priors
in 360 °, we still observe several issues. For instance, the
generated viewpoints may not adhere to the target camera
pose, or there may be substantial geometric degradation in
the generated images, resulting in visible 3D misalignment
compared to the reference image as shown in the supplemen-
tary. Although the discriminator can tolerate some errors
to a certain extent, the frequent occurrence of misalignment
will significantly undermine the stability of GAN training.To this end, we propose a camera pose pruning strategy
aiming at filtering out “bad diffusion samples”. Specifically,
given a reference image and a target camera pose, we syn-
thesize Nsamples in parallel with reverse denoising. To
capture the essential geometric characteristics of the target
pose, we compute a shared overlapping mask maccording
to the generated samples, which is then dilated to allow a
certain degree of geometry deformation. We consider the pix-
els within the mask as “good”, and compute the maximum
number of “bad pixels” (i.e. pixels outside the mask) among
the generated samples. If this maximum count exceeds a
predefined threshold, we discard this viewpoint.
In addition to the geometric consistency check, we also
assess the semantic and structural similarity between sam-
pledIi
synand reference views Irusing the pre-trained CLIP
image encoder as follows:
min
i=1∶NCLIP image(Ii
syn, Ir). (10)
If the score of (10), for a specific view, is below a threshold,
we reject this viewpoint. Viewpoints that fail to pass any of
these two checks are discarded. Among images from the
same view, we select the sample with the highest CLIP score.
Distribution Refinement. Although the generated images,
produced by the view-dependent Zero-1-to-3 [ 64] are more
diverse in terms of camera poses, they often lack appearance
variations and exhibit blurred textures. To mitigate this, we
propose to further refine the prior extracted by [ 64] with a
powerful text-guided 2D diffusion model [ 1,132]. Specifi-
cally, for the sample generated with [ 64], we add noise over
the image with specific strength and then denoise it by [ 1] to
generate high-quality and diversified refinement, which still
retains similar pose and semantics with the input. In general,
using a higher noise level typically yields more diverse gen-
erations, however this also poses a challenge in maintaining
the original pose information. Therefore, we also try Con-
trolNet [ 132] conditioned on depth maps to achieve better
3D diversity while preserving pose information. We show
more analysis in the supplementary.
4. Experimental Evaluation
Datasets. In our evaluation, we consider images from three
sources: (i) high-quality real-world images from the Inter-
net, (ii) synthetic scenes from Blender including Synthetic-
NeRF [73] and Synthetic-NSVF [62], and (iii) images gen-
erated by a text-to-image diffusion model. For the case of
objects from [ 62,73], we only utilize a single image and
ignore its associated pose information. When no text de-
scriptions are provided, we employ an off-the-shelf image
caption pipeline [56] to obtain a per-image text description.
Baselines. We assess the performance of our approach
against two significant image-to-3D methods including
Magic123 [ 86] and Zero-1-to-3 [ 64], as well as two no-
table text-to-3D techniques, DreamFusion [ 85] and Prolific-

Dreamer [ 117]. We use the improved implementation from
ThreeStudio [ 33] for the baseline training with shared input
view, prompt, pose and resolution across all the methods.
Evaluation Metrics. We follow common practice [ 63,85,
86] and report the CLIP similarity score [ 87] with different
image-based ViT [ 25] and text-based architectures trained
by OpenAI. Specifically, we create a 360 °camera trajectory
orbiting the object with 120 frames that cover different views.
For each view, we calculate the image and text similarity
with a reference image and a text prompt respectively. In
our evaluation, we consider a total of 1,200images gath-
ered from our data sources. Additional details as well as a
user study that evaluates the subjective synthesis quality and
diversity are provided in the supplementary.
Implementation Details. In our framework, we adopt the
3D generator architecture of EG3D [ 14] with a few key mod-
ifications tailored to our specific 3D adversarial distillationformulation. First, we remove the pose conditioning from
the generator, as we are interested in modeling generic ob-
jects. To guide the generator to learn the correct 3D pose
prior, we follow [ 14] and inject the absolute camera pose
into the discriminator. During optimization we generate 10K
samples per object and enable the adaptive discriminator
augmentation (ADA) [ 49] to stabilize the adversarial train-
ing. During the distribution refinement step, we employ
a noise strength of 0.8for the depth-conditioned Control-
Net [ 132] and noise strengths of 0.3and0.7for the low and
high-resolution branches of DeepFloyd [ 1]. Moreover, we
leverage the view-dependent prompting to avoid the multi-
face issue while dealing with asymmetric objects. To obtain
a 3D distribution based on the image and prompt, the train-
ing process takes approximately 3 days for images of 2562
resolution, where training the 2D upsampler branch requires
1.5 days and fine-tuning together with the 3D upsampler

better in terms of diversity, quality and photorealism. Note that in contrast to DreamFusion [ 85] and ProlificDreamer [ 117] that require
re-optimizing for more than 10hours for each novel sample, our model can generate diverse and novel 3D objects within a second.
requires another 1.5 days on 4 ×V100 GPUs. Additional
implementation details are provided in the supplementary.
4.1. Comparisons
We now compare our adversarial distillation framework with
existing score distillation methods and demonstrate that it
performs better in terms of generation quality and diversity.
Quantitative Comparison. In Table 1, we compare all
methods wrt. their consistency in terms of appearance and se-
mantic similarity. In particular, we note that our method sig-
nificantly outperforms all baselines in terms of the CLIP im-
age score. This is expected, as our renderings are more pho-
torealistic and do not suffer from over-saturation and over-
smoothing issues apparent in existing SDS-based pipelines.
In terms of text similarity metrics, our approach again out-
performs all baselines when using the ViT-L/14 pre-trained
model, while performing on-par with [ 86] when using the
ViT-B/32 pre-trained model. The superiority of our model in
both metrics indicates its ability to better match the condi-
tioning signal and generate more high-quality 3D contents.
Qualitative Comparison. In Fig. 4, we qualitatively com-
pare our model with several baselines. Compared to Dream-
fusion [ 85] that generates blurry 3D objects with highly satu-
rated colors, our model produces more photorealistic objects
with fine details. ProlificDreamer [ 117] further proposes
VSD, which replaces a single NeRF fitting into distribution
matching, demonstrating improved texture details. However,
VSD tends to generate multi-face 3D like shown in the sec-ond row of Fig. 4. Even for the symmetric objects like burger,
its 3D rendering exhibits non realistic colors similar to [ 85].
In contrast, both Magic123 [ 86] and Zero-1-to-3 [ 64] par-
tially mitigate the color shift issues, but still generate objects
with blurry appearance. Instead, our adversarial distillation
framework attains a higher level of photorealism, while pre-
serving the multi-view consistent fine details.
Diversity. A key benefit of our approach is that it can gener-
ate diverse 3D objects after distillation. To showcase this, in
this section, we compare our model with DreamFusion [ 85]
and ProlificDreamer [ 117] in terms of their ability to produce
diverse renderings conditioned on the text prompt “ running
shoes ”. For our model, we condition our generation on the
same text prompt and an input image showing a white shoe,
which we provide in the supplement. Note that currently
ProlificDreamer doesn’t share the multi-particle implemen-
tation thus to obtain the diversity we have to use different
seeds for re-optimization. As shown in Fig. 5, even with vari-
ations, both DreamFusion [ 85] and ProlificDreamer [ 117]
produce smooth objects with highly-saturated colors that
exhibit Janus-like issues. By contrast, our method obtains
significantly better quality and diversity. Moreover, since the
the learned 3D generator models the target distribution, our
model could generate diverse and novel 3D objects signifi-
cantly faster than all the baselines without re-optimization.

investigate its impact on the Lego scene from Synthetic-
NeRF [ 73]. We start by removing the camera pose pruning
and observe that the the rendering quality deteriorates signif-
icantly, as shown in the second column of Fig. 6. To prevent
this behavior from being caused by the information leakage
of Adaptive Discriminator Augmentation (ADA) [ 49] , we
further increase the diffusion samples from 10K to 100K
while also removing ADA [ 49]. In this scenario, the pose
and color seem plausible but the generation quality is still
relatively low. In contrast, using camera pose pruning en-
ables the training of a superior 3D GAN, even with limited
amount of data, highlighting its efficacy and critical role in
enhancing the overall performance of adversarial distillation.
Distribution Refinement. Distribution refinement is a key
step to ensure the generation quality and diversity of our dis-
tillation pipeline. As shown in Fig. 7, optimizing the 3D gen-
erator using the original samples from the view-dependent
Zero-1-to-3 [ 64] without enough diversities could learn to
capture a basic shape and appearance but fails to produce
high-quality and diverse generations.
Single Mode v.s. Distribution Modeling. We would like
to further demonstrate the importance of distribution match-
ing to achieve photorealistic and diversified 3D generation.
We now consider the Ficus scene from Synthetic-NeRF [ 73].
This scene is particularly challenging as it contains thin
structures with high-frequency texture details. As shown
in Fig. 8, Magic123 [ 86], which tries to find a single mode
under the guidance of score direction, shows poor geom-
etry and rendering quality. Moreover, we also try to fit a
single NeRF [ 73] directly using the raw sampled images
from Zero-1-to-3 [ 64] without any refinement (see second

Figure 8. Impact of Single Mode Fitting and Distribution Mod-

model could yield realistic and 3D consistent renderings.
column) and the improved samples using proposed distribu-
tion refinement strategy (see third column). As we could see,
both these variants yield low-quality rendering with blurry
artifacts. In contrast, our method CAD could render realistic
and highly detailed frames with multi-view consistency.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed CAD, a new approach for gen-
erating high-quality, photoreaslisitc and diverse 3D objects
conditioned on a single image and a text prompt. Despite
the promising results of our model, it still has several lim-
itations. One of the main bottlenecks of our framework is
the optimization speed, which is hindered by the inherently
slow process of volumetric rendering required to generate
high-resolution frames ( ∼0.1 FPS). A potential solution
to address this limitation is the adoption of more efficient
rendering techniques, such as Gaussian Splatting [ 51]. More-
over, currently we only consider a single conditioning input,
joint training with multiple conditions potentially could re-
sult in more diverse geometry and appearance variations.
Finally, although we mainly focused on the object-level 3D
synthesis, extending CAD to scene-level scenarios is also a
very promising research direction.
