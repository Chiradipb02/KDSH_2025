with the above concerns, this paper firstly formulates Black-box Video Domain Adaptation
(BVDA) as a more realistic yet challenging scenario where the source video model is pro-
vided only as a black-box predictor. While a few methods for Black-box Domain Adaptation

1 Introduction
Video Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (VUDA) (Chen et al., 2019a; Xu et al., 2021a; 2022a) aims to
transfer knowledge from a labeled source video domain to an unlabeled target video domain. It has wide
applications in scenarios where massive labeled video data may not be available. Despite their effectiveness
in improving the robustness of video models (Xu et al., 2022b), current VUDA methods require access to
the source video data which contains personal and private information, raising serious concerns about data
privacy and model portability (Liang et al., 2020a; 2022). The Source-Free Video Domain Adaptation (Xu
et al., 2022c; Tian et al., 2021) is subsequently formulated to learn a target model without access to source
data, yet it still relies on the well-trained source model parameters which allow generative models to recover
source videos (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Creswell & Bharath, 2018; Luan et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021).
Privacy-preserving is vital in applying action recognition models to real-world applications such as in smart
hospitals and security surveillance where action recognition models are leveraged for anomaly behavior
recognition (Sultani et al., 2018; Said et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 2022). In these cases,
current VUDA methods are totally inapplicable when sharing models across organizations due to their
violation of privacy-related regulations, such as the European GDPR (Goddard, 2017) and Singaporean
PDPA (Chik, 2013). To further cope with the video privacy issue, we formulate and study a more realistic
and challenging video domain adaptation scenario termed the Black-box Video Domain Adaptation
(BVDA) where the source video model is provided for adaptation only as a black-box predictor (e.g., API
service). In privacy-concerned scenarios, BVDA helps to derive an accurate model in the target domain
without access to both the parameters and data in the source domain.
Without access to source data and model, existing VUDA methods that aim at enhancing transferability
through statistical alignment (e.g., TAMAN (Xu et al., 2023)) or adversarial alignment (e.g., TA3N (Chen
et al., 2019a) and SAVA (Choi et al., 2020)) are not applicable. There have been a few recent research
efforts (Liang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2022) aiming at Black-box Domain Adaptation for images. One rep-
resentative work is DINE (Liang et al., 2022), where target features are extracted by obtaining pseudo-labels
from the black-box predictors while applying structural regularizations (Viola & Wells III, 1997; Verma
et al., 2019) that encourage better model discriminability and generalization ability. However, structural
regularizations of DINE are tailored for images that only contain spatial features. In comparison, charac-
terized by the multi-modality nature, videos consist of spatial features and additional temporal information.
This result in additional challenges in aligning temporal features. As a result, solutions for images such as
DINE cannot show significant improvements for the BVDA task. Previous studies (Chen et al., 2019b; Yang
et al., 2020a; Kundu et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022) prove that improving discriminability would benefit the
effectiveness of domain adaptation. Inspired by these studies, we propose to improve the discriminability of
temporal features to tackle BVDA effectively when neither source data nor source model is accessible.

One common strategy to extract video temporal features is to split longer videos into a series of shorter
clips. Therefore, temporal features can be constructed explicitly with the series of clip features (Wang et al.,
2018; Zhou et al., 2018). Meanwhile, humans are capable of recognizing actions correctly even with only
representative clips from videos (Isik et al., 2018). Intuitively, if the target model is able to perform
similarly to human perception and obtain discriminative features with consistent predictions
given only partial clip information, the representational capacity of the target model and the
discriminability of the extracted target temporal features could be improved significantly even
without knowledge from the source domain . We term the above hypothesis as the masked-temporal
hypothesis as this hypothesis depicts the ideal characteristics of features obtained after certain clips are
masked out. Our proposed method is built upon this hypothesis.
To this end, we propose the Endo and e Xo-TEmporalRegularized Network (EXTERN ) to address the
BVDA task. EXTERN extracts robust temporal features in a self-supervised manner by applying both
theendo-temporal regularization and the exo-temporal regularization while distilling knowledge from the
predictions obtained from the source predictor. Specifically, the endo-temporal regularization is designed to
improve the discriminability of clip features by regularizing the behavior of clip features obtained within the
same target video . This drives the clip features towards complying with the cluster assumption (Rigollet,
2007; Xiao et al., 2023) and the masked-temporal hypothesis as presented in Fig. 1. The endo-temporal
regularization is achieved by augmenting the target video domain with virtual temporal features through a
novelmask-to-mix strategy over clip features corresponding to the same video.
Meanwhile, the exo-temporal regularization is designed to drive the proposed model to extract more stable
and discriminable temporal features, characterized by being linearly smooth in-between features obtained
fromdifferent target videos . The exo-temporal regularization is achieved by augmenting the target video
domainwithinterpolatedtemporalfeatures. ItisremarkablethatourEXTERNachievesoutstandingresults,
outperforming most existing VUDA methods that require source data and models. This demonstrates that
training the target model from scratch may help overcome the negative effect of domain shift, paving a new
way for tackling VUDA.
In summary, our contributions are threefold. (i) We formulated a realistic and more challenging task, Black-
box Video Domain Adaptation (BVDA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address black-
box domain adaptation for privacy-preserving and portable video model transfer. (ii) We propose EXTERN
to address BVDA, which enhances discriminative temporal feature extraction through an endo-temporal
regularization using a mask-to-mix strategy along with an exo-temporal regularization, driving clip features
towards complying with the masked-temporal hypothesis . (iii) Extensive experiments show the efficacy of
EXTERN, achieving state-of-the-art performances across cross-domain action recognition benchmarks under
closed-set and partial-set video domain adaptation settings. EXTERN achieves remarkable 7.7%and12.4%
average improvements under the closed-set and the partial-set settings respectively, even outperforming most
existing adaptation methods with access to source data.

auxiliary tasks such as contrastive learning (Chen et al., 2020) and clip order prediction (Choi et al., 2020).
Compared to UDA research which is primarily focused on image-based tasks, VUDA research lags behind
owing to the challenges brought by aligning temporal features. Despite the challenges, there has been a
substantial increase in research for VUDA, backed by the introduction of various cross-domain closed-set or
partial-set video datasets (Chen et al., 2019a; Xu et al., 2021a; 2023). Regardless of the improvements in
video model robustness and transferability, VUDA approaches all require access to both source data and
source model parameters during adaptation, which could raise serious privacy concerns given the amount of
private information of the subjects and scenes contained in videos.
Black-box Domain Adaptation (BDA). With the increased importance of data privacy with concerns
of possible data leakage through white-box attack given model parameters (Zhang et al., 2020), there have
been a few research that explores BDA with images. BDA enables image models to be adapted to the
unlabeled target domain without either the source data or the source model parameters, with the source
model provided only as a black-box predictor (Fang et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2023). Under such settings,
BBSE (Lipton et al., 2018) focused on black-box label shift, and requires a hold-out source set for class
confusion matrix estimation, which is commonly unavailable. More recently, LNL (Zhang et al., 2021)
proposed to tackle BDA by an iterative noisy learning approach via pseudo labels that are refined with KL
divergence, while DINE (Liang et al., 2022) leveraged knowledge distillation with information maximization
and structural regularizations. Despite the above recent advances, BVDA has never been explored, which
is more challenging as temporal features must also be aligned. We propose to tackle BVDA by applying a
temporal feature tailored endo-temporal regularization leveraging a mask-to-mix strategy, along with exo-
temporal regularization.
3 Methodology
ForBlack-box Video Domain Adaptation (BVDA), we only have access to a black-box video pre-
dictorHS(i.e., the constraint Source API) which is trained from the labeled source video domain
DS={(ViS,yiS)}nS
i=1containing nSvideos, with ViS∈VS,yiS∈YS, whereVSis the source input dis-
tribution andYSthe source label space. We are also given an unlabeled target video domain DT={ViT}nT
i=1
4Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (02/2024)
withnTi.i.d. videos ViT∈VTwhereVTis the target input distribution. Additionally, we assume that source
and target video domains share the same label space with Cclasses, i.e.,YS=YTwithYTdenoting the
target label space. Meanwhile the source and target videos follow different data distributions. Therefore,
there exists a domain shift (Ben-David et al., 2006) between DSandDT. The objective of BVDA is to learn
a mapping model VT→YTto perform the action recognition task on the unlabeled DTwhile bothDSand
the parameters of HSare not accessible.
Constrained by the absence of both the source data and the parameters of the source model, neither VUDA
methods nor SFVDA methods could be directly applied for BVDA. To tackle BVDA, we resort to an
alternative strategy where we adapt target models to the embedded semantic information of the source
data by resorting to the hard or soft predictions of the target domain from the black-box source predictor
ˆYT=HS(VT). Essentially, for BVDA, such a strategy aims to extract effective temporal features with high
discriminability and comply with the cluster assumption, where the input distribution contains separated
data clusters and that data samples in the same cluster share the same class label (Rigollet, 2007). We
therefore propose EXTERN which drives temporal feature towards high discriminability in a self-supervised
manner relying on both the endo-temporal regularization and the exo-temporal regularization . We first
introduce the backbone structure of the target model, followed by a thorough illustration over EXTERN
and its key components.
3.1 Backbone Network
Videos differ from images greatly due to the existence of temporal features. A key prerequisite for the target
network to be adapted to the embedded source semantic information is that its backbone could extract
temporal features explicitly. An efficient and popular approach constructs the temporal features explicitly
with a series of clip features, obtained through clips sampled from the corresponding videos (Wang et al.,
2018; Zhou et al., 2018). One notable example is the Temporal Relation Network (TRN) (Zhou et al., 2018).
TRN has been widely adopted in previous video domain adaptation tasks, such as VUDA (Chen et al.,
2019a; Xu et al., 2022b), PVDA (Xu et al., 2021a) and SFVDA (Xu et al., 2022c) bringing state-of-the-art
results. This is thanks to its ability in extracting accurate temporal features by reasoning over correlations
between spatial representations which coincides with the process of humans recognizing actions.
Formally, we define an input target video with kframes asVi={f(1)
i,f(2)
i,...,f(k)
i}, withf(j)
ibeing the
spatial feature of the j-th frame in the i-th source video. The subscript for the target domain Tis omitted for
clarity. The spatial features are extracted from the source spatial feature generator Gspwhich is formulated
as a 2D-CNN (e.g., ResNet-50 or ResNet-101 (He et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021)). Subsequently, the temporal
feature ofViis constructed by a combination of multiple clip features, obtained from the temporal feature
generatorGt. More specifically, Gtbuilds each clip feature with rtemporal-ordered sampled frames where
r∈[2,k]. Formally, a clip feature for Vi, denoted as cl(r)
i, is defined by:
cl(r)
i=/summationdisplay
mg(r)((V(r)
i)m). (1)
Here (V(r)
i)m={f(a)
i,f(b)
i,...}mis defined as the m-th clip with rtemporal-ordered frames, where aandb
are the frame indices. aandbmay not be consecutive as the clip could be extracted with nonconsecutive
frames, but should be both constrained within the range of [1,k]withb > a. Eventually, the clip feature
cl(r)
iis obtained by fusing all the rtime ordered frame-level spatial features through an integration function
g(r), which is usually formulated as a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The above computation would result
in a total of (k−1)clips. Finally, the temporal feature of Vi, denoted as ti, is computed through the mean
aggregation applied across all clip features, defined as:
ti=1
k−1/summationdisplay
rcl(r)
i. (2)
3.2 Endo and Exo-Temporal Regularizations
Endo-temporal Regularization Current methods for BDA (Liang et al., 2022) attempt to obtain fea-
tures from the unlabeled target data with high discriminability via self-supervised learning by applying
5Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (02/2024)
structural regularizations. However, such regularizations are only tailored for spatial features since relevant
studies are only conducted over image-based BDA tasks. Comparatively, videos contain temporal features
that are constructed from a series of clip features. As depicted in Fig. 1, clip features of discriminative
temporal features may still be scattered across the decision boundary thus predicted with different label pre-
dictions. This results in indistinct semantic information contained within the temporal features and causes
inferior target domain performance. The key to tackling BVDA is to improve the discriminability of clip
features by regularizing the behavior of clip features from the same target video. This is achieved by our
proposed endo-temporal regularization performed over clip features.
More specifically, clip features that are discriminative should meet both the cluster assumption and the
masked-temporal hypothesis . Notably, the masked-temporal hypothesis matches the human intuition that a
combination of partial clip features from the same video would still result in consistent prediction as the
overall temporal features that combines all clip features if both the temporal features and their clip features
are of high discriminability. In other words, the clip features of high discriminability should be clustered
toward the corresponding temporal feature.
To attain discriminable clip features, we first augment the target domain with virtual temporal features
obtained via a novel yet simple mask-to-mix strategy as depicted in Fig. 2. We first define the virtual
temporal feature of Vias˜ti. It is constructed by mixing a set of clip features cl(r)
i,r∈[2,k]selected by a
random masking process.If the temporal feature tiis built upon a set of (k−1)clips, there will be exactly
(k−3)clips masked randomly, leaving two randomly unmasked clips: cl(r1)
iandcl(r2)
i, wherer1,r2∈[2,k].
For each mini-batch, the selection of masked clips is random across all input videos within the mini-batch
and across each epoch. This is to ensure that the virtual temporal features of Viare built upon all possible
clip pairs from Viacross the whole training process. Different from the temporal feature which is constructed
through a simple mean aggregation where all clip features are combined with equal weights, we compute
the virtual temporal feature via the MixUp (Zhang et al., 2018) operation. The virtual temporal feature is
computed as a linear combination of the two unmasked clips assigned with random weights, defined as:
˜ti= MixUpλv(cl(r1)
i,cl(r2)
i)
=λvcl(r1)
i+ (1−λv)cl(r2)
i,(3)
whereλv∈Beta (αv,αv)is the weight assigned to cl(r1)
isampled from a Beta distribution with αvas the hy-
perparameter. The virtual temporal feature constructed is essentially the linear intermediate representation
between the unmasked clip features.
With the constructed virtual temporal feature, the masked-temporal hypothesis is satisfied by encouraging
the virtual temporal prediction to be consistent with the prediction of the corresponding target video (or
equivalently, the corresponding target temporal feature). To achieve such prediction consistency, we aim
to minimize the divergence between the virtual temporal prediction and the target prediction. The virtual
temporal prediction is obtained from the target predictor HTdirectly, i.e., ˜yi=HT(˜ti). The target pre-
diction is obtained by applying the target predictor to the target temporal feature, i.e., yi=HT(ti). The
minimization of prediction divergence is formulated as:
Lpre=DKL(˜yi∥yi), (4)
whereDKL(·∥·)denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
To further ensure that the temporal feature contains distinctive semantic information, the clip features
should also comply with the cluster assumption, where clip features of the same target video share the same
class label. Previous studies (Zhang et al., 2018) suggest that the discriminability of extracted features
can be improved and thus the cluster assumption is met if the feature generator behaves linearly in-between
trainingsamples. Theclusterassumptionofclipfeaturesisthereforecompliedbyemployingtheinterpolation
consistency training (ICT) technique (Verma et al., 2019). Specifically, such a technique encourages the
virtual temporal prediction ( ˜yi) to be consistent with the mixed unmasked clip prediction. The mixed
unmaskedclippredictioniscomputedasthelinearcombinationofthetargetpredictionsfrombothunmasked
clips. The mixed unmasked clip prediction is computed as the linear combination of the target predictions
6Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (02/2024)
from both unmasked clips, defined as:
ymix,i = MixUpλv(HT(cl(r1)
i),HT(cl(r2)
i))
=λvHT(cl(r1)
i) + (1−λv)HT(cl(r2)
i).(5)
Subsequently, we aim to optimize the loss function:
Lvir=lce(˜yi,ymix,i), (6)
wherelcedenotes the cross-entropy loss.
Overall, the proposed endo-temporal regularization drives the target model to obtain discriminable temporal
features by extracting clip features with higher discriminability that comply with the masked-temporal hy-
pothesisand the cluster assumption. The endo-temporal regularization is applied by jointly optimizing Eq. 4
and Eq. 6:
Lendo=Lvir+Lpre. (7)
The implementation of the endo-temporal regularization can be observed to be very simple, yet it brings
significant improvements towards tackling BVDA, as would be presented in Sec. 4.
Exo-temporal Regularization To further enhance the discriminability of the temporal feature, we ex-
tend the promotion of linear behavior in-between training samples towards the temporal features from
different target videos. The temporal features are thus regularized by our proposed exo-temporal regular-
ization. Given a pair of videos Vi,Vj, we employ the ICT (Verma et al., 2019) across their corresponding
temporal features ti,tj. Such operation is equivalent to augmenting the target video domain with inter-
polated temporal features which would drive the model towards better generalization. Formally, similar to
how virtual temporal features are constructed, the interpolated temporal features of ti,tjare obtained by
applying MixUp (Zhang et al., 2018). With yi=HT(ti)andyj=HT(tj)denoting the target predictions of
tiand tj, the exo-temporal regularization aims to optimize the loss function:
Lexo=lce(HT(MixUpλt(ti,tj)),MixUpλt(yi,yj)), (8)
wherelceis the cross-entropy loss. MixUpλtis defined as shown in Eq. 3 and 5, and λt∈Beta (αt,αt)is the
weight assigned to tiwithαtas the hyperparameter.
Our mask-to-mix strategy utilizes MixUp for the construction of virtual temporal features, which seeks to
obtain consistent prediction as the temporal features such that the corresponding clip features satisfy the
masked-temporal hypothesis , which is different from existing domain adaptation works based on Mixup that
regards it as a data augmentation approach (Xu et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Panfilov et al.,
2019).
3.3 Endo and eXo-TEmporal Regularized Network
With the endo-temporal regularization andexo-temporal regularization terms defined, we propose the EX-
TERN to address BVDA leveraging on both regularizations, as depicted in Fig. 2. EXTERN builds upon
the TRN backbone structure as specified in Sec. 3.1.
Extracting Knowledge via Knowledge Distillation. To extract knowledge from the black-box predic-
torHS, knowledge distillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015) has proven to be an effective solution. The target
model is seen as the student, and is trained to learn predictions analogous to that produced by the source
model, which is seen as the teacher. However, due to domain shift between the source domain DSand target
domainDT, the output from the source model could be noisy and inaccurate. To cope with such drawback,
theadaptive label smoothing (AdaLS) technique (Liang et al., 2022) with self-distillation (Laine & Aila,
2017) and exponential moving average (EMA) (Grebenkov & Serror, 2014) update is recently proposed.
Here, only the predictions of the top- cclasses are directly utilized while predictions of other classes are
7Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (02/2024)
forced to a uniform distribution as:
ˆy′
i= AdaLS c(ˆyi) =

ˆyp

where ˆyi∈ˆYis the prediction of the target video Viobtained from the black-box source predictor HS(i.e.,
the teacher prediction), while yp
idenotes the prediction of the p-th class andTc
idenotes the class index set
of the top-cpredictions for input Vi. The teacher prediction is further dynamically updated per training
epoch to maintain a EMA prediction. We apply AdaLS with EMA to reduce noisy information by focusing
only on the top-predicted classes. Extracting source knowledge is eventually achieved by optimizing:
Lkd=EVi∈DTDKL(ˆy′
i∥yi). (10)
Learning Adaptive Clip Weights. Previous research (Nguyen et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2019a) shows
that features with lower prediction uncertainty would possess higher discriminability. Therefore, to better
aggregate the clip features for the temporal feature, we assign a clip weight to each clip feature by attending
toclipfeatureswithlowerpredictionuncertainty. Specifically, theclipweightisdefinedastheadditiveinverse
of the target predictions of the corresponding clip, computed as:
wcl(r)
i= 1−h(HT(cl(r)
i)), (11)
where the constant 1 is added as a residual connection for more stable optimization. Subsequently, the
temporal feature is obtained as the weighted aggregation of all clip features, with Eq. 2 modified as:
ti=1

Information Maximization. Inspired by prior works in BDA (Liang et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2022), we
maximize the mutual information (MI) to encourage diversity among target predictions and to promote
their individual certainty:
Lmi=h(EVi∈DTyi)−EVi∈DTh(yi), (13)
whereyi=HT(Gsp(Gt(Vi))) =HT(ti)is the target prediction for input Viandh(yi) =−/summationtextC

the conditional entropy function. Maximizing MI could marginally improve the performances for BVDA,
as would be shown later in the ablation studies (Sec. 4.3).
The aforementioned techniques of leveraging AdaLS, adaptive clip weights and information maximization
have been proven to be effective for black-box domain adaptation for images (Liang et al., 2022) and source-
free video unsupervised domain adaptation (Xu et al., 2022c). They are leveraged to build a strong baseline
for BVDA.

4 Experiments
In this section, we evaluate our proposed EXTERN across a variety of cross-domain action recognition
benchmarks, covering a wide range of cross-domain scenarios. We demonstrate exceptional performances
on all benchmarks. Moreover, thorough ablation studies and analysis of EXTERN are performed to further
justify the design of EXTERN.
4.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets. We evaluate EXTERN on three benchmarks: UCF-HMDB full(Chen et al., 2019a), Sports-
DA (Xu et al., 2023) and Daily-DA (Xu et al., 2023). UCF-HMDB fullis one of the most common bench-
marksforVUDAandisconstructedfromUCF101(U101)(Soomroetal.,2012)andHMDB51(H51)(Kuehne
et al., 2011), each corresponding to a separate domain. Sports-DA is a large-scale benchmark with three
domains, built from UCF101, Sports-1M (S1M) (Karpathy et al., 2014), and Kinetics (K600). Daily-DA
incorporates both normal and low-illumination videos with four domains, built from ARID (A11) (Xu et al.,
2021b) (a low-illumination video dataset), HMDB51, Moments-in-Time (MIT) (Monfort et al., 2019), and
Kinetics (Kay et al., 2017). The distant domain shift due to immense illumination difference renders it more
challenging.
Implementation. We implement our method with the PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) library. To obtain
video features, we instantiate Temporal Relation Network (TRN) (Zhou et al., 2018) with ResNet-50 (He
et al., 2016) as the model backbone for both the black-box source model and the target model. The TRN
is leveraged thanks to its capability in extracting explicit temporal features via reasoning over correlations
between spatial representations which coincides with how humans recognize actions. The TRN has therefore
been widely adopted in previous video unsupervised domain adaptation tasks, including closed-set video
domain adaptation (Chen et al., 2019a; Xu et al., 2022b), multi-set video domain adaptation (Xu et al.,
2023), and partial-set video domain adaptation (Xu et al., 2021a), delivering state-of-the-art results in the
respective tasks. For the source model, an additional fully connected layer is inserted before the last fully
connected layer which acts as the classifier. For the target model, following DINE (Liang et al., 2022), a
Batch Normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) and an additional fully connected layer are inserted before the
final classifier, which is constructed with a weight normalization (Salimans & Kingma, 2016) layer and a
fully connected layer.
Similar strategies are applied for training the black-box source model and the target model, where the
TRN backbones are both initialized from pre-trained weights obtained by pre-training on ImageNet (Deng
et al., 2009). All new layers are trained from scratch, with their learning rates set to be 10 times that of
the pretrained-loaded layers. For the black-box source model, the training lasts for 100 epochs for tasks
related to the Sports-DA and the MiniKinetics-UCF dataset, and for 50 epochs for all other datasets. For
the target model, the training lasts for 20 epochs for tasks related to the UCF-HMDB fulldataset and the
UCF-HMDB partialdataset, 30 epochs for tasks related to the Daily-DA dataset and the HMDB-ARID partial
dataset, and50epochsfortheSports-DAdatasetandtheMiniKinetics-UCFdataset. Thestochasticgradient
descent (SGD) algorithm (Bottou, 2010) is used for optimization, with the weight decay set to 0.0001 and
the momentum set to 0.9. The batch size is set to 32 input videos per GPU. Hyper-parameters αv= 0.3
andβreg= 1.0are empirically set and fixed.

Baselines. WecompareEXTERNwithstate-of-the-artBDAapproachesaswellascompetitiveUDA/VDA
approaches. For fair comparisons, all compared methods are re-implemented with the exact same backbone
as EXTERN. Specifically, for BDA approaches, LNL(Zhang et al., 2021) is a noisy label learning method
where pseudo labels are refined with KL divergence and leveraged for iterative network training. HD-SHOT
andSD-SHOT obtain the model through self-training and apply SHOT (Liang et al., 2021) by employing
a cross-entropy loss and weighted cross-entropy loss respectively. We also compare with methods including:
DINE (Liang et al., 2022), DANN (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015), MK-MMD (Long et al., 2015), TA3N (Chen
et al., 2019a), SAVA (Choi et al., 2020), ACAN (Xu et al., 2022b), SHOT (Liang et al., 2021), ATCoN (Xu
et al., 2022c), BA3US (Liang et al., 2020b), PADA (Cao et al., 2018) and PATAN (Xu et al., 2021a). We
report the average accuracies over five runs with identical settings.

4.2 Overall Results and Comparisons
Closed-set Domain Adaptation. We show the results on UCF-HMDB fulland Sports-DA in Tab. 1, and
results on Daily-DA in Tab. 2. Our proposed EXTERN achieve state-of-the-art results across all the three
cross-domain benchmarks. On average, EXTERN outperforms all BDA approaches designed for image-based
DA tasks (i.e., LNL, HD/SD-SHOT and DINE), outperforming the best method by a relative 7.0%,6.0%
and10.2%respectively. This justifies the effectiveness of the designed regularizations tailored for temporal
features whose discriminability relies on clip features complying with the masked-temporal hypothesis and the
cluster assumption. It could also be observed that the prior BDA approaches may fail to tackle BVDA well,
with at least one task of Sports-DA and Daily-DA benchmarks showing inferior performance to that of the
source-only model. Prior BDA approaches focused solely on spatial features, and may not obtain clip features
that meet the masked-temporal hypothesis and temporal feature with distinct semantic information. This
resultinnegativeimpactscomparedtothesource-onlybaseline. Notably, EXTERNevenoutperformsvarious
VUDA approaches (Chen et al., 2019a; Choi et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2022b) with source data accessibility.
Since EXTERN performs adaptation based solely on prediction results, it is found that EXTERN would not
be affected by noise contained within the source data or the source model, generating superior adaptation
results. This shows that training a target model from scratch with strong regularizations while adapting
solely with source predictions can be as effective as data-based domain alignment techniques.
Partial-set Domain Adaptation. Apart from closed-set video domain adaptation, we further demon-
strate the generalization ability of our proposed EXTERN by evaluating on partial-set video domain adap-
tation (PVDA) tasks. To achieve this, we follow (Xu et al., 2021a) and leverage on three other benchmarks:
UCF-HMDB partial, HMDB-ARID partialand MiniKinetics-UCF. Specifically, UCF-HMDB partialis built
from UCF101 and HMDB51 from 14 overlapping categories and contains two PVDA tasks: U-14→H-7and
H-14→U-7.HMDB-ARID partialis built from HMDB51 and ARID, which is more challenging thanks
to the distant domain shift. The dataset is collected from 10 and contains two PVDA tasks: H-10→A-5
andA-10→H-5.MiniKinetics-UCF is a large-scale dataset built from MiniKinetics (Xie et al., 2017)
and UCF101 containing 45 overlapping categories, also containing two PVDA tasks: M-45→U-18and
U-45→M-18.

Different colors denotes different classes.
The results for partial-set cross-domain action recognition are presented in Tab. 3. Partial-set is more
challenging due to the asymmetric label spaces with the existence of “source-only” classes, causing negative
transfer (Cao et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2021a). Negative transfer affects all previous BDA approaches, where
all approaches will under-perform against the source-only baseline in at least one benchmark. Despite
such challenge, EXTERN still achieves outstanding results, outperforming the best BDA approach by a
relative 8.0%,23.1%and6.2%on the three benchmarks respectively. EXTERN also surpasses several PDA
approaches even though EXTERN is not specifically catered for label shift.
4.3 Ablation Studies and Analysis
To gain a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of EXTERN while justifying its design, we perform
detailed ablation studies as shown in Tab. 4 and Fig. 3. Specifically, the ablations studies explore EXTERN
from two perspectives: the effects of individual learning objectives and the effects of assigning clip weights.

The ablation studies are conducted on UCF-HMDB fulland UCF-HMDB partialwith the same TRN backbone
as previous experiments.
Endo and Exo-Temporal Regularizations. As demonstrated in Tab. 4, there is a notable performance
drop when either Lexo,Lendoor any of the components of Lendo(i.e.,LvirandLpre) is removed from the
learning objective, thus justifying that the designed learning objectives complement each other. Further,
by applying the proposed endo and exo-temporal regularizations alone (optimizing Lendo,Lvir, andLpre),
EXTERN could outperform all prior BDA approaches and even some UDA/PDA approaches. This further
proves the effectiveness of both the endo-temporal regularization andexo-temporal regularization since these
regularizations are tailored to temporal features.
Meanwhile, the weights of both the endo- and exo-temporal regularizations are first set equally as βreg.
A larger performance drop occurs when the endo-temporal regularization is not applied. Therefore, it is
intuitive that the two regularization terms may have distinct contributions to the final performance. A
detailed comparison over the contribution of the different regularizations is presented in Tab. 5, where the
weights of the exo- and endo-temporal regularizations are denoted as βex
regandβen
regrespectively. The results
suggests that the endo-temporal regularization would contribute more towards EXTERN’s performance.
This is thanks to its capability in pushing clip features towards the masked-temporal hypothesis . When
βex
reg= 1.0andβen
reg⩽1.0, a small weight increase in the endo-temporal regularization would result in
notable performance improvement of EXTERN. EXTERN achieves the overall best performance when both
regularizations are balanced, further increasing βen
regwould achieve better results in certain adaptation tasks.
Knowledge Distillation, Information Maximization, and Clip Weight. Tab. 4 also shows that ap-
plying knowledge distillation and information maximization brings further improvements towards EXTERN.
However, the scale of which brought by these techniques is marginal compared to applying the temporal
feature-tailored regularizations. Meanwhile, results also justify the need to construct temporal features at-
tentively with clip weight, bringing consistent performance gain, though the gain is also relatively marginal.
Hyperparameter Sensitivity. We focus on studying the hyperparameter sensitivity of βregwhich con-

˜ti. Hereβregis in the range of 0.2 to 1.2 and αvis in the range of 0.1 to 0.9. As shown in Fig. 3, the results
of EXTERN falls within a marginal 0.83%which ranges from 88.06%to88.89%for the U101→H51 task,
and a marginal 0.62%which ranges from 91.33%to91.95%for the H51→U101 task. EXTERN obtains the
best results for both tasks at αv= 0.3andβreg= 1.0. The minimal variations show that the performance of
EXTERN is robust to both hyperparameters. Meanwhile, despite the slight variations, EXTERN maintains
the best results with all the hyperparameter settings.
Feature Visualization. We further understand the characteristics of EXTERN by plotting the t-SNE
embeddings (Van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008) of both the clip features and temporal features extracted by
the source-only model, DINE and EXTERN for H51 →U101, as shown in Fig. 4. It is clearly observed that
both the clip features and temporal features from EXTERN are more clustered and discriminable, justifying

drives clip features towards satisfying the clus-
ter assumption (Rigollet, 2007) and the masked-
temporal hypothesis by augmenting the tar-

tures through a mask-to-mix strategy over clip
features.
that the applied regularizations can promote higher discriminability and better compliance with the cluster
assumption. We can also observe that the distribution of clip features is more similar to the distribution
of temporal features with EXTERN. This intuitively proves that EXTERN drives clip features towards
satisfying the masked-temporal hypothesis where clip features are aligned towards the temporal features, and
ensures that the temporal features contain distinct semantic information with high discriminability.
4.4 Detail Comparison with Related VUDA and UDA Methods
To highlight the novelty of EXTERN, we further compare our EXTERN with previous VUDA and UDA
methods in detail. Specifically, we compare with DINE (Liang et al., 2022), ATCoN (Xu et al., 2022c),
TA3N (Chen et al., 2019a), and DM-ADA (Xu et al., 2020) which is an image-based UDA method that
leverages MixUp (Zhang et al., 2018). The methods are compared from two perspectives: the tasks they
tackle and the techniques leveraged, as shown in Table 6.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this work, we pioneer in formulating and exploring the realistic yet more challenging task of Black-box
Video Domain Adaptation (BVDA) for privacy-preserving and portable video model transfer. We propose
EXTERN for BVDA which obtains effective and discriminative temporal features by driving clip features
to satisfy the masked-temporal hypothesis and the cluster assumption. This is achieved by applying a novel
endo-temporal regularization following a mask-to-mix strategy, along with an exo-temporal regularization.
Results across multiple cross-domain action recognition benchmarks under both closed-set and partial-set
domain adaptation settings justify the efficacy of EXTERN. We believe that such a superior performance of
EXTERN could pave a new way for tackling video domain adaptation without compromising data privacy.
While the proposed EXTERN has proven to be effective for the BVDA task, there is still room for future
improvements. We observe that EXTERN may not perform well in tasks where the domain gap is relatively
large, as depicted in Table 2 for tasks involving the ARID domain. This suggest that the current endo- and
exo-temporal regularizations which are built on features constructed with the linear MixUp approach may
not work under large domain shift scenarios. Virtual temporal features and interpolated temporal features
constructed via higher order computation could be explored. Further, the temporal relationship between
clip features could also be leveraged more explicitly as an additional modality for adaptation. Additionally,
current BVDA tasks have only been explored for the closed-set and partial-set scenarios. More challenging
settings such as the open-set setting where the target video domain may contain target-private classes may
also be further explored.
