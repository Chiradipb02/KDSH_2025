Abstract
We study the differences arising from merging predictors in the causal and anti-
causal directions using the same data. In particular we study the asymmetries that
arise in a simple model where we merge the predictors using one binary variable
as target and two continuous variables as predictors. We use Causal Maximum
Entropy (CMAXENT) as inductive bias to merge the predictors, however, we
expect similar differences to hold also when we use other merging methods that
take into account asymmetries between cause and effect. We show that if we
observe all bivariate distributions, the CMAXENT solution reduces to a logistic
regression in the causal direction and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in the
anticausal direction. Furthermore, we study how the decision boundaries of these
two solutions differ whenever we observe only some of the bivariate distributions
implications for Out-Of-Variable (OOV) generalisation.
1 Introduction
A common problem in machine learning and statistics consists of estimating or combining models
or (expert opinions) of a target variable of interest into a single, hopefully better, model [ 14]. There
are several reasons of why this problem is important. For example, experts might have access to
different data when creating their models, but might not have access to the data available to other
experts, while there might be a modeller who can access the expert’s opinions and put them together
into a single model. Furthermore, experts might specialise in certain areas of the support of the input
space, so that a modeller with access to the expert’s opinions could potentially produce a single model
exploiting the strengths of each modeller. This problem is commonly known as “mixture of experts”,
“expert aggregation”, “merging of experts” or “expert pooling” [40, 22, 6, 31, 30].
The merging of experts problem is usually ill-defined, in the sense that there are multiple joint
models (that is, models that include allcovariates) that after marginalisation would render the same
prediction as the individual experts (that is, those which include only some of the covariates). This
ill-definedness of the problem requires strong inductive biases. One way to provide this inductive bias
in a principled way is through the Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) principle [ 20]. In brief, MAXENT
suggests finding the distribution with maximum Shannon entropy subject to moment constraints. This
turns out to be the same as choosing the distribution closest to the uniform distribution having the
same moments as those given by the constraints. In Section 2.2 we introduce MAXENT and Causal
MAXENT (CMAXENT) in more detail, the latter being an extension that allows to include causal
information when available [17].
38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).Most of the research on the merging of predictors focuses on finding a meta-predictor that uses the
given models and best fits to the data [ 41], whereas the focus of the present article is understanding the
implications of causal assumptions in the merging of experts instead of aiming for models with best
performance. Furthermore, most of this research focuses on predictors that use the same predicting
variables for each of the models. To the best of our knowledge, the only exception is the random
subspace method, notable for being the basis of random forests [15].
What if in addition to the different models, a researcher has some causal knowledge of the underlying
system? For example, they could know whether a variable or set of variables used in a particular
model are causes or effects of the target variable, potentially changing the resulting predictor of
interest. Causal knowledge produces asymmetries that have been exploited in the past to understand
some common machine learning tasks like transfer learning, semi-supervised learning or distribution
shift [35, 39, 18, 21].
In the present work, we investigate how including causal knowledge produces asymmetric results
when merging predictors. In particular, we are interested in how solutions to the CMAXENT principle
[17] differ when we assume different causal relations for the same data. That is, we are interested in
the asymmetries produced by causal assumptions on CMAXENT inferences. In particular, we will
study the differences in the solutions when we assume the causal data generation process (so that
the covariates or predictors are causal parents of our target variable) in contrast with the anticausal
generation process (so that the predictors are causal children of our target variable). We are going
to study these asymmetries in the case where we do not observe all the variables jointly; one of the
differentiating characteristics of this research with respect to other merging of predictors work.
Including the right causal assumptions when merging predictors is relevant, for instance, in the
medical domain. Suppose we are interested in the presence or absence of a disease, and we have
models from hospitals and labs relating risk factors and symptoms to the disease we are interested
in. Combining the predictors would be valuable to predict the disease but it also requires to include
the right causal assumptions, if the direction matters for the merging of predictors: risk factors
cause diseases and diseases cause symptoms. The literature of merging of predictors has focused on
important aspects of the resulting models like generalisation bounds or speed of estimation but the
relation to causality has remained largely unexplored.
Previous approaches have considered the problem of merging of experts using MAXENT [ 25,27,34].
However, such research considers the problem from a purely statistical perspective and does not
study the ramifications of different causal assumptions. In fact, the way they study the aggregation
problem is by merging the probability of the outcome given by each expert without regarding how
these probabilities were produced.
The main contributions of this article can be summarised as follows
•We study the differences in causal and anticausal merging of predictors whenever the
inductive bias used to merge the predictors allows causal information to be included.
•In particular, we find that CMAXENT with a binary target and continuous covariates,
reduces to logistic regression and LDA, two classic classification algorithms, when merging
predictors in causal and anticausal directions, respectively.
•Furthermore, we study the implications of these asymmetries Out Of Variable (OOV)
generalisation whenever we do not observe all the first and second moments as constraints
in the CMAXENT problem.
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we introduce basic notation and
give a brief overview of MAXENT and CMAXENT. Then, in Section 3 we present the optimisation
problem in the causal and anticausal direction and give the explicit solutions of the problems, thereby
connecting the solutions of CMAXENT to well-known classification algorithms. In addition, we
prove that the decision boundary in the causal and anticausal directions, with full knowledge of the
moments (as defined in the section itself) renders equal slopes of the predictors. In Section 4 we
weaken the assumption of full knowledge of the moments and instead assume knowledge of a subset
of the moments in Section 3. Partial knowledge of the moments have implications for Out Of Variable
(OOV) generalisation and resulting in differences in decision boundaries. We close with Section 5
with some discussion and concluding remarks. All the proofs are left to the appendix for the sake of
brevity and clarity of the main text.
22 Notation and preliminaries
2.1 Notation
LetYbe a binary random variable taking values in Y={−1,1}, andX={X1, X2}be a pair
of continuous variables, so that xi∈R. Let f:Y ×R2→Rbe a measurable function and Pa
measure on Y ×R2. We denote EP[f(Y,X)]the expectation of fwith respect to P. We restrict
ourselves to the scenario with two continuous variables and one binary outcome given that we can
already observe asymmetries in the merging of experts, and can visualise such asymmetries without
having to project such space into 2 dimensions. The results here can be easily generalised into a
discrete outcome variable (and indeed we do, in Corollary 7) Throughout the article we will care
about finding a predictor of Yusing Xas covariates. That is, we are interested in the conditional
distribution P(Y|X).
2.2 Maximum Entropy and Causal Maximum Entropy
The Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) principle was born in the statistical mechanics literature as
a way to find a distribution consistent with a set of expectation constraints [ 20]. That is, given
observed sample averages ˜f=1
NPN
i=1f(yi, xi)we want to find a distribution P(Y,X)so that the
expectations with respect to P(Y,X)are equal to those observed.
Notice that MAXENT does not attempt to find the ‘true’ distribution of the data, but instead the
distribution closest to the uniform distribution so that the expectation constraints are satisfied. We will
see examples of such optimisation problems in subsequent sections. Using the Lagrange multiplier
formalism for constrained optimisation, one can prove that the solution to the MAXENT problem
belongs to the exponential family. The MAXENT distribution and its properties have been studied
widely, see Grünwald and Dawid [10] and Wainwright et al. [38] and references therein.
InCausal MAXENT (CMAXENT, Janzing [17]), the optimisation is performed in an assumed causal
order; that is, we first find the MAXENT distribution of causes and then the Maximum Conditional
Entropy of the effects given the inferred distribution of the causes. As argued in [ 36] this typically
results in distributions that are more plausible for the respective causal direction. One can think of
CMAXENT as usual MAXENT with the distribution of the cause as additional constraint, where the
latter has been obtained via separate entropy maximization.
3 Known predictor covariances
We will begin by studying the solution of the CMAXENT problem when we observe all the bivariate
distributions and summarise them with first and second moments. The restriction to first and second
moments has several reasons: First, these simple constraints are already sufficient to explain the
interesting asymmetries between causal and anticausal. Second, including higher order moments
makes the problem computationally harder and increases the risk of overfitting on noisy finite sample
results. Last, including more moments decreases the asymmetries between the causal directions.
Mathematically, we have the following (estimated) expectations and their respective sample averages:

where we assumed the mean of Xis zero.
3.1 The causal direction
Consider the causal graph in Figure 1a and the expectations given in Equations (1) and (2). As
mentioned on Section 2.2, CMAXENT suggests finding the distribution P(X)that maximises
the entropy consistent with the first and second moments of X, and then finding the conditional
distribution P(Y|X)that maximises the conditional entropy consistent with the estimated P(X)
and the moments that involve Y.

These steps can be summarised in the following optimisation problems. First, for P(X),
max
P(x)H(X) =−Z
R2P(x) logP(x) dx
s.t. E[Xi] = ¯xi,withi∈ {1,2}
E[X2
i] = ¯s2
i,withi∈ {1,2}
E[X1X2] = ¯s1,2Z
R2P(x) dx= 1.(3)
On the other hand, the Maximum Conditional Entropy optimisation problem is as follows
max
P(y|x)H(Y|X) =−Z
R2X
yP(y|x)P(x) logP(y|x) dx
s.t.E[Y Xi] =ϕi,withi∈ {1,2}
E[Y] =p
X
yP(y|x) = 1 ,for each x.(4)
Where P(X)is the one we found by solving Equation (3).
Proposition 1 (Resulting distribution in the causal direction) .Using the Lagrange multiplier formal-
ism for the optimisation problems in Equations (3)and(4)we obtain: (i) a multivariate Gaussian
distribution for P(X), and (ii) the distribution of Yconditioned on Xgiven by
Pλ(y|x1, x2) = exp ( λ0y+λ1yx1+λ2yx2+α(x1, x2)) (5)
α(x1, x2) = logX
yexp (λ0y+λ1yx1+λ2yx2), (6)
where α(x)is a normalising constant.
The conditional distribution can be written as
Pλ(Y= 1|x1, x2) =1
2(1 + tanh( λ0+λ1x1+λ2x2)). (7)
The proof of this result can be found in [19, Section 3.1 and 3.2].
Remark 2 Notice that Equation (7), our predictor of interest, is just a rescaled version of a sigmoid
function. That is, we can estimate P(Y|X)with a logistic regression. A similar observation was
done in [ 8] in the context of using an exponential loss for boosting. This relation was further explored
in [24], where a more direct relation to maximum likelihood and exponential families was established.
In Section 5 we discuss how these results in the statistical literature can be interpreted as making
causal assumptions about the relation between the predictor and target variables.
3.2 The anticausal direction
Now consider the graph in Figure 1b. In this scenario, covariates of our predictor of interest are
the effects of our target variable. Following the CMAXENT principle, we first find the distribution
4P(Y)that maximises entropy and is consistent with first moment of Yand then find the distribution
P(X|Y)that maximises conditional entropy consistent with the moments that involve X. After this
two-step process, we are left with the joint distribution P(Y,X)from which we can derive a predictor
ofY,P(Y|X)using Bayes’ Theorem (Section 3.3). The whole procedure can be summarised with
the following optimisation problems. For the cause, we have
max
P(y)H(Y) =−X
yP(y) logP(y)
s.t.E[Y] =p
X
yP(y) = 1 .(8)
And for the effects,
max
P(x|y)H(X|Y) =−Z
R2X
yP(x|y)P(y) logP(x|y)dx
s.t.E[Y Xi] =ϕi,withi∈ {1,2}
E[Xi] = ¯xi,withi∈ {1,2}
E[X2
i] = ¯s2
i,withi∈ {1,2}
E[X1X2] = ¯s1,2Z
R2P(x|y)dx= 1,for each y.(9)
Proposition 3 (Resulting distribution in the anticausal direction) .Using the Lagrange multiplier
formalism for the optimisation problems in Equations (8)and(9), we obtain a Bernoulli distribution
forYwithP(Y= 1) = p, and Pλ(x|y)given by
Pλ(x|y) = exp[ λ1yx1+λ2yx2+λ3x1+λ4x2
+λ5x2
1+λ6x2

(11)
β(y) = logZ
R2exp"X
kλkhk(x, y)#
dx, (12)
where hkare the different functions for which we have the sample averages. The distribution
Pλ(X|Y)is a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions. Both components Pλ(X|Y=−1)
andPλ(X|Y= 1) have the same covariance matrix.
For the following sections, we introduce the following notation for the expectations of the mixture of
Gaussians.
E[X|y] =µy=
µy,1
µy,2
, E[XX⊤|Y] =ΣX|Y (13)
In addition, we will include the subscripts “causal” and “anticausal” where it might be ambiguous
(e.g.,ΣX|Y,causal represents the conditional covariance in the causal scenario and ΣX|Y,anticausal in
the anticausal scenario). As mentioned in Propostion 3, the conditional covariance ΣX|Yis the
same for both values of y. However, we keep the conditional notation to distinguish it from the
marginal covariance of X,ΣXintroduced in Equation (2). In Appendix A we derive the conditional
expectations in Equation (13) and the marginal expectations used as constraints.
Remark 4 Even though the causal graph in the anticausal direction implies that the conditional
covariance ΣXYis diagonal, the CMAXENT solution does not result in a diagonal conditional
covariance. This is true because of the constraints in Equations (1) and (2) and the law of total
covariance. Note that the CMAXENT distribution is not necessarily Markov relative to the given
DAG. As shown in [ 17, Section 5], CMAXENT only provides the best guess and may therefore mix
over different Markovian distributions such that the result is no longer Markovian.
5This relation between the marginal and conditional expectations will be essential in the subsequent
sections where we explore the difference in the decision boundaries of the two resulting predictors of
Y.
3.3 The predictor of Yin the anticausal direction
Recall that our main goal is to produce a predictor of Yas a function of the covariates X. In
Section 3.1 we obtain the predictor of Ydirectly as a result of the CMAXENT principle, given that
the predictor is already in the direction of the causal mechanism. On the other hand, in Section 3.2,
we have to derive the predictor of Yusing the found conditional distributions and Bayes’ rule. The
main result of this section is that with the constraints we have used, CMAXENT in the anticausal
direction is equivalent to Linear Discriminant Analysis [ 14, Section 4.3]. Furthermore, we generalise
this result to Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, and to an exponential family version of discriminant
analysis.
Theorem 5 (Predictor of Yusing Bayes’ rule) .Using the results from Propostion 3, the distribution
Pλ(Y=y|X)is the ratio of the product of the Gaussian component with Pλ(Y=y)and the
mixture of Gaussians resulting from Propostion 3. Minimising the expected 0-1 loss, the optimal
decision rule arising from this distribution is equivalent to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
Corollary 6 (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)) .Quadratic Discriminant Analysis can be
interpreted as CMAXENT in the anticausal direction. This is achieved by replacing
E[X2
i] = ¯s2
iwithi∈ {1,2}, andE[X1X2] = ¯s1,2. (14)
in Equation (9)with the following constraints:
E[X2
i|y] = ¯s2
i,ywithi∈ {1,2}, andE[X1X2|y] = ¯s1,2,y. (15)
We will now extend this idea, where instead of modelling P(X)as a mixture of Multivariate Gaussians
(with equal covariance in LDA or unequal covariance in QDA), P(X)now becomes a mixture of
distributions, each coming from an exponential family of distributions corresponding to a more
general set of constraints.
Corollary 7 (Exponential family discriminant analysis) .Letfibe an arbitrary measurable function
and˜fits corresponding sample average. In the general case where Yis a discrete variable and we
havedcovariates Xin the anticausal direction, the CMAXENT problem with constraints of the form:
E[fi(X)|y] =˜fi,y, (16)
where ˜fi,yare the sample averages of fifor a specific yas in Section 2.2, results in Pλ(X|Y)being
a mixture of exponential family distributions which then can be inverted (using Bayes’ rule) to a
predictor of Y.
Remark 8 In the previous corollary, the functions fican be constant on any of the variables in X.
This idea has been extended to use kernels as a way to map Xinto more complex feature spaces. The
resulting algorithm is called Kernel Fisher discriminant analysis [26, 32, 9].
3.4 The geometry of the decision boundaries
Hastie et al. [14, Chapter 4.4.5 ]conclude that the log-posterior odds of the logistic regression and
LDA are both linear in x, but with different parameters defining the linear relation. In this section, we
revisit these results in more detail and explore whether the CMAXENT solution in causal direction
differs from the solution in anticausal direction. From a statistical decision theory perspective,
the log-posterior odds correspond to the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule, the optimal decision
boundary of a classifier when minimising the expected 0-1 loss [3, Ch. 4.3.3].
Proposition 9 (Normal vector to the decision boundaries in causal and anticausal direction) .Under
the 0-1 loss, the normal vector to the decision boundary of the CMAXENT predictor is proportional
to
1.Σ−1
X,causalϕin the causal direction.
2.Σ−1
X|Y,anticausalϕin the anticausal direction.
6We will now prove that in the case where we know all the expectations in Equations (1) and (2), the
slope of the decision boundaries in causal and anticausal direction are the same.
Theorem 10 (Slope of the decision boundary is the same in causal and anticausal direction) .Using
the constraints in Equations (1)and(2), the slope of Pλ(Y|X)inferred using CMAXENT is the
same in causal and anticausal direction.
Although it might seem from the above result that there is no asymmetry between the logistic
regression and LDA even when we include causal information, this is not entirely true. To begin with,
the decision boundaries may be unequal although they are parallel, but more importantly learning
the parameters of certain model might be easier. In the next section we explore the differences that
persist even under the light of Theorem 10.
3.5 What are the differences?
In the previous sections we found that the slopes of the decision boundary of CMAXENT in both the
causal and anticausal direction are linear and agree, whenever we have the first and second moments
as in Equations (1) and (2). This implies that, if the test data will come from the same distribution
as the training data, either algorithm will work equally well. Previous research has studied the
advantages and disadvantages [ 14,33, Chapter 4.4.5] of each method and their properties such as
asymptotic relative efficiency [ 7], parameter bias [ 13], asymptotic error under label noise [ 4] and
online learning performance [ 1]. All of these analyses base their results on the fact that the logistic
regression does not make an assumption on how the covariates Xare distributed, whereas LDA does.
An alternative way of viewing this distinction is through the lens of generative and discriminative
models. LDA is a generative model since it models both covariates and target variable and logistic
regression only models the target as a function of the input. Ng and Jordan [28] analyse the difference
in efficiency between the Naive Bayes algorithm (a generative model similar to LDA) and logistic
regression, and find that both models have regimes in which they perform better than the other. Using
the same models, Blöbaum et al. [5]and data from [ 35], find empirically that generative models
perform better in anticausal than in causal direction.
4 Partially known covariances
In this section we explore variations of the solution of the CMAXENT solution in causal and
anticausal direction when some of the sample averages are not known. In Section 4.1 we explore
the case where the covariance between a particular predictor and the target is not known, and in
Section 4.2 the case where we do not know the covariance between the predictors. In both cases
we will see that the models we can infer (that is, P(Y|X)) with CMAXENT will depend on the
underlying causal assumptions.
4.1 Unknown predictor-target covariance
Without loss of generality, suppose we do not have the sample covariance between X2andY, that is,
we do not know ϕ2in Equation (1).
In the causal direction , the CMAXENT solution of the distribution of the causes Xwill still be a
multivariate normal distribution with expectations given by the constraints relating X. The conditional
distribution of the effects is the logistic-like regression of Equation (7), however, λ2will be 0, as this
is the parameter corresponding to the covariance between X2andY. In other words, X2becomes
irrelevant in the estimation of our target predictor.
In the anticausal direction , the distribution of the cause Yis unchanged because P(Y)is determined
by the constraints and thus does not depend on ϕ2. However, using the fact that the Gaussian
distribution maximises the entropy over all distributions with the same variance [ 37, Theorem 8.6.5.],
we can derive a bound on ϕ2. We use the entropy of the Gaussian distribution because we do not
know a closed form expression for the conditional covariance of P(Y|X)as given by Theorem 5.
7Proposition 11 (Bounds on unknown covariance between predictor and target) .Assuming the causal
graph in Figure 1b and we do not know ϕ2, an upper bound for ϕ2is given by:
p(1−p)¯s1,2ϕ1
p(1−p)¯s2
1−ϕ2
1. (17)
The bound in Propostion 11 is found by differentiating the determinant of the conditional covariance
(to which the differential entropy of the multivariate Gaussian is proportional to) with respect to the
unknown covariance, ϕ2in this case, and finding the value for ϕ2for which this derivative is 0.
The implication of the previous result is that even when we have not observed any joint data between
X2andYwe can still build a model of Ythat depends on X2, as long as we can assume the
data generation process is anticausal. We can consider this an instance of Out Of Variable (OOV)
generalisation studied in [ 16,12], where we can exploit causal information and partial data to make
models including variables that were never observed jointly with the target.
4.2 Unknown predictor covariance
Now suppose we observe all the sample averages in Equations (1) and (2) but we do not observe ¯s1,2.
In the causal direction this implies that the multivariate Gaussian distribution resulting from the
MAXENT problem on Xis diagonal, that is, Xare marginally independent. The exponential form
ofPλ(Y|X)does not change, as we still observed ˆpandϕ, nevertheless, the parameters of the
exponential family do change, as the distribution of Xchanged so that the resulting Pλ(Y|X)needs
to adapt in order to match ϕ.
Now we will explore the anticausal case. We will proceed as in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. First we find
P(Y)by maximising the entropy subject to the empirical average of Y, which is trivial because
P(Y)is already determined by its moments, and then we find P(X|Y)subject to all the moments
in Equations (1) and (2) with the exception of ¯s1,2. We obtain the following result from solving the
CMAXENT optimisation problem
Proposition 12 (Diagonal conditional covariance in the anticausal direction with unknown predictor
covariance) .The distribution P(X|Y)that maximises the conditional entropy subject to the
following constraints:
ˆE[XY] =
ϕ1
ϕ2
,ˆE[X] =
0
0
,ˆE[X2
1] = ¯s2
1,ˆE[X2
2] = ¯s2
2, (18)
andP(Y)inferred on the first step of CMAXENT, is independent after choosing a value of y; that is,
Xis conditionally independent given Y.
Remark 13 This result is reassuring given that under these moment constraints, P(X|y)turns
out to be Markov relative to the DAG in the anticausal direction. Contrary to Remark 4, where we
concluded that CMAXENT is not always Markov relative to a DAG.
In Appendix E we derive the slopes of the decision boundaries in the causal and anticausal direction
when we do not know the covariance between the predictors. We also find necessary and sufficient
conditions for which the slopes are the same. From this simple example, we have learned the
following: in causal direction, our inductive bias tells us that the covariates are not correlated and
hence, the decision boundary depends only on the marginal variance of each Xiand the covariance
between YandX. In the anticausal direction, CMAXENT infers X1andX2to be marginally
correlated because they need to be conditionally independent (this fact can proved using the law of
total covariance). Hence, the marginal covariance of X,ΣXis different in both scenarios. This is
something we did not observe in the case with full information (Section 3).
In addition, we derive the expressions of the decision boundaries in the causal and anticausal direction
(see Appendix E). That is, as proved in Propostion 9, we have that the decision boundaries of the
predictors in causal and anticausal direction will differ with the same moments, but different causal
assumptions . In Figure 2, we showcase this phenomenon with synthetic data.
5 Discussion
In this article we have studied the differences arising from merging of predictors in the causal and
anticausal directions. In particular, we have studied a simple case with a binary target variable and
8Figure 2: Decision boundaries of the solution of CMAXENT in the causal (left) and anticausal (right)
direction when we do not have the covariance between the predictor variables ¯s1,2.
two continuous variables. Although in this simple example we have already found connections
with classical classification algorithms, and differences in the solutions in causal and anticausal
direction, the example can be easily extended to more covariates (where the resulting distribution
of the covariates would be a d-dimensional Gaussian instead of bivarate Gaussian), a discrete target
variable (as in Corollary 7), and a causal graph that contains both parents and children as predictors.
As stated at the end of Section 3.1, the relation between merging of experts and logistic regression
has been explored in the past. Friedman et al. [8]interpret the solution to the AdaBoost procedureas
as additive logistic regression. They arrive at this interpretation starting from an exponential loss
function. They then propose likelihood based estimator of the AdaBoost procedure. Thus, since our
results align with those in Friedman et al. [8], we give yet another interpretation of AdaBoost as the
solution of the merging of experts in causal direction using the CMAXENT principle.
Even though we have used CMAXENT as inductive bias to merge the predictors throughout the
article, we believe that the asymmetries we found here (in particular, the geometry of the decision
boundaries) would hold when using any other inductive bias that allows causal information to be
included. Whatever method we use to merge predictors, the following asymmetry seems natural:
Inanticausal direction we try to explain correlations between X1, X2as a result of Yinfluencing
both components. In causal direction, correlations between X1andX2do not tell us anything about
the relation between XandY, following the principle of Independent Mechanisms (see [ 29] for an
overview and [11] for a recent Bayesian view).
The previous observation is useful in straightforward scenarios where we are merging data from
different sources for a supervised learning task, say datasets with overlapping variables, or datasets
produced from different experimental conditions (also called environments); but also in cases where
the merging of data is more subtle, for example, in federated learning where the notion of horizontal
and vertical federated learning [ 42] coincides precisely with the data sources described above but
where causality is underexplored.

12A Relation between the expectations of the Mixture of Gaussians and the
known marginal expectations
In Propostion 3 we proved that the distribution resulting from the constraints in Equations (1) and (2)
and the anticausal optimisation problem in Equation (9) result in a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
Now we are going to explore the relation between the moments of the resulting distribution and the
constraints used in the MAXENT optimisation problem.
We have the following expectations under Gaussian mixture model
E[XY] =pµ1−(1−p)µ−1 (19)
E[X] =pµ1+ (1−p)µ−1 (20)
E
XX⊤
=ΣX (21)
=E[Var(X|Y)] + Var( E[X|Y]). (22)
Where Equation (22) follows from the law of total covariance. We have
E[Var(X|Y)] =pΣX|Y+ (1−p)ΣX|Y (23)
=ΣX|Y, (24)
Var(E[X|Y]) =E[E[X|Y]2]−E[E[X|Y]]2(25)
E[E[X|Y]2] =pµ1µ⊤
1+ (1−p)µ−1µ⊤
−1 (26)
E[E[X|Y]]2=(pµ1+ (1−p)µ−1)(pµ1+ (1−p)µ−1)⊤. (27)
So that

=ΣX|Y+ (1−p)p(µ1−µ−1)(µ1−µ−1)⊤. (31)
Recall that the empirical averages used as constraints in the maximum entropy optimisation problem
are coincide with the expectations under the resulting exponential family distribution. Then, using
the equations above and the constraints, the means of the multivariate Gaussian distribution are

B Predictor in the anticausal direction
Theorem 5 (Predictor of Yusing Bayes’ rule) .Using the results from Propostion 3, the distribution
Pλ(Y=y|X)is the ratio of the product of the Gaussian component with Pλ(Y=y)and the
mixture of Gaussians resulting from Propostion 3. Minimising the expected 0-1 loss, the optimal
decision rule arising from this distribution is equivalent to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
14Proof. We prove this for the case Y= 1. the case for Y=−1can be derived in an analogous way.
The result follows from the application of Bayes’ rule:
P(Y= 1|x) =P(x|Y= 1)P(Y= 1)

C Derivation of the decision boundary
In the following two sections we give the proof of Propostion 9 for the causal and anticausal direction
separately. First, we restate the proposition
Proposition 9 (Normal vector to the decision boundaries in causal and anticausal direction) .Under
the 0-1 loss, the normal vector to the decision boundary of the CMAXENT predictor is proportional
to
1.Σ−1
X,causalϕin the causal direction.
2.Σ−1
X|Y,anticausalϕin the anticausal direction.
As mentioned on the proposition, we frame these results within the statistical decision theory
framework [ 3], choosing a particular loss function L(h(x), y), where h(x)is the predictor of ywe
want to evaluate. We consider the 0-1 loss function. That is, L(h(x), y) = 1 ifh(x) =y, and 0
otherwise. The optimal decision rule for this loss is the well-known Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
rule from which we can derive our decision boundary.
C.1 Proof of Propostion 9 in the causal direction
In the causal direction, the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule, results in the decision boundary given
by the following equation
P(Y= 1|x) =P(Y=−1|x) (45)
1
2(1 + tanh( λ0+λ1x1+λ2x2)) =1
2(1 + tanh( −λ0−λ1x1−λ2x2)) (46)
λ0+λ1x1+λ2x2=−λ0−λ1x1−λ2x2 (47)
λ0+λ1x1+λ2x2= 0. (48)
In words, the decision boundary in the causal direction is a linear function of the covariates. Using
this result, we proceed to prove the relation between the marginal covariance matrix and the normal
to the decision boundary as in Item 1 of Propostion 9
We want to prove λ∝Σ−1
XΣX,Y= Σ−1
Xϕ.
First, we define the random variable Z:=λ1X1+λ2X2. We can write P(Y= 1|x)entirely as
function of Z, thusX⊥ ⊥Y|Z.
To continue with the proof, we consider the Hilbert space of centered random variables with ba-
sis given by span ( X)and covariance as inner product. Following this geometric interpretation,
we define Wj:=Xj−αjZ, where αjZis the projection of Xjonto the span of Z. That is,
15αj= Cov[ Xj, Z]Var( Z)−1. We have that W={W1, W 2} ∈span ( X), so that Cov[Z,W] = 0 .
As a result, W⊥ ⊥Zbecause all variables in the span of Xare Gaussian. Together with W⊥ ⊥Y|Z,
this implies via the semi-graphoid axioms [ 23] that W⊥ ⊥(Y, Z), so that W⊥ ⊥Yand thus
Cov[W, Y] = 0 .
Taking the inner product with Yon both sides of Xj=αjZ+Wjgives us Cov[Xj, Y] =
αjCov[Z, Y] + Cov[ Wj, Y] =αjCov[Z, Y] = Cov[ Xj, Z]Var( Z)−1Cov[Z, Y]. This is valid
forj= 1,2, hence ΣX,Y= Σ X,Zσ−2
ZΣZ,Y. By definition, ΣX,Z=λΣX, so that ΣX,Y=
λΣXσ−2
ZσZ,Yand finally (ΣXσ−2
ZσZ,Y)−1ΣX,Y=λ, as required.
C.2 Proof of Propostion 9 in the anticausal direction
The normal to the decision boundary using the MAP rule in anticausal direction is derived in a similar
way to Appendix C.1. In particular, the normal is given by the points of xwhere we are indifferent
between choosing Y= 1andY=−1. To find such a vector, we solve for xin
P(Y= 1|x) =P(Y=−1|x) (49)
P(x|Y= 1)P(Y= 1) = P(x|Y=−1)P(Y=−1). (50)
In the second line of the above equation, we used P(Y=y|x)∝P(x|Y=y)P(Y=y).
We have

Remark 14 As mentioned in Theorem 5, the decision rule in Equation (53) is known as the Gaussian
discriminant analysis [ 14]. This is a special case of Linear Discriminant Analysis. The family of
LDA algorithms also contains Naive Bayes (if all the xare conditionally independent) and Quadratic
Discriminant Analysis (QDA) (if the covariance matrices for each Yare not equal, giving a curved
decision rule).
Now we will prove that if we have use all the moments in Equations (1) and (2) as constraints, the
slope of the two decision boundaries are the same.
Theorem 10 (Slope of the decision boundary is the same in causal and anticausal direction) .Using
the constraints in Equations (1)and(2), the slope of Pλ(Y|X)inferred using CMAXENT is the
same in causal and anticausal direction.
Proof. In Propostion 9 we proved that in the causal direction, the normal vector to the decision
boundary in the causal direction is Σ−1
Xϕ. Furthermore, using the law of total covariance (and the
assumption that ¯x= 0), we can write ΣX=ΣX|Y+cϕϕ⊤, where c= 1/(22p(1−p))(see
Equation (38)). Using the Sherman-Morrison formula [2], we can write
Σ−1
X=(ΣX|Y+cϕϕ⊤)−1(55)
=Σ−1
X|Y−cΣ−1
X|Yϕϕ⊤Σ−1
X|Y
1 +cϕ⊤Σ−1
X|Yϕ. (56)
Applying this operator to ϕ, and noticing that ϕ⊤Σ−1
X|Yϕis a scalar, we obtain
Σ−1
X=Σ−1
X|Yϕ+kΣ−1
X|Yϕ, (57)
where k= (−cϕ⊤Σ−1
X|Yϕ)/(1 +cϕ⊤ΣX|Yϕ). Thus Σ−1
Xϕ∝ΣX|Yϕ, as required.
16DMissing covariance between the outcome variable and one of the covariates
Suppose we do not observe E[Y X 2] =ϕ2. Can CMAXENT say anything about the distribution
P(Y|x)? The answer is positive under the assumption that YandX2are correlated. To see this, we
will use the following result in information theory: The entropy of a distribution with given first and
second moments is always less than the entropy of a multivariate Gaussian given the same first and
second moments [ 37, Theorem 8.6.5]. Hence, we can analytically compute the maximum entropy
solution of ϕ2via the entropy of the multivariate Gaussian as an upper bound on the entropy of X
given Y.
To do this, we will use the results of Appendix A, where we found an expression of ΣX|Yas a
function of ϕ2. Since ϕ2appears on several elements of the ΣX|Y, we first compute the determinant
ofΣX|Y, differentiate with respect to ϕ2and equate to 0 to find the optimal ϕ2.
For reference, the differential entropy of a multivariate Gaussian of kdimensions and covariance
matrix Σis
H(f) =k
2+k
2log(2π) +1
2log(det( Σ)) (58)

Although we have derived here the general case where the sample means are not zero, we will
continue the analysis by coming back to such assumption. That is, ¯x1= ¯x2= 0, giving us the
following expression for ϕ2which is easier to interpret
ϕ2=p(1−p)¯s1,2ϕ1
p(1−p)¯s2
1−ϕ2
1. (63)
In the numerator, we have that as the covariance between X1andX2increases, the MAXENT covari-
ance between X2andYincreases too. Furthermore, we see that the denominator is always greater
than 1 by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality of random variables, Cov(X1, Y)2≤Var(X1)Var( Y),
given that p(1−p)is the variance of Y,¯s2
1is the sample variance of X1, and ϕ1is the sample
covariance between X1andY.
E Derivation of the decision boundary with unknown predictor covariance
Causal. In the causal case, we have that the distribution of the causes is a multivariate Gaussian
with diagonal covariance matrix, and the conditional distribution of the target variable given the
covariates is the same as in Equation (7).
As a result, we have that the decision boundary is still proportional to
Σ−1
X,causalϕ=
¯s−2
1ϕ1
¯s−2
2ϕ2
(64)
as derived in section Appendix C.1.
18Anticausal. In the anticausal direction, we have that the target variable follows a Bernoulli distribu-
tion, and the conditional distribution of the covariates given the target variable is again a mixture of
Gaussians with diagonal conditional covariance matrix. We first prove Propostion 12.
Proposition 12 (Diagonal conditional covariance in the anticausal direction with unknown predictor
covariance) .The distribution P(X|Y)that maximises the conditional entropy subject to the
following constraints:
ˆE[XY] =

,ˆE[X] =

,ˆE[X2

2] = ¯s2
2, (18)
andP(Y)inferred on the first step of CMAXENT, is independent after choosing a value of y; that is,
Xis conditionally independent given Y.
Proof. The solution to the constrained optimisation problem has the same form as in Equation (10),
without the cross term:
Pλ(x|y) = exp[ λ1yx1+λ2yx2+λ3x1+λ4x2+λ5x2
1+λ6x2
2+β(y)]. (65)
Conditioning on any specific value of Y, gives us an uncorrelated multivariate Gaussian, as required.
Using Equation (31) we can express the conditional covariance as
ΣX|Y=ΣX−(1−p)p(µ1−µ−1)(µ1−µ−1)⊤(66)

(µ1,2−µ−1,2)(µ1,1−µ−1,1) ( µ1,2−µ−1,2)2
.
(67)
Since we know that ΣX|Yis diagonal, then ψ=p(1−p)(µ1,1−µ−1,1)(µ1,2−µ−1,2). From
Equations (32) and (33), we can conclude that p(1−p)(µ1,i−µ−1,i)2∝ϕ2
i. Wit this, we find an
expression of ΣX|Yas a function of the constraints

On Appendix C.2 (see also Hastie et al. [14, Sec. 4.4.5 ]) we proved that the slope of the decision
boundary in the anticausal direction is proportional to
Σ−1
X|Yϕ, (69)
and using Equations (32) and (33), we have that the slope of the decision boundary is proportional to

19NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All the theoretical claims in the abstract and introduction are part of the main
article.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Since this is a theoretical paper, most of the limitations come from the as-
sumptions made to obtain the theoretical results. In addition we discuss some potential
computational problems, when applying these results in real world problems. These limita-
tions are discussed in the main article, in any case.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
20Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: This is the bulk of the paper. We provide clear assumptions and proofs of every
result (except corollaries) on the paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: The paper does not contain any empirical results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
215.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: The paper does not include any data or code, besides a very small toy example.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: As above.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: As above.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
22•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: As above.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Due its theoretical nature, the paper adheres to NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We briefly discussed that practitioners should take some of these results into
account but there is no broad impact in the potential application of the ideas outlined in the
paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
23•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: There are no major risks posed by the paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not use any licensed assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
24•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: The paper does not involve human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
