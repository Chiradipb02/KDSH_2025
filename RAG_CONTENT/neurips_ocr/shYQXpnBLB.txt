Abstract
Text-to-Image (T2I) has witnessed significant advancements, demonstrating supe-
rior performance for various generative tasks. However, the presence of stereotypes
in T2I introduces harmful biases that require urgent attention as the T2I technol-
ogy becomes more prominent. Previous work for stereotype mitigation mainly
concentrated on mitigating stereotypes engendered with individual objects within
images, which failed to address stereotypes engendered by the association of mul-
tiple objects, referred to as Association-Engendered Stereotypes . For example,
mentioning “black people” and “houses” separately in prompts may not exhibit
stereotypes. Nevertheless, when these two objects are associated in prompts, the
association of “black people” with “poorer houses” becomes more pronounced.
To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework, MAS, to Mitigate Association-
engendered Stereotypes. This framework models the stereotype problem as a
probability distribution alignment problem, aiming to align the stereotype probabil-
ity distribution of the generated image with the stereotype-free distribution. The
MAS framework primarily consists of the Prompt-Image-Stereotype CLIP (PIS
CLIP ) and Sensitive Transformer . The PIS CLIP learns the association between
prompts, images, and stereotypes, which can establish the mapping of prompts to
stereotypes. The Sensitive Transformer produces the sensitive constraints, which
guide the stereotyped image distribution to align with the stereotype-free prob-
ability distribution. Moreover, recognizing that existing metrics are insufficient
for accurately evaluating association-engendered stereotypes, we propose a novel
metric, Stereotype-Distribution-Total-Variation (SDTV ), to evaluate stereotypes
in T2I. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively
mitigates association-engendered stereotypes.
1 Introduction
Text-to-Image (T2I) (Nichol et al. [2021], Rombach et al. [2022], Ramesh et al. [2022], Saharia et al.
[2022]), based on the diffusion model, has achieved significant breakthroughs in image generation,
showing potential for various downstream tasks such as image creation, editing (Brooks et al. [2023]),
etc. In addition, the scale of T2I applications has expanded impressively. For example, the open-
source stable diffusion project (Rombach et al. [2022]) has gained the favor of more than 10million
users. As of August 2023 , the number of images created through T2I has surpassed 15billion†.

38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).When generating images of white people, black people, 
or houses separately, there are no stereotypes.
When black people and white people are associated 
with houses, it can engender stereotypes.
Our MAS approach can effectively mitigate these 
association-engendered stereotypes.   
Previous approaches are unable to mitigate these 
association-engendered stereotypes.  ❌
Figure 1: Original T2I models can generate stereotypes when given prompts involving multiple
objects; when the prompts are “ a photo of black/white people ” or “ a photo of a house ”, they do not
engender stereotypes. However, if the prompt is “ a photo of black/white people and a house ”, the
model may engender stereotypes that the white people’s house is better than the black people’s house.
It is noted that previous mitigation approaches have yet to mitigate these association-engendered
stereotypes. Our approach, MAS, demonstrates the capability to effectively mitigate these stereotypes.
As images generated by diffusion models become more prevalent, mitigating the stereotypes they
engender is increasingly critical (Seshadri et al. [2023], Luccioni et al. [2024]).
The stereotype in social psychology is a mental construct of a particular type of person, object, or
thing, often based on observing individuals who fit that type. Previous work explored sensitive
attributes (such as gender, race, region, religion, and age) and corresponding stereotypes present in
T2I diffusion models (Wang et al. [2023a], Esposito et al. [2023], Bianchi et al. [2023]). For instance,
when the prompt is “ a photo of a politician ”, the object (politician) in the image generated by the
T2I diffusion model always appears male in the sensitive attribute of gender. Previous works (Shen
et al. [2024], Kim et al. [2023], Esposito et al. [2023]) on stereotype mitigation have been limited
to a single object, referred to as Non-Association-Engendered stereotypes (e.g., only mitigating the
stereotype problem in the occupation or gender dimension), and cannot effectively address stereotypes
involving the association of multiple objects, referred to as Association-Engendered Stereotypes . For
example, as shown in Figure 1, when the prompt is “ a photo of a white people and a house ” versus “ a
photo of a black people and a house ”, T2I diffusion models often generate images where the houses
associated with white people appear better than those associated with black people, reflecting an
association-engendered stereotype. Therefore, mitigating such association-engendered stereotypes is
highly desired for T2I models.
In this paper, our contributions are as follows: ❶To the best of our knowledge, we take the first
step towards addressing association-engendered stereotypes in T2I models. We define the stereotype
problem in the T2I diffusion model as a probability distribution alignment problem, aiming to align the
stereotype probability distribution of the generated image with the stereotype-free distribution. ❷We
present a novel framework MASto mitigate the association-engendered stereotypes, which primarily
consists of the Prompt-Image-Stereotype CLIP (PIS CLIP ) and Sensitive Transformer . The PIS CLIP
learns the association between prompts, images, and stereotypes, which can construct the mapping of
prompts to stereotypes. The Sensitive Transformer produces the sensitive constraints, which guide
the stereotyped image distribution to align with the stereotype-free probability distribution. ❸Given
the insufficiency of existing metrics for accurately evaluating association-engendered stereotypes,
we propose a novel metric for evaluating stereotypes in T2I: Stereotype-Distribution-Total-Variation
(SDTV ).❹We conduct a comparative evaluation of our stereotype mitigation approach on five popular
T2I diffusion models and six advanced stereotype mitigation approaches in T2I. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of our approach in effectively mitigating both non-association-engendered
and association-engendered stereotypes.

Stereotypes in T2I models. Although the current image quality and capabilities generated by T2I
are gradually approaching maturity, it is worth noting that various biases and stereotypes may still
arise from neutral prompt words (Zhou et al. [2024]). Fraser et al. [2023] and Wan and Chang
[2024] found that text-generated image models often engender stereotypes of gender, race, and
demographics in sociology. These biases can manifest in multiple aspects, such as occupations
(Bianchi et al. [2023], Cho et al. [2023], Luccioni et al. [2023]), objects (Mannering [2023]) and
adjectives (Luccioni et al. [2023], Naik and Nushi [2023]). Additionally, T2I diffusion models may
exhibit gender bias when depicting interactions between two or more people. Based on the above
findings, previous researchers proposed stereotype detection frameworks such as Language Agent
(Wang et al. [2023a]) and T2IAT detection (Wang et al. [2023b]). These research results provide
practical tools for identifying stereotypes and lay a solid foundation for further mitigating stereotypes.
Stereotypes mitigation in T2I models. Existing approaches to mitigate stereotypes in T2I diffusion
models have effectively mitigated some of the stereotypes but still have some limitations. Friedrich
et al. [2023] randomly introduced additional text clues by identifying known occupations in the
prompts to ensure a fair distribution of the generated images. However, this approach may ineffectively
address biases related to occupations that are not predefined. Kim et al. [2023] developed a de-
stereotyping loss function and adjusted specific parameters of the soft prompts to balance the sensitive
attributes of the generated images but only achieved de-stereotyping in the T2I model containing
occupational prompts. Chuang et al. [2023] proposed a technique that involves projecting biased
directions in text embeddings and debiasing by utilizing text data with a calibrated projection matrix.
Fine-tuning the diffusion model by modifying the capabilities of the pre-trained model has also
proven to be an effective strategy. Inspired by Gal et al. [2023], Zhang et al. [2023], Brooks et al.
[2023], Dai et al. [2023], Shen et al. [2024] fine-tuned the sampling process of the diffusion model
and used an optimized loss function to align the T2I model with fairness principles directly. Moreover,
He et al. [2024] utilized an iterative distribution alignment approach to align biased distributions
with a unified distribution. Schramowski et al. [2023] built a Safe Latent Diffusion (SLD) capable
of suppressing sensitive image portions during diffusion. Previous researchers adjusted the original
T2I model and had to consider the image quality and mitigate stereotypes in the original T2I model.
They mainly focused on mitigating non-association-engendered stereotypes in the T2I model (such
as those engendered by occupation/gender), so it is unable to mitigate the stereotypes generated when
multiple objects are associated effectively.
3 Our framework: mitigate association-engendered stereotypes ( MAS)
In this section, we construct a mathematical model of stereotypes in T2I. Based on this model, we
propose a novel metric, Stereotype Distribution Total Variation (SDTV ), for evaluating stereotypes.
Then, we model the stereotype mitigation problem as a probability distribution alignment problem and
build a new stereotype mitigation framework, Mitigate Association-engendered Stereotypes ( MAS).
Finally, we train PIS CLIP andSensitive Transformer models to construct sensitive constraints, which
guide the stereotype probability distribution to align with the stereotype-free probability distribution.
3.1 Modeling stereotypes in T2I
Inspired by Shen et al. [2024], we denote the object of the image as xand the object’s sensitive
attributes as s(such as gender, race, and adjective ). We introduce the probability distribution
function (PDF) P(s=v(s)|x)to quantify the likelihood of the image’s object exhibiting specific
sensitive attributes, where v(s)represents the value of the sensitive attribute. For instance, when

structure to construct sensitive constraints for each prompt. (3) In the stage of adding sensitive
constraints to the T2I, we embed the sensitive constraints into the T2I diffusion model to guide the
generation of stereotype-free images.
the generated image’s object xisperson andsisgender ,v(s)could be male orfemale . The PDF
represents the probability of a person appearing as male or female in the sensitive attribute of
gender. Furthermore, to distinguish the difference between association-engendered stereotypes and
stereotypes explored by previous work (Kim et al. [2023], He et al. [2024], Shen et al. [2024]),
we categorize stereotypes into four distinct categories (Table 1) based on the association between
objects and sensitive attributes: ❶a single object with a single sensitive attribute (S-O &S-SA,
non-association-engendered stereotypes), ❷a single object with multiple sensitive attributes (S-O &
M-SA, non-association-engendered stereotypes), ❸multiple objects with a single sensitive attribute
(M-O &S-SA, association-engendered stereotypes), ❹multiple objects with multiple sensitive
attributes (M-O &M-SA, association-engendered stereotypes). Here, we utilize a joint PDF to define
categories with multiple objects with multiple sensitive attributes.

where x1andx2represent the two objects in the image. For instance, in Figure 1, x1corresponds
to apeople , and x2corresponds to a house . The variables sx1andsx2denote the race andhouse’s
description . See Appendix A for more PDF definitions of other stereotype categories.
3.2 A new metric to evaluate stereotypes: SDTV
Stereotypes engender when a sensitive attribute in an image consistently presents one or a few states
in most instances (Naik and Nushi [2023]). Therefore, Saravanan et al. [2023] and Wang et al.
[2023a] have utilized various metrics to evaluate the stereotype from the perspective of the overall
proportion of different subgroups. However, when evaluating association-engendered stereotypes,
the proportion of subgroups in the population cannot accurately evaluate association-engendered
stereotypes. To address this shortcoming, we propose a new stereotype evaluation metric using total
variation distance based on the probability distribution model of stereotypes in T2I.
Consider a T2I model, denoted as G, which generates an image, and xis an object of the image.
We define a set Sxdenotes that object xcontains multiple sensitive attributes such that Sx=
{gneder, race, region, . . .}. We assign the sensitive attributes as v(sx)1, v(sx)2, . . . , v (sx)Yfor
each sensitive attribute sx,∀sx∈Sx(e.g. v(sx) = female , v(sx) = black, . . .). For an object
(i.e., x=“doctor ” orx=“nurse ”), the stereotype-free T2I model should generate images with
equal probability across different sensitive attribute values and should avoid significant probability
4distribution disparities caused by the dependence of sensitive attributes on the object generating.
To evaluate the extent of stereotypes, we calculate the difference in probability distributions for
each sensitive attribute value using the Total Variation distance Chung et al. [1989]: DTV(pθ(sx=
v(sx)i|x), pθ(sx=v(sx)j|x)). Therefore, based on the PDF definition of stereotype types in Section
3.1, the SDTV value of model Gunder single-object xwith single-sensitive attribute v(sx)is:
SDTV (G) = max
{i,j}⊆Y
DTV
pθ 
sx=v(sx)i|x
, pθ 
sx=v(sx)j|x
. (2)
In practice, for a given prompt text τin T2I models, the sensitive attribute’s probability of the
generated images under this prompt τis represented as pθ(sx=v(sx)i)|x, τ). For instance, consider
the sensitive attribute of gender ( sx=“gender ”) when the input prompt τis set to “ a rich person ”,
the gender-sensitive attributes’ probability of the corresponding generated images are considered and
set to pθ(sx=v(sx)i)|x, τ)(where v(sx)irepresents “ male ”) and pθ(sx=v(sx)j)|x, τ)(where
v(sx)jrepresents “ female ”) respectively. We could incorporate the prompt and sensitive attribute and
obtain the following:
SDTV (G) = max
{i,j}⊆Y
pθ 
sx=v(sx)i|x, τ
−pθ 
sx=v(sx)j|x, τ, (3)
where θis the parameter of model G. Given an input prompt τ,pθ(sx=v(sx)i|x, τ), and pθ(sx=
v(sx)j|x, τ)represent the probabilities that the sensitive attribute appears as v(sx)iandv(sx)jin
the output, where {i, j} ⊆ Y andi̸=j. If the value of SDTV (G)is considerable, it suggests that the
image exhibits very severe stereotypes. Conversely, suppose its value is close to 0. In that case, it
implies that, under the given prompt conditions, the sensitive attributes displayed in the generated
image are relatively evenly distributed, indicating no apparent stereotypes in this sensitive attribute
dimension. When calculating the SDTV of association-engendered stereotypes, we deal with multiple
objects and sensitive attributes simultaneously, so we need to adjust Equation (3). Let’s define a set
of objects X={Xh, X′
h}, where XhandX′
hrepresent the sets of human and non-human objects,
respectively. For a human object xh∈Xhwith sensitive attributes Sh, and a non-human object
x′
h∈X′
hwith descriptions S′
h, we can adjust Equation (3) accordingly to obtain:
SDTV (G) = E

Appendix B for the detailed proof process of the SDTV .
3.3 Mitigating association-engendered stereotypes
Our framework aims to alter the stereotype probability distribution in T2I to align it with a
stereotype-free probability distribution. As shown in Figure 2, we construct MAS to imple-
ment this alignment process, which consists of two main network structures, PIS CLIP and
Sensitive Transformer .PIS CLIP learns prompts, images, and stereotypes in T2I and con-
structs mapping of prompts to stereotypes; Sensitive Transformer builds sensitive constraints
based on prompts and mapping of prompts to stereotypes. Finally, we embed sensitive con-
straints into the T2I model by utilizing the Sensitive Transformer , which guides the probability
distribution associated with stereotypes toward alignment with the stereotype-free distribution.

We approach the solution by answering
two questions: ❶How do we learn the as-
sociation between prompts, images, and
stereotypes? ❷How do we construct
constraints?
PIS CLIP .In T2I, stereotypes are typ-
ically not in prompts but in images.
Therefore, we must learn the stereotype
in the generated image corresponding to
the prompt, which involves mapping the
5prompts, images, and stereotype descriptions. Inspired by CLIP (Radford et al. [2021]), we construct
a novel three-dimensional mapping approach to learn the features and relationships of prompt-image
stereotypes. We use a T2I-generated image, which contains a stereotype, as a bridge to create three
pairs: <prompt, image>, <image, stereotype>, and <prompt, stereotype> for training. PIS CLIP
learns the potential mapping relationship between the prompt and the stereotype by maximizing the
cosine similarity of these three pairs. We optimize a symmetric cross-entropy loss based on these
similarity scores. Algorithm 1 presents the process of the PIS CLIP (See Appendix C.1 for more
detailed experimental settings).
Sensitive Transformer .InPIS CLIP , we learn and establish a mapping of prompts to stereotypes.
Then, based on this learned mapping, we can create sensitive constraints for prompts. When given
a prompt, we aim to provide specific sensitive constraints tailored to that prompt. To achieve this,
we approach this as a query problem: the aim is to construct the value (V: sensitive constraints) by
matching a query (Q: prompts) with keys (K: the mapping of prompts to stereotypes). We implement
this task based on the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. [2017]).
Sensitive Matrix(V) = softmax(QKT
√dk)V. (5)
In Equation (5), the input consists of queries and keys of dimension dk. We compute the dot products
of the query with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on
the values.
Sensitive Constraints Guide Distribution Alignment. Consider a T2I diffusion model G, which
generates images xwith a sensitive attribute s. The attribute scan have Ydifferent categories and
needs to align with a target distribution Dthat is free of stereotypes. We use a prompt to generate
a batch of images, denoted as I={xv(s)
i}i∈N. For the PDF of the sensitive attribute of image x,
h(xv(s)i), leth(xv(s)i) =pv(s)i
x = [pv(s)1
x, pv(s)2
x,···, pv(s)Y
x], i∈ |Y| , where pv(s)
xrepresents the
estimated probability of generating images with stereotypes using model G. Assume another set of
images, ˜I={xu(s)
i}i∈N, generated with the same prompt Pbut without stereotypes. The probability
distribution of its sensitive attribute is h(xu(s)i) =pui(s)i
x = [pu(s)1
x, pu(s)2
x,···, pu(s)Y
x ], i∈ |Y| ,
and the corresponding probability distribution without stereotypes is denoted as pu(s)
x. We compute
the distribution distance between pv(s)
xandpu(s)
x.
σ∗= arg min
σ⊆SYsup|σ(pv(s)
x)−pu(s)
x|, (6)
where SYis the constraint space, SY={V(s1), V(s2), . . . , V (sn)}n∈N,V(s) = [v(s)1, v(s)2, . . . ,
v(s)Y], and σis a set of constraints within this space. The optimal constraint for minimizing the
distance between two probability distributions in the constraint space is σ∗. The σcontains all

When a sensitive constraint σis added to the input of the T2I diffusion model, it is combined with
the original prompt embedding to form a new input for the T2I sampling process. Since the new
input includes the sensitive constraint information, it guides the T2I process to produce a new output

4 Experiment
We conduct experiments on popular T2I diffusion pipelines to evaluate the generalizability of our
approach across various T2I diffusion pipelines, which include ❶runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-
5(SD-1.5) (Rombach et al. [2022]), ❷stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 (SDXL) (Meng et al.
[2021]), ❸ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning (Lightning) (Lin et al. [2024]), ❹stabilityai/sdxl-turbo
(Turbo) (Sauer et al. [2023]), and ❺stabilityai/stable-cascade (Cascade) (Pernias et al. [2024]).
All these models are openly accessible from Hugging Face *. As mentioned above, we apply our
stereotype mitigation approach to the five mainstream T2I diffusion pipelines. We use the optimal
sampler and keep the same hyperparameters setting to generate images for all T2I diffusion pipelines
(See Appendix C.2 for detail experiment setting). We create ten prompts for each of the four categories

of stereotypes discussed in Section 3.1, generate 100images per prompt, and calculate attribute
probability distributions by utilizing 100×10 = 1000 images. In addition, for comparison, we test
each pipeline using two sets of data, one from the original pipeline and the other from the pipeline
with MAS. We utilize the SDTV value to evaluate the severity of stereotypes in T2I models. For
four types of stereotypes, we apply the corresponding SDTV to evaluate the severity of each type
(See Appendix B for detailed calculation methods for the SDTV s corresponding to different types of
stereotypes).
4.1 Mitigation effects
Evaluation of stereotype mitigation effectiveness across different T2I diffusion models. Table 2
reports the performance of our stereotype mitigation approach. Our approach effectively mitigates
the association-engendered stereotypes in T2I and maintains excellent performance in mitigating the
non-association-engendered stereotypes. Besides, Table 2 shows that the latest T2I models (Lightning,
Turbo, and Cascade) display more pronounced stereotypes than their predecessors, SD-1.5 and SD
XL. Nevertheless, our approach performs robust generalizability, demonstrating superior performance
in mitigating stereotypes across various scenarios, including traditional and the latest T2I models
involving non-association-engendered/association-engendered stereotypes (Figure 3).
Comparative evaluation with different stereotype mitigation approaches. To validate the effec-
tiveness of our approach, we conduct a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods. Table
3 shows that our approach outperforms six other solutions, demonstrating fewer stereotypes for all
eight single-object and multi-object scenarios. Our approach offers a distinct advantage compared to
the prompt fine-tuning approach. We directly learn the relationship between prompts, images, and
stereotypes, which enables us to construct more targeted constraints for the stereotypes in T2I rather
than relying on broadly sensitive attributes as supplements. As a result, our approach can maintain
an effective mitigation strategy even when faced with more complex and concealed stereotypes.
Compared to the model fine-tuning approach (Shen et al. [2024]), our approach only requires integra-

tion within the T2I workflow to perform mitigation, eliminating the need to retrain the original T2I
model. During the training stage, the fine-tuning mitigation approach must ensure that it cannot affect
7the original T2I diffusion model’s alignment of text to image. Therefore, not all resources can be
utilized to learn stereotypes, significantly limiting the learning of more types of stereotypes. However,
our model can fully use computing resources to learn more types of stereotypes. This enables our
approach to demonstrate a practical mitigation effect in covert stereotype scenarios involving multiple
objects.

our approach integrates a Sensitive Trans-
former model into the original T2I work-
flow, it could introduce additional over-
head to the T2I model or impact the qual-
ity of the generated images. To evaluate
these potential effects, we conduct a se-
ries of experiments focusing on the qual-
ity of image generation and the efficiency
of the generation process. We set four
different batch sizes ( 10,20,50,100) for
the five different T2I diffusion models.
We evaluate the impact of using MASon
the quality and efficiency of generated images of original T2I by measuring the Fréchet Inception
Distance (FID) (Heusel et al. [2017]) value of generated images and the time taken to generate
images in different batch sizes. Table 6 demonstrates the evaluation results. Our mitigation approach
maintains comparable image quality and generation efficiency to the original T2I diffusion models.
Compared to other approaches, although our solution adds sensitive constraints to the original T2I
diffusion model, it only introduces low additional overhead.

scenarios. This section
aims to evaluate the ef-
fectiveness of MASin miti-
gating stereotypes in more
complex T2I scenarios.
In practical T2I genera-
tion processes, it is neces-
sary to incorporate models
such as LoRA and ControlNet to control the image’s style and structure. Consequently, our mitigation
approach must be capable of reducing stereotypes in multi-model collaboration T2I scenarios. We
conduct stereotype mitigation experiments by combining several mainstream models, including the
diffusion-based retraining model Realistic†(R-SD), LoRA models, and ControlNet models (Con).
Table 7 demonstrates that our stereotype mitigation approach maintains outstanding performance
even in T2I generation scenarios involving multiple model combinations. See Appendix G.1 and
Appendix G.2 for detailed descriptions of the experiment and examples of images.

95 Conclusion
In this paper, we took the first step toward mitigating association-engendered stereotypes in Text-to-
Image (T2I) diffusion models. We innovatively modeled stereotypes as a probability distribution align-
ment problem and constructed a probability distribution model for both non-association-engendered
and association-engendered stereotypes. Then, we proposed the Mitigate Association-engendered
Stereotypes ( MAS) framework for the first time. MASlearned the mapping of prompts, images, and
stereotypes and constructed sensitive constraints to guide the T2I diffusion model in generating
stereotype-free images by embedding these sensitive constraints into the T2I diffusion process. Addi-
tionally, we proposed a novel metric to evaluate stereotypes, Stereotype Distribution Total Variation
(SDTV ). Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrated that we contribute an effective mitigation
approach for association-engendered stereotypes in T2I, establishing a more ethical and reliable
foundation for future text-to-image generation development.
6 Limitations
This research effectively mitigated both non-association-engendered and association-engendered
stereotypes. While it successfully addressed the identified stereotypes, exploring other subtle stereo-
types will be an interesting direction for future research. To our knowledge, modeling the problem as
aligning existing distributions with target distributions holds significant potential for further extension
into research areas such as debiasing and detoxification in large models. Investigating these avenues
could provide deeper insights and more comprehensive solutions to ethical issues in generative
models.

12A Probability Density Distribution Modeling
A.1 Probabilistic model of four types of stereotypes
In our research, we define stereotype as the representation that links objects to sensitive attributes.
Specifically, for generated images, we denote the object as x, the subject’s sensitive attribute as Sx,
and the attribute value of s as v(sx). Based on this foundation, we introduce the PDF P(sx=v(sx))
to describe the likelihood of an image subject displaying specific sensitive attributes. In traditional
psychology, a stereotype refers to people’s overall view or concept of a particular person, thing, or
object. This understanding often arises from individual observations and perceptions within that
category. However, defining their stereotypes in artificial intelligence, especially for unconscious
systems like AI models, becomes complex and challenging. The lack of clear definitions poses a
significant challenge for our study. Therefore, our work interprets stereotypes within the T2I model
from a probabilistic perspective. By carefully examining different stereotypes, we categorize them
into four distinct types:
• Single Object with a Single Sensitive Attribute
• Single Object with Multiple Sensitive Attributes
• Multiple Objects with a Single Sensitive Attribute
• Multiple Objects with Multiple Sensitive Attributes
We utilize random conditional probability distributions for single object with single sensitive attribute
to describe their behavior.
f(x) =P(sx=v(sx)|x). (7)
The formula 7 represents the probability density distribution of the attribute value v(sx)of the object
xconcerning the sensitive attribute sx. For instance, consider the prompt phrase “ a photo of a nurse ”.
In this case, the object depicted in the image is a nurse. If we pay attention to the sensitive attribute
of gender, the object in the picture always displays “ female ” gender-sensitive attribute values ( v(sx)).
We utilize multiple dimension-sensitive attributes of a single object by using probability distributions
under various conditional constraints:
f(x) =P(s1
x=v(s1
x), s2
x=v(s2
x), . . .|x). (8)
i.e. still taking the prompt as “ a photo of a nurse ” as an example, but this time, in formula 8, we focus
on sensitive attributes such as “ s1
x=gender ”, “s2
x=race”, then the image always shows “ v(s1
x) =
female ”, “v(s2
x) =white race ” sensitive attribute value.
For generated images of multiple objects (x1, x2), we use a joint probability density distribution to
describe the stereotypes of multiple objects.
f(x1, x2, . . .) =P 
s=v(s)|x1, x2, . . .
. (9)
The formula 9 describes how multiple objects within the image collectively exhibit the same sensitive
attributes. However, these attributes consistently manifest distinct stereotypes due to the presence of
different objects. For instance, consider the prompt “ a photo of a doctor and a nurse. ” When the
object is a “ x1=doctor ,” it invariably appears as “ v(s) =male ”. Conversely, when the object is a
“x2=nurse ”, it consistently portrays a “ v(s) =female ”, thus reflecting gender stereotypes.
Likewise, we utilize the joint probability density function:
f(x1, x2, . . .) =P 
sx1=v(sx1), sx2=v(sx2)|x1, x2, . . .
. (10)
The formula 10 represents the stereotype probability distribution across multiple objects and multiple
sensitive attributes. i.e., when the prompt is “ a photo of a black man/white man and his house ”, a
common stereotype emerges: the “ white man’s ” house tends to be portrayed as more better than the
“black man’s ” house. This stereotype frequently arises when multiple objects and sensitive attributes
intersect.

BSDTV Main Proof.
B.1 SDTV ’s inference and proof process
In section 3.2, we have explained the variables in the SDTV formula. The single-object with single-
sensitive attribute proof process is as follows:
SDTV (G) = max
{i,j}⊆Y
DTV
pθ(sx=v(sx)i|x), pθ(sx=v(sx)j|x)
= max
{i,j}⊆Y
DTVZ
pθ(sx=v(sx)i|x, τ)dτ−Z
pθ(sx=v(sx)j|x, τ)dτ
= max
{i,j}⊆Y
DTV
Ep(sx=v(sx)i|τ)pθ(sx=v(sx)i|x, τ)−Ep(sx=v(sx)j|τ)pθ(sx=v(sx)j|x, τ)
= max
{i,j}⊆Y
Ep(sx=v(sx)i|τ)pθ(sx=v(sx)i|x, τ)−Ep(sx=v(sx)j|τ)pθ(sx=v(sx)j|x, τ)
= max
{i,j}⊆Y
pθ(τv(sx)i|x)−pθ(x|τv(sx)j|x)
Based on the above proof, we consider a sensitive attribute set Sx={gneder, race, region, . . .},
which contains different attributes. We evaluate the extent of single-object with multi-sensitive
14attribute stereotypes by calculating the average SDTV values of all attributes.
SDTV (G) =E|Sx|X
sx∈Sxmax
{i,j}⊆Y
DTV
pθ(sx=v(sx)i|x, τ), pθ(sx=v(sx)j|x, τ)
=E|Sx|X
sx∈Sxmax
{i,j}⊆Y
pθ(sx=v(sx)i|x, τ)−pθ(sx=v(sx)j|x, τ)
Similarly, we expand the object set X={x1, x2, ..., x n}n∈N, where the set Xcontains multiple
different objects, and calculate the average SDTV of all objects to evaluate the multi-objects with
single-sensitive attribute stereotype extent of the image:
SDTV (G) =E|X|XX
xmax
{i,j}⊆Y
DTV
pθ(sx=v(sx)i|x), pθ(sx=v(sx)j|x)

xmax
{i,j}⊆Y
pθ(sx=v(sx)i|x, τ)−pθ(sx=v(sx)j|x, τ)
Based on the above process, we simultaneously expand the object and attribute dimensions. Let’s
define a set of objects X={Xh, X′
h}, where XhandX′
hrepresent the sets of human and non-human
objects, respectively. For a human object xh∈Xhwith sensitive attributes Sh, and a non-human
object x′
h∈X′
hwith descriptions S′
h, we can adjust Equation (3) accordingly to obtain:
SDTV (G) = E
sh∈Sh
s′
h∈S′

{i,j}⊆Y,
m∈Zpθ(sh=v(sh)i|s′

h)m, τ)−pθ(sh=v(sh)j|s′
h=v(s′
h)m, τ)!
,
B.2 Why is it the maximum and not the average?
We compute the distances between the two distributions using the total variation distance ( DTV). The
evaluation typically utilizes the average in the study by Dwork et al. [2012] and Yang et al. [2022].
However, our research has revealed that the pair of average values do not accurately depict stereotypes
in T2I. Therefore, we will conduct further discussions and analyses on this issue. Ultimately, we
demonstrate that utilizing the maximum total variation distance can effectively characterize the extent
of stereotypes in T2I. Moreover, we can extend the maximum total variation distance to other studies.

0.00.20.40.60.81.0
Maximum line(b) The stereotypical extent is described using the
maximum and average values when the attribute
values in the probability distribution of DTVare
relatively balanced .
Figure 5: Comparing maximum and average DTVvalues to evaluate stereotypes in extreme and
common T2I scenarios.
As depicted in Figure 5, two scenarios exist for the distribution values of sensitive attributes in T2I.
In one scenario, the DTVvalue is high only for specific sensitive attribute values, while it remains
consistently low for other attributes. The diagram in Figure 5(a) shows that if we use the average
DTVvalue to represent model Gunder the sensitive attribute S, it will significantly reduce the extent
of stereotype in model G. Conversely, using the maximum value can accurately describe the extent of
stereotype in model Gunder attribute S.
Example. We analyze how model Gstereotypes are based on the attribute of race ( s=race). The
potential values for the sensitive attribute sarev(s) ={white, black, yellow, brown,... }. Consider
the scenario illustrated in Figure 5(a), where the DTVvalue for the white and brown categories is
assumed to be the highest at 0.9. In contrast, it falls between 0.2and0.4for other racial categories.
15When we calculate the average, the SDTV value of model Gis roughly 0.3. Model Ghas significantly
reduced its extent of stereotypes in the attribute dimension of race by almost three times . However,
theSDTV value, calculated using the maximum value, is 0.9. This value indicates that the model still
has a clear preference for one of the sensitive attribute values related to the sensitive attribute of race,
thereby displaying severe stereotypes.
Another situation is that the high DTVof some sensitive attribute values maintains a relatively
balanced state. As shown in Figure 5(b), at this time, using the mean SDTV value to describe the
stereotype extent of model Gwill still lower the extent of sensitive attributes of the model, and at this
time, SDTV will remain at a low level. Thus, we mistakenly believe that model Gdoes not exhibit
stereotypes.
Example. We analyze how model Gstereotypes are based on the attribute of race ( s=race). Among
them, the possible values of the sensitive attribute sarev(s) ={white, black, yellow, brown,... }. We
consider a balanced case, as shown in Figure 5(b), to calculate several races. When looking at the
DTV, it can be seen that the high DTVvalue of model Gremains in the range of 0.5−0.6, while other
DTVare around 0.2. When using the average, the SDTV value of model Gequals approximately 0.3.
The model does not show a very obvious stereotype. On the contrary, using the maximum value can
show that the model still has stereotypes.
Some other thoughts from the perspective of mitigation: when we use the maximum value DTVas a
description, at the exact moment, we only need to pay attention to the attribute value corresponding
to the most severe stereotype under the current SDTV performance. At this time, when facing the
extreme situation in Figure 5(a), we focus on mitigating the stereotype under this attribute value,
which can significantly alleviate the T2I model stereotype; when facing the situation in Figure 5(b),
When we mitigate the maximum DTV, the SDTV will still show the maximum DTVamong the
remaining attribute values, and then continue to mitigate the maximum to achieve the step-by-step
mitigation of stereotypes in the T2I model. On the contrary, when we use mean SDTV as a description,
we will disperse the focus of mitigation to all possible attribute values, and the effect of dispersed
mitigation will not be able to solve the stereotype problem effectively.
16C Experiment Setting
C.1 Training the PIS CLIP and the Sensitive Transformer
Dataset. Our training data sources are mainly divided into three channels: (1) The first channel
comes from the collected objects and sensitive attributes. We embed objects and sensitive attributes
into the prompt word template as the prompts input of the T2I diffusion model and generate 100
batches images for each prompt. (2) The second channel comes from existing datasets, including
COCO (Lin et al. [2014]), FairFace (Karkkainen and Joo [2021]), and LAION-5B (Schuhmann et al.
[2022]), and extracts the stereotype images in these datasets. (3) The third channel comes from the
prompt datasets. We extract prompts with sensitive attributes and objects from the existing prompt
datasets. Then, we use the five popular T2I diffusion models (SD-1.5, SD XL, Lightning, Turbo, and
Cascade) to generate images for each prompt. The composition of image data is as follows:

C.2 Evaluation and comparison experiments
As shown in Table 9, we set the parameters for different T2I diffusion models and generated images
as prompts in Appendix E. For each T2I diffusion model, we set 10prompts for association/non-
17association-engendered stereotypes and generated 100images for each prompt. We calculate the
SDTV value of each T2I model based on 10×100 = 1000 images. In Tables 2 ∼7, the “.XX/.XX”
represents the average value of 1000 images, and “ ±.XX/±.XX” denotes the error bounds. Addition-
ally, Tables 2 ∼7 illustrate that the greater the stability of the T2I diffusion model, the smaller the
error bounds. All evaluation experiments are performed on a single NVIDIA A100-80GB GPU.

21G Details for Stereotype Mitigation Experiments in More T2I Scenarios
G.1 Experiment setting
In this experiment, we utilize three models. Realistic, a retrained stable diffusion model known for its
realistic style, has been downloaded over 1 million times on Civitai‡. We use the LoRA model Add
More Details§to enhance the details in the images generated by Realistic. Additionally, we utilize
the ControlNet model to adjust the image structure. In the evaluation stage, we calculate the SDTV
values in different T2I scenarios with multi-model combinations using the same experiment settings
and evaluation methods as Appendix C.2.

26NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our abstract and introduction accurately reflect the contributions and scope of
the paper. In Sections 3 and 4, we provide detailed theoretical explanations and comprehen-
sive experimental validation of the contributions proposed in the abstract and introduction.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations of the paper in section 5.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate “Limitations” section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
27Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide detailed and sufficient reference sources and proof processes for
the mathematical models constructed in the paper in Appendix A and B.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide detailed information for all experiments in the paper to support
the reproducibility of the results. In Appendix C, D, E and G, we report comprehensive
experimental parameters, datasets, computational resources, prompts, and other relevant
information.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
285.Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the core code of the experiments and access links to the relevant
datasets in the supplementary materials.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide detailed information for all experiments in the paper to support
the reproducibility of the results. In Appendix C, D, E and G, we report comprehensive
experimental parameters, datasets, computational resources, prompts, and other relevant
information.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In the paper, we provide the error bounds for all experimental results and
report the calculation methods for these results in Appendix D. In Tables 2 ∼7, “.XX/.XX”
represents the actual calculated mean, and “ ±.XX/±.XX” denotes the error bounds.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
29•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Appendix C, we report the computational resources used for the experiments.
The model training experiment is conducted on four NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs, and all
evaluation experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA A100-80GB GPU.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All research in this paper complies with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics in every
aspect.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
30Justification: In this paper, we discuss the potential societal impacts of our work. Our
research effectively mitigates association-engendered stereotypes in T2I, thereby reducing
the generation of biased content by generative AI. This provides a strong assurance for the
safe development of generative AI.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: To reduce the potential risks of T2I diffusion models generating unsafe images,
we report the models, parameter settings, prompts, and other relevant configurations used
in our experiments in Appendix C, D, E, F and G. These configurations help ensure the
generation of safe images and reduce the risk of producing unsafe content.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All data, models, and baselines used in this paper are open source. We provide
citations or footnotes for all sources throughout the paper.
31Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the open-source code in the supplemental material.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper did not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
•According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15.Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
32Justification: The paper did not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
