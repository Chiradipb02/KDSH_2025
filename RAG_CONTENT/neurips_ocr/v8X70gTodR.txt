Abstract
Steering vectors (SVs) are a new approach to efficiently adjust language model
behaviour at inference time by intervening on intermediate model activations. They
have shown promise in terms of improving both capabilities and model alignment.
However, the reliability and generalisation properties of this approach are unknown.
In this work, we rigorously investigate these properties, and show that steering
vectors have substantial limitations both in- and out-of-distribution. In-distribution,
steerability is highly variable across different inputs. Depending on the concept,
spurious biases can substantially contribute to how effective steering is for each
input, presenting a challenge for the widespread use of steering vectors. We
additionally show steerability is also mostly a property of the dataset rather than
the model by measuring steerability across multiple models. Out-of-distribution,
while steering vectors often generalise well, for several concepts they are brittle
to reasonable changes in the prompt, resulting in them failing to generalise well.
Similarity in behaviour between distributions somewhat predicts generalisation
performance, but there is more work needed to understand when and why steering
vectors generalise correctly. Overall, our findings show that while steering can
work well in the right circumstances, there remain many technical difficulties of
applying steering vectors to robustly guide models’ behaviour at scale.
1 Introduction
Steering Vectors (SVs) [ 30,33,43,18] have been recently proposed as a technique for guiding
language model behaviour at inference time. Existing work has shown promising results in using
these SVs to detect and guide models towards high-level traits such as honesty [ 43], sycophancy
[30], and positive sentiment [ 31]. They have also been shown to be useful for improving model
capabilities [ 39,18,34] and red-teaming [ 29]. SVs are of interest as they enjoy a number of practical
benefits over other model adjustment techniques that require adding more information into the context
window [ 5,38, In-Context Learning], or performing training to adjust model parameters (fine-tuning).
Recent work shows that steering vectors can be learned in an unsupervised way [ 20], thus removing
another obstacle for their use. It may even be possible for different steering vectors to be used in
combination for multiple behaviours [ 34,36]. It would thus be very important and useful in practice
if steering vectors were truly effective.
However, existing work has mostly evaluated SVs in-distribution, and looked at aggregate behaviour.
It is unknown how reliable the change in behaviour caused by SVs is, and how well SVs generalise to

datasets produce the opposite behaviour for almost 50% of inputs. For all datasets see Figure 16.

different system or user prompts. In this paper, we extensively evaluate the in-distribution reliability
and out-of-distribution generalisation of SVs, extending analysis in Rimsky et al. [30] to a much
broader variety of behaviours from the Model Written Evals (MWE) datasets by Perez et al. [26].
In addition, we consider targeted distribution shifts in the form of inserting prompts via the user
message or system message. This setting mimics the practically important setting where we will need
to apply SVs to different system and user prompts, and where we would require SVs to generalise
well to be robustly useful.
Our first key result is that for many behaviours studied, steering is unreliable (Figure 1 and Sec-
tion 5). For all behaviours evaluated, steerability takes on a large range of values across different
inputs, including negative values, where SVs produce the opposite of the desired behaviour. Previous
work [30, 33, 43, 18] does not study this variance, which potentially leads to over-optimistic claims
on performance due to a lack of error bars. In explaining this variance, we demonstrate a novel
type of bias, steerability bias , in which models are easier to steer towards outputs with a certain
property (i.e. answer position or token choice). The lack of steerability and high variance in steering
performance demonstrates that in many cases, a steering vector extracted may not correspond to the
intended concept, and applying steering vectors may only be effective in the presence of spurious
factors associated with the prompt template or other potential biases.
Our second set of results focuses on the out-of-distribution setting. Here, we find that SVs generalise
reasonably well across different prompt settings, but the generalisation behaviour is not perfect
or entirely predictable (Section 6). SVs generalise better over some shifts than others and generally
perform worse out-of-distribution vs in-distribution. We investigate what causes this difference in
generalisation properties, finding that (i) steerability is mostly a dataset-level property, with similar
datasets being steerable and producing generalisable SVs for two different models; and (ii) SVs
generalise better when model behaviour is similar in the source and target prompt setting. This
relationship is a potential issue for SVs, as SVs will need to be applied to guide models towards
behaviours they do not normally produce.
Overall, our findings indicate that steering vectors in their current form are not a panacea for aligning
model behavior at inference time. Despite their promise, more work is required to ensure that steering
vectors reliably produce the desired behaviour in a generalisable way and are practically useful.
22 Related Work
Steering Vectors (SVs, also known as activation engineering) and related ideas were introduced by
Turner et al. [33], Zou et al. [43], Liu et al. [18]. SVs can be seen as an inference-time intervention
[16] technique in the representation engineering [ 43] toolkit, which is an umbrella term for the broad
approach of improving the transparency and controllability of neural networks by examining and
intervening on population-level representations and activations of the network. [ 28]. Rimsky et al.
[30] recently introduced Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), a specific technique for extracting
and applying SVs which we use in this work, due to its simplicity, effectiveness and popularity in the
community. Rimsky et al. [30] demonstrate the effectiveness of CAA in-distribution on several AI
alignment-relevant behaviours, while we test on a much broader range of behaviours, investigate the
reliability of the steering intervention, and examine out-of-distribution generalisation of SVs. We
describe the CAA method in more detail in Section 3.
Compared to fine-tuning [ 42,27,23], steering vectors don’t involve changing model parameters,
hence potentially avoiding catastrophic forgetting [ 3,19]. Compared to in-context learning [ 5,38,
ICL], steering does not require adding tokens to the prompt, saving inference cost and enabling it
to scale beyond the length of the context window. Furthermore, Zou et al. [43] show that steering
interventions are robust to adversarial attacks capable of breaking prompt-based and fine-tuning-
based alignment methods [ 26,37,13]. An extended related work section including discussing the
relationship between SVs and the Linear Representation Hypothesis [ 25, LRH] and other works that
evaluate the generalisation behaviour of model adjustment methods can be found in Appendix B.
3 Preliminaries
Rimsky et al. [30] propose Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) to extract and apply steering
vectors on datasets. We follow this protocol in our experiments, and so we summarise the main steps
here.
Multiple-Choice Contrastive Prompts. We construct a prompt consisting of a question or state-
ment followed by two multiple-choice options labelled “(A)” and “(B)”. The model is tasked with
reading the question and available options ( x), then choosing one of the options ( y+ory−). For some
datasets these two options are statements, and for others the two options are either “Yes” or “No”. A
typical example is shown in Figure 9. During preprocessing, we randomise whether ‘A’ or ‘B’ (and
‘Yes’ or ‘No’ where appropriate) are used as the positive y+or negative y−options, to ensure that we
do not simply extract a steering vector for e.g. the token ‘A’ vs the token ‘B’.
Steering Vector Extraction. For a given dataset Dconsisting of triples of the form (x, y +, y−),
and a given layer L, activations are extracted from the residual stream at the multiple-choice option
token position for the positive and negative option, to get aL(x, y +)andaL(x, y−)respectively. We
extract a steering vector vMDusing the mean difference (MD) of positive and negative activations:
vMD=1
|D|X
(x,y−,y+)∈D
aL(x, y +)−aL(x, y−)
(1)
We note that other aggregation methods have been proposed, but literature does not suggest these
perform better than mean-difference. We discuss alternatives in Appendix D.4.
Steering Intervention. To apply a steering intervention at layer Lusing a steering vector vL, we
addλ∗vLinto the activations at the last token position at layer Lduring model inference. Here, λ
is a multiplier that controls the strength of the steering intervention. For any metric of (change in)
behaviour, we can evaluate that metric for a range of λs to ascertain the effectiveness of a steering
intervention; more details including our specific choice of metric are discussed subsequently in
Section 4.2
34 Experiment Design
4.1 Datasets and Prompts
Datasets. We focus on the Model-Written Evaluations (MWE) datasets [ 26], a large dataset consist-
ing of prompts from over 100 distinct categories designed to evaluate many specific aspects of models’
behaviour. Each category contain 1000 samples generated by an LLM, covering a variety of persona
and behaviors. For each of these datasets, we construct a 40-10-50 train-val-test split. We also include
TruthfulQA [ 17] and the sycophancy dataset [ 26], as they were used in CAA [ 30]. The validation
split is used for hyperparameter selection; we discuss this in Section 4.3. We randomly choose
three persona datasets from each MWE persona dataset category, while keeping the sycophancy,
TruthfulQA, and AI risk datasets used in CAA for a total of 40 datasets.
Distribution Shifts. To evaluate how well steering vectors generalise to out-of-distribution settings,
we construct systematic distribution shifts by injecting additional text into the prompts. We design
the prompts to elicit more or less of the target behaviour through direct instruction. Sample prompt
injections are shown in Table 1. As we investigate instruction-tuned models, there are two valid
prompt injection strategies: (i) replacing the default system prompt with the injection, and (ii)
pre-pending the injection to the user prompt. We evaluate in both settings for completeness. To
evaluate generalisation across these distribution shifts, we extract a SV in one of the prompt settings
(e.g. BASE), and apply it to steer behaviour in another setting (e.g. SYS-POS), and denote this BASE
→SYS-POS. BASE →BASE hence represents the standard in-distribution evaluation.
To measure OOD generalisation, we define relative steerability . This measures how well a steering
vector vAtrained on dataset variation DAworks on dataset variation DBwith multipliers Λas:
srel(vA,DB,Λ) =s(vA,DB,Λ)
s(vB,DB,Λ)(2)
4.2 Metrics
To measure the effectiveness of steering, we need a metric of the model’s propensity to exhibit
a behavioural trait (e.g. sycophancy [ 30], truthfulness [ 17], helpfulness [ 2]). Given a propensity
metric, we then define propensity curves andsteerability as summary metrics of the steering vector’s
effectiveness.
Propensity. In our multiple choice setting, the model exhibits a target trait by outputting the positive
option (either “A” or “B”, see Figure 9). As such, a natural metric is to compare the logits of the
positive and negative tokens (either AorB) respectively. We define the logit-difference propensity
metric mLDas the logit of the positive token minus the logit of the negative token. Concretely:
mLD= Logit( y+)−Logit(y −) (3)
Rimsky et al. [30] instead uses the normalised probability of the positive answer, which is the same
except for a softmax applied to the logits. We note that normalised probabilities are a monotonic
function of the logit difference, so propensity is order-invariant between these two methods. However,
logit-difference is likely to be more linear with respect to the model’s intermediate activations (as it
doesn’t include a softmax), facilitating downstream analysis.
We note that propensity can be measured per-sample or in aggregate . Aggregate propensity is useful
for measuring broad changes in behaviour across a distribution, and we primarily use this metric when
studying steering vector generalisation in Section 6. A concern is that this loses granular per-sample
information; we analyse per-sample propensity in detail when steering in-distribution in Section 5.
Propensity Curve. To get a sense of how well steering works as a function of the multiplier λ, we
compute mLDfor various values of λ∈Λ ={−1.5,−1.0,−0.5,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.5}. We refer to this
as apropensity curve , which was proposed by [ 30]. If steering works well, we expect the trend to be
monotonic and increasing with high slope.

Steerability. To summarise a propensity curve, we propose a steerability metric. Given a steering
vector v, dataset D, and multipliers Λ = [ λ0···λn], we define steerability s(v,D,Λ)as the slope of
a mean-squares line fit to the mean LD scores for vsteering Dat each λi∈Λ. The steerability score
takes values s∈R. A high positive steerability score indicates that the steering vector is effective.
Conversely, a negative steerability score indicates that the steering vector has the opposite of the
intended effect. See Figure 2 for a visual example.
4.3 Steering Vector Extraction
Models. Following previous work, we focus on steering instruction-tuned models. We include
Llama-2-7b-Chat [ 32] as it was used in previous work. In order to draw conclusions that generalise
beyond a single model, we also consider Qwen-1.5-14b-Chat [ 1], which differs in many aspects,
including architecture, parameter count, and training data distributions.
Steering Layer. The choice of which layer to steer at is an important hyperparameter. Loosely, we
expect that each layer captures a different level of abstraction in the model’s internal computation
[8], and steering will work best if we choose the layer that best matches the target concept’s level of
abstraction. In order to determine the optimal layer, we sweep over all layers using the validation split.
In line with Rimsky et al. [30], we find that the optimal choice of layer is remarkably consistent across
many datasets. Thus, we fix layer 13 for Llama and layer 21 for Qwen for all subsequent experiments.
Layer response curves used in selecting the optimal layer are presented in Appendix D.7.
5 Evaluating Steering Vector Reliability
We first evaluate how reliably SV produce the desired change in model behaviour in-distribution.
For SVs to be useful they need to robustly shift the model’s behaviour in the desired direction for
all inputs, rather than working on some inputs and not on others. However, we find that for many
datasets this is not the case: steerability has high variance, with many inputs being steered in the
opposite direction to what is intended.
Steerability Varies Widely Across and Within Concepts. We find that both the sign and mag-
nitude of steerability can vary widely within a concept and across different concepts. As shown
in Figure 1, steering has a range of behaviours for different datasets. For some datasets with high
median steerability (e.g. corrigible-neutral-HHH ), the distribution is unimodal; high probability
mass is concentrated around the median (though still with high variance). At the low end of median
steerability, it is more common for the distribution to be bimodal, with there being two clusters
of steerability which are located further away from the median (e.g. myopic-reward ). In some
cases, steerability is negative for one of these clusters, which means that the steering vector is having
the opposite of the intended effect on these examples. We term this phenomenon anti-steerability .
Many of these datasets have almost half of the inputs being anti-steerable, implying that the effect of
steering is highly unreliable.
Steering is Affected by Spurious Factors. In order to understand the high variance in steerability,
we take a closer look at datasets with a high fraction of anti-steerable examples. In these cases, we
hypothesise that the steering vector extracted encodes spurious factors, as opposed to the underlying
behaviour. Hence, we study whether there are biases that predict steerability.

steerability per dataset for each way in which the positive option is presented. And entirely unbiased
result would have all bars being identical. Despite datasets being balanced amongst all possible
combinations of options, the mean steerability differs greatly between these splits. While there is a
general trend towards preferring ‘Yes’ vs ‘No’, there is still a lot of dataset-dependent variation, and
there is no clear trend for ‘A’ vs ‘B’. For full results see Figure 17. Note that some datasets have only
two bars, indicating that only the ‘A’/‘B’ split is relevant.
Due to the multiple-choice template used for steering vector extraction, one such potential bias
is towards whether AorBwas used to represent the positive option. In the case of the ‘persona’
datasets, where the responses are always either YesorNo, another potential bias is whether Yes
orNorepresents the positive option. Neither of these biases are present in the training data, as we
have randomised the data during steering vector extraction such that the examples are split equally
between the two (or four) choices. Despite this, we find these two biases are present (Figure 14) and
are often highly predictive of the steerability, explaining a large part of the variance in per-example
steerability (Figure 4).
This bias is different from the standard position or token bias exhibited by LLMs [ 40,35], as it is
asteerability bias: the model is more steerable towards the positive answer when it a particular
position or token compared to the other position or token. The preferred token or position is
different for each dataset; for example corrigible-neutral-HHH has aB-steerability bias, whereas
self-aware-lm has anA-steerability bias (see Figure 14). This is problematic, as it is not fixable by
simple dataset debiasing (which was already performed) or logit calibration adjustments [ 41] (as they
effect propensity, not the change in propensity, i.e. steerability). Further, it implies that there may be
other steerability biases present in models, determining when they are more or less steerable towards
specific answers or behaviours. Indeed, there is still a high degree of unexplained variance present in
many datasets in Figure 4.
Some Behaviours are Un-Steerable. We empirically observe that many behaviours turn out to
be unsteerable, as measured by median steerability shown in Figure 1. One possible explanation is
that the datasets we used were too small or low-quality. Other explanations include that unsteerable
behaviours are not linearly represented in the model, or that they correspond to multiple separate
behaviours within the model’s ontology. In the latter case, it would be interesting to develop
6Figure 4: SVs exhibit high variance, some of which is explained by spurious factors. The figure
shows variance in per-sample steerability by dataset, with attributions to known spurious factors
annotated. Marginal Var Explained refers to the variance explained by the ’Yes’/’No’ split after
removing variance from the ’A’/’B’ split. For some datasets, spurious factors (orange, green) explain
a large percentage of the variance, while for others, most of the variance remains unexplained. For
full results see Figure 18.
methods to disentangle these separate sub-behaviours in an unsupervised way. We consider follow-up
investigations for these two hypotheses to be promising directions for future work.
6 Steering Out-of-Distribution
SVs will often be applied in situations different from when they are extracted, particularly when the
system and user prompt changes, and so we aim to analyse how well SVs generalise in this setting.
We find that SVs generalise reasonably well but not perfectly, with some prompt changes having
better generalisation that others. We investigate what affects when SVs will generalise, finding that it
is mostly a property of the dataset, and that the similarity in behaviour of the unsteered model in the
source and target prompt setting is also predictive of SV generalisation.
OOD Settings. For each dataset, we define the ID setting to be when we extract the steering vector
from the BASE train split and evaluate it on the BASE test split, as defined in Table 1. We define four
OOD distribution shifts. Firstly, we consider the cases where a user prompts the model to stimulate
or suppress the target behaviour (BASE →USER_NEG, BASE →USER_POS). Additionally, we
hypothesise that the model’s base propensity affects the effectiveness of steering vectors. Therefore,
we also study the case where the user instruction conflicts with the system prompt for the model, as
encapsulated by system prompts (SYS_POS →USER_NEG, SYS_NEG →USER_POS).
ID and OOD Steerability are Correlated. Figure 5 shows that steerability ID and OOD are
correlated. We would expect that unsteerable concepts in-distribution are unlikely to steer out-of-
distribution, but it is promising for the usefulness of steering vectors that, conditioned on steering
vectors working in-distribution, they continue to work well out-of-distribution. However, generalisa-
tion is not perfect, and on average steerability is worse OOD than ID, particularly for Qwen. The
correlation for Qwen is also weaker than for Llama.
We also examine how the variance in steerability we demonstrated in Section 5 changes OOD.
Figure 6 shows that ID and OOD variance are reasonably well-correlated, with OOD variance perhaps
slightly lower than ID variance. This is somewhat surprising, although it may be explained by
slightly lower steerability OOD (as lower steerability means lower variance in steerability as shown
in Figure 20).

Qwen-1.5.-14b (right; ρ= 0.341) . Generally, variance is slightly lower OOD than ID (as the slope
of the lines is <1, although results are somewhat noisy.
Steerability is Mostly a Property of the Dataset. We compare aggregate in-distribution and
out-of-distribution steerability between Llama and Qwen in Figure 7. We find that both ID and OOD
steerabilities are highly correlated across models, despite them having different sizes, architectures,
and training procedures. The consistency between different model architectures indicates that the
effectiveness of a steering vector is mostly a property of the dataset used to extract the dataset, as
opposed to the model used. This may also be evidence that different models converge to similar
ontologies [11, 10].
Model Propensity is Predictive of Steering Generalisation. While steerability and SV generalisa-
tion is mostly a dataset-level property, there is still variation in generalisation performance that is not
captured by dataset; for example, SVs generalise better over some shifts than others for the same
dataset. In Figure 8 show that the similarity in the propensity of the model in two prompt settings is
correlated with the relative steerability (Equation (2)), a measure of generalisation. In other words, if
the model behaves similar in two prompt settings, then SVs will transfer better between those two
settings than if the model behaves differently in the two settings. We show a similar result but for SV
cosine similarity in Appendix E.3.

although it is stronger for Qwen than Llama. We filter out any datapoints where the base steerability
of the dataset variation is less than 0.25, as having low baseline steerability means any relative
steerability score is likely just noise.
7 Discussion and Conclusion
Our work is the first to report and analyse the variance in steerability at a per-example level, and in
doing so reveal a major limitation in SV reliability. In Section 5, we demonstrated SVs’s effects on
model behaviour are often unreliable, with some concepts being unsteerable and some SVs producing
the opposite behaviour to what is desired. We found that this unreliability is often driven by token-
and position- steerability bias , a new type of bias we discovered that is distinct from standard token
and position biases in LLMs. Although these are very simple biases which can be easily understood,
simple interventions in data preprocessing fail to address the problem, and there are likely to be other
steerability biases that will affect the effectiveness and reliability of SVs. In Appendix E.2 we show
that this variance is partially a dataset property rather than a model property, implying that future
work investigating what causes these biases should at least partially focus on the dataset, as well as
analysing whether other techniques for extracting and applying SVs can mitigate these biases.
9In Section 6 we evaluated the generalisation properties of SVs, finding that while they often generalise
reasonably well (conditioned on their in-distribution performance being good), generalisation is
not always perfect. We find that SV generalisation is mostly a property of the dutataset, and is
correlated by the similarity in un-steered propensity of the model in the source and target setting.
This correlation is problematic, as often we would want to apply steering vectors to guide model
behaviour towards something it does not normally do, but in these scenarios SVs tend to generalise
less well. Investigating methods to improve SV generalisation, and investigating scenarios where
they generalise better or worse is important future work.
Overall, while steering vectors are a promising approach to efficiently guiding model behaviour
at inference time, they are currently not a panacea to guarantee model helpful, harmless, and
honest behavior, and substantial work is needed to improve their reliability and understand their
generalisation properties.

B Extended Related Work
B.1 Steering Vectors and the Linear Representation Hypothesis
The effectiveness of steering vectors in- and out-of-distribution has implications for the linear
representation hypothesis (LRH) [ 25]. A key prediction of the LRH is that each atomic feature
is associated with a single global direction in activation space, and that intervening by adding or
subtracting this direction can influence the model’s understanding and / or behaviour. Previous
work that validates the LRH mostly considers the in-distribution (ID) setting [ 21,6,22,24,15].
However, this is only evidence of local linearity, which is satisfied by all continuous functions within
a sufficiently small neighbourhood. The LRH in fact makes a stronger claim: that representations are
globally linear. For SVs to generalise well OOD, this stronger claim has to be true — although it
may not be sufficient, and the reverse implication doesn’t necessarily hold, as the concepts that are
linearly represented might not be human-interpretable or extractable with SV approaches.
Therefore, our analysis can be seen as extending existing validations of the LRH to the more
challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) setting. Crucially, our proposed experimental protocol can
differentiate the LRH from competing frameworks which allow for local, but not global, linearity
[9,4]. While we primarily focus on the practical usefulness of SVs in this paper, we want to highlight
the additional value of our work from the perspective of the LRH.
B.2 Evaluating Generalisation Behaviour of Model Adjustment Procedures
Several existing works evaluate the generalisation properties of model adjustment techniques. Hupkes
et al. [12] introduce a taxonomy of work investigating generalisation in NLP. In the language of
their taxonomy, the investigation in Section 6 has a practical motivation and uses a generated
covariate shift for testing generalisation across domains at the fine-tuning (or in our case SV-training)
stage. Kirk et al. [14] investigate the generalisation properties of different fine-tuning approaches
in summarisation and instruction-following settings. Clymer et al. [7]investigate generalisation
of different methods for training reward models across a range of generated natural shifts, and
find that methods based on similar ideas to SVs often generalise reasonably well. In contrast, our
work investigates the generalisation properties of SVs specifically on a wide range of datasets that
capture desirable properties we would want to steer models towards or away from, and investigates
generalising over different prompts, rather than different inputs.
C Limitations
While our study uses a large number of datasets, even more variety in the type of behaviour being
steered towards could be studied to ensure our results are robust and reliable. As part of this, going
beyond the multiple-choice-question format would improve the usefulness and practical implications
of our work further.
While our work demonstrates multiple limitations of steering vectors and somewhat explains them,
these failures are still not entirely understood. Further, it is unclear what potential mitigations could
be applied to fix these issues. However, we believe this work is still important as it serves as a robust
and rigorous demonstration of these issues that future work can build on to improve the reliability
and generalisation of steering vectors.
We only analyse two models in this work, although they use different sizes, architectures, training
data and algorithms. Our results hold across both these models, but experimenting on even more
models, particularly at larger sizes, would improve the robustness and reliability of our results.

D.1 Contrastive Prompts
Contrastive prompts consist of a question or statement followed by two options, denoted by ‘(A)’ and
‘(B)’ respectively. We show a typical contrastive prompt in Figure 9.
D.2 Prompt Template
For each model under consideration, we use the standard instruction-formatting template. Concretely,
we add a system prompt and enclose the input in instruction tags. An example of this for Llama-7b is
shown in Figure 10.
D.3 Out-of-distribution Prompt Injections
Table 1 shows example prompt injections which define the distribution shifts for a specific dataset.
We describe the full list of persona prompts used in Table 2, Table 3.
D.4 Aggregation Methods
Besides MD, other aggregation methods have been proposed in the literature, such as principal
components analysis (PCA) and logistic regression (LG) [ 43]. Here, we focus on mean-difference
as it naturally results in steering vectors which have an appropriate magnitude relative to model
activations , such that a steering multiplier of 1 has the same semantic meaning across different layers
and different concepts. return steering vectors with unit norm, which could be different from the
natural scale of the model. Thus, additional work would be required to tune appropriate steering
magnitudes. We stick with MD, as Rimsky et al. [30] show it is a strong baseline, and PCA has been
found to give a very similar direction to MD [31].

D.5 MCQ vs Open-Ended Generation
For evaluating the effectiveness of steering vectors, the setting of ultimate interest is the open-ended
generation setting. However, it is difficult to obtain an objective metric of whether steering vectors
are effective in this setting. Previous work [ 30,43] finds that multiple-choice propensity generally
correlates with open-ended propensity. Hence, our analysis primarily focuses on the multiple-choice
setting, with examples being prompt-engineered to select one of the multiple-choice options.
D.6 Logit-Difference Propensity
Following standard practice in the mechanistic interpretability literature, we use the difference in
logits between a correct and incorrect answer as the metric of propensity. Our use here is justified
by two points: (i) Firstly, the correct and wrong answers are unambiguous. We find that, when the
prompts are formatted in multiple-choice format, the two highest logits consistently correspond to
the option tokens A and B, indicating that it is valid to consider only these two logits. (ii) Secondly,
previous work [ 30] finds that the logit-difference usually corresponds to generation. Conditioned on
the response beginning with A or B, the remainder of the response is typically consistent with the
option selected. We interpret this as evidence that the model ‘decides’ which behaviour to adopt at
the A/B token position.
D.7 Optimal Layer Selection
In Figure 11 and Figure 12 we report layer response curves plotted for a subset of datasets across all
layers of Llama-2-7b-chat and Qwen-1.5-14b-chat respectively. We find that, across many datasets,
the choice of optimal layer is remarkably consistent, justifying the use of a single layer for steering.
One concern with this approach is that datasets which have low steerability were simply steered
optimally at other layers. To address this, we re-run the layer sweep on the worst-performing datasets,
shown in Figure 13. We find that the optimal layer remains the same for these datasets, confirming
that low steerability is not merely due to having steered at the wrong layer.
D.8 Optimal Multiplier Selection
In our experiments, we fix a range of (−1.5,1.5)within which we select multipliers to perform
contrastive activation addition. To justify this choice, we ablate the range of multipliers used in
Figure 15. We find that the overall trends in steerability remain highly consistent across multiplier
ranges, giving us confidence that the conclusions on steerability are robust to the choice of multiplier.
D.9 OOD Steering Vector Magnitude
When steering in-distribution, we expect that the extracted steering vector is already of a magnitude
that is scaled appropriately relative to the model’s activations. However, when extracting steering

result would have all bars being identical. Despite datasets being balanced amongst all possible
combinations of options, the mean steerability differs greatly between these splits. While there is a
general trend towards preferring ‘Yes’ vs ‘No’, there is still a lot of dataset-dependent variation, and
there is no clear trend for ‘A’ vs ‘B’. For full results see Figure 17. Note that some datasets have only
two bars, indicating that only the ‘A’/‘B’ split is relevant.
vectors on different dataset variants, the resulting steering vectors may be of different magnitudes.
Unaddressed, this could create situations where a steering vector appears to steer better or worse
than another steering vector, when in reality it is simply an artifact of one steering vector having a
larger or smaller magnitude than another steering vector. Thus, we normalise the magnitudes of all
steering vectors to the magnitude of the baseline steering vector, such that we can fairly compare
these steering vectors using interventions of the same multiplier on the same evaluation dataset.

E Supplementary Results
E.1 In-Distribution Steerability
We present the equivalent of Figure 1, Figure 14, Figure 4 for all datasets evaluated. See Figure 16,
Figure 17, Figure 18 respectively.
E.2 Steerability Variance Across Models
In Figure 19 we show that the high variance in steerability we demonstrate in Section 5 is somewhat
correlated across models, implying this variance is partially a property of the dataset rather than a
specific model. This implies that improving the reliability of SVs requires either more substantial
adjustments to models, or improvements to dataset quality or SV extraction.
In Figure 20 we show steerability and steerability variance are somewhat correlated, for both models,
but the relationship is somewhat noisy.
In addition, we include additional steerability correlations for Gemma-2-2b-it and Llama-3.1-70b in
Figure 21
E.3 OOD steering vector similarities
In Figure 22, we produce similar plots to Figure 8 but using cosine similarity of SVs rather than
relative steerability as the y-axis. We find that dataset variations that have similar unsteered LD result
in more similar steering vectors, analogous to the result in Figure 8.

correlation between steerability variance in Llama-2-7b and Qwen-1.5-14b both ID (left; ρ= 0.465)

lower variance in steerability under one model than the other, indicating that models may differ in the
degree to which they incorporate spurious factors into linear concept representations.
