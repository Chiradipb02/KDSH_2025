Abstract
With the continued advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) Agents
in reasoning, planning, and decision-making, benchmarks have become cru-
cial in evaluating these skills. However, there is a notable gap in benchmarks
for real-time strategic decision-making. StarCraft II (SC2), with its complex
and dynamic nature, serves as an ideal setting for such evaluations. To this
end, we have developed TextStarCraft II, a specialized environment for assess-
ing LLMs in real-time strategic scenarios within SC2. Addressing the limita-
tions of traditional Chain of Thought (CoT) methods, we introduce the Chain
of Summarization (CoS) method, enhancing LLMs’ capabilities in rapid and ef-
fective decision-making. Our key experiments included: 1. LLM Evaluation:
Tested 10 LLMs in TextStarCraft II, most of them defeating LV5 build-in AI,
showcasing effective strategy skills. 2. Commercial Model Knowledge: Eval-
uated four commercial models on SC2 knowledge; GPT-4 ranked highest by
Grandmaster-level experts. 3. Human-AI Matches: Experimental results showed
that ﬁne-tuned LLMs performed on par with Gold-level players in real-time
matches, demonstrating comparable strategic abilities. All code and data from this
study have been made pulicly available at https://github.com/histmeisah/

1 Introduction
Real-time strategy decision-making and long-term planning are critical AI challenges, necessitating
rapid, tactical decisions and strategic adaptability over time. StarCraft II (SC2), one of the world’s
most popular and challenging e-sports, exempliﬁes these demands through its dynamic gameplay.
Players must manage resources, construct bases, and command armies while making quick deci-
sions and adapting their long-term strategies to evolving battleﬁeld conditions. The game’s layered
gameplay spans economic management, military strategy, and tactical execution, making SC2 a
valuable model for AI research, particularly in reinforcement learning (RL). SC2’s complexity, real-
time nature, and the fact that it is considered one of the hardest games in the world pose signiﬁcant
challenges for AI systems, requiring them to master various aspects of the game simultaneously.

38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).by DeepMind’s AlphaStar [ 24], have demonstrated signiﬁcant advancements in this domain, show-
casing AI’s growing proﬁciency in strategic gameplay. With the evolution of LLMs in areas like
reasoning, planning, and decision-making, these models have begun to show potential in tasks tra-
ditionally dominated by RL approaches[ 33]. Benchmarks such as AGENTBENCH [ 15] have been
instrumental in evaluating these capabilities in multi-turn, open-ended contexts. However, despite
these developments, a speciﬁc benchmark for assessing LLMs’ capabilities in real-time strategy
decision-making and long-term planning in environments like StarCraft II is conspicuously absent.
Therefore, we have chosen SC2 as the benchmark for evaluating the real-time strategy decision-
making and long-term planning capabilities of LLMs. Given the lack of language support in existing
SC2 environments, we developed TextStarCraft II. Utilizing the python-sc2 framework, TextStar-
Craft II converts the complex gameplay dynamics of SC2 into an interactive, text-based format. The
python-sc2 interface1is utilized to convert game data into text, enabling LLM agents to perform
macro-strategic actions through language commands. For micro-strategic actions, we implement
a rule-based approach akin to that used by OpenAI Five [ 2], employing predeﬁned Python scripts.
This allows LLM agents to engage in competition against the game’s built-in AI, other LLM agents,
and human players through the execution of these scripted actions. Addressing the challenges posed
by the intricate decision-making process in SC2, we propose the Chain of Summarization(CoS)
method. This approach enhances the capacity of LLM Agents in processing complex information
and making strategic decisions by incorporating single-frame and multi-frame summarization mod-
ules, each aiding in understanding the immediate game state and processing sequential data for
strategy formulation and decision-making.
In this study, we conduct a thorough exploration of LLMs’ application and effectiveness within
SC2 via the TextStarCraft II environment. Our experimental framework includes assessing the CoS
method, evaluating the performance of proprietary and ﬁne-tuned open-source LLMs in TextStar-
Craft II, testing real-time human-computer interaction, and using StarCraft II-themed question-
answering tasks evaluated by human experts. We also analyze the impact of varying prompts on
LLMs, their strategic preferences, and the interpretability of their decision-making processes.
Our contributions are manifold:
•TextStarCraft II Development: We present TextStarCraft II, a novel environment that
not only enables the evaluation of LLMs in strategic gaming contexts but also supports
real-time human-computer interactions.
•Chain of Summarization Method and Agent: By introducing the CoS method and re-
leasing an open-source agent, we offer a powerful example and a high-level interface for
the community, fostering further development and interaction with TextStarCraft II.
•Diverse Evaluations of LLMs: Our extensive evaluations encompass testing LLMs
against the game’s built-in AI, assessing their understanding of StarCraft II through ex-
perts reviews, and conducting human-AI matches. These methodologies underscore LLMs’
proﬁciency in strategic decision-making and their potential for human-like gameplay.
2 Background: StarCraft II
StarCraft II (SC2) is a real-time strategy (RTS) game developed by Blizzard Entertainment,
renowned for its strategic depth and complexity. It features three distinct playable races: Terrans
(humans with advanced technology), Protoss (a psionic species with powerful abilities), and Zerg (a
biologically advanced, insectoid race), each with unique units, structures, and gameplay mechanics.
The game’s core elements include resource management, base construction, unit production, and
tactical combat. Players must efﬁciently gather resources (minerals and vespene gas), construct and
expand bases, compose balanced armies, and execute strategic plans while adapting to opponents’
moves. This multi-faceted gameplay requires players to make rapid decisions under incomplete
information, balancing short-term tactics with long-term strategy. SC2’s complexity is further en-
hanced by its asymmetric design, where each race has distinct strengths and weaknesses, leading to a
rich variety of strategies and counter-strategies. The game also incorporates elements of economics,
technology progression, and territorial control, making it a comprehensive test of strategic thinking
and multitasking ability.

2Since its release in 2010, SC2 has been a cornerstone of competitive gaming, featuring prominently
in major e-sports tournaments worldwide. The game’s professional scene is characterized by high-
level play, particularly from South Korean competitors, though it maintains a strong international
presence. SC2’s strategic complexity has made it a subject of extensive study, not only within the
gaming community but also in academic ﬁelds such as artiﬁcial intelligence and cognitive science.
Researchers have utilized SC2 as a testbed for developing and evaluating AI algorithms, particularly
in areas of hierarchical planning, multi-agent coordination, and decision-making under uncertainty.
The game’s rich strategic landscape, combined with its clear victory conditions and quantiﬁable
performance metrics, makes it an ideal environment for benchmarking AI systems against human
expertise in complex, real-time domains. Moreover, SC2 has been used to study human cognition,
particularly in areas of attention allocation, decision-making under time pressure, and skill acquisi-
tion. The game’s replay system, which records every action taken by players, provides researchers
with a wealth of data for analyzing human performance and strategy evolution over time.
3 Related Work
StarCraft II Full Game AI : StarCraft AI research, initially focused on StarCraft I with develop-
ments like BiCNet [ 19] for multi-agent coordination, has signiﬁcantly advanced in the StarCraft
II era. The release of PySC2 [ 23] by DeepMind, coupled with Blizzard’s game replays, propelled
this research ﬁeld. A key breakthrough was AlphaStar [ 24], which achieved Grandmaster level and
defeated top players, demonstrating the potential of RL in complex environments.
Subsequent research expanded upon these foundations. Mini-AlphaStar [ 13] simpliﬁed input vari-
ables without compromising learning effectiveness. TG [ 12] and HierNet-SC2 [ 14] explored efﬁ-
cient RL strategies, with the latter bypassing supervised pre-training. AlphaStar Unplugged [ 16]
represented a leap in ofﬂine RL using human replays. TStarBotsX [ 7] and SCC [ 26] furthered feder-
ated learning approaches, achieving notable success against master and grandmaster level players.
Recent advancements include DI-star2, which is accessible for home computer deployment, and
ROA-Star [ 9], enhancing AlphaStar’s training framework with goal-conditioned exploiters and re-
ﬁned opponent modeling techniques. ROA-Star’s practical tests against professional players have
shown impressive results, marking signiﬁcant progress in real-time strategy AI.
LLM Agent and Benchmark: The introduction of GPT3.5 [ 17] has signiﬁcantly propelled the re-
search on LLM agents forward. Projects such as React [ 29] and AutoGPT3laid the groundwork for
more sophisticated implementations. Within the MineDojo environment [ 5]4, initiatives like GITM
[34], Voyager [ 25], and others [ 6,28,10] have underscored LLM agents’ adaptability to a variety
of tasks and expansive open-world scenarios. Additionally, environments like TextWorld [ 4] and
ALFWorld [ 20] enrich agent training by integrating text-based strategy and action execution across
simulated and visual contexts, facilitating advanced generalization and adaptive learning. Addi-
tionally, optimization methods such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)[ 31]
have also improved the performance of large language models.
Further advancements in multi-agent coordination and virtual social dynamics have been achieved
through MetaGPT [ 8], Camel [ 11], and Generative Agents [ 18]. Benchmarking platforms such as
AGENTBENCH play a critical role in evaluating these developments, with AGENTBENCH exam-
ining decision-making in comprehensive, open-ended contexts.
In StarCraft II, despite the development of advanced AI agents, there remains a gap in evaluating
LLMs, especially in real-time strategy and long-term planning. This led to the creation of TextStar-
Craft II, an environment tailored for testing LLMs in these speciﬁc aspects, ﬁlling a critical need for
natural language interaction capabilities in AI research.
4 TextStarCraft II
TextStarCraft II provides a text-based interface for LLMs within the SC2 environment, utilizing
the python-sc2 framework to translate complex gameplay into text. Key components include the
Observation-to-Text Adapter and the Text-to-Action Adapter .TextStarCraft II stands out from

4https://github.com/MineDojo/MineDojo
3other text-based environments like TextWorld and ALFWorld due to its more complex and dynamic
gameplay. It requires agents to manage multiple aspects such as resource allocation, base building,
and military strategy in real-time, challenging both their adaptability and decision-making. Addi-
tionally, the environment demands advanced language understanding to interpret and execute more
open-ended and diverse commands, enhancing the need for sophisticated natural language process-
ing capabilities. We will introduce the main components of TextStarCraft II below.
Observation TextStarCraft II’s observation space is designed to equip LLM agents with essential
game insights, effectively navigating the fog of war in StarCraft II. The observations encompass six
key categories:
•Resources: Game resources and supply levels. ("Minerals: 500, Vespene Gas:200 ")
•Units: Types and quantities of the players units.(e.g., "15 Zealots, 5 Carriers")
•Buildings: Information on the players buildings.(e.g., "2 Gateway, 1 Nexus")
•In-Process Activities: Ongoing construction and production data.(e.g., "Researching Warp-
gate: 70
•Enemy Status: Visible enemy units and buildings
•Research Progress: Updates on the player’s technological advancements.
This structured approach in the observation space enables LLM agents to efﬁciently process and
utilize vital game data for strategic decision-making in TextStarCraft II.
Action There are mainly two types of actions: Macro Actions andMicro Actions .
•Macro Actions: Covering broad strategic decisions such as Training Units, Building Struc-
tures, Researching Technologies, and Other Strategic Maneuvers. Examples include:
–Building construction (e.g., “Build Cybernetics Core”)
–Unit production (e.g., “Train 5 Probes (Protoss worker)”)
–Research (e.g., “Research Blink Tech”)
–Tactical maneuvers (e.g., “Scout with 1 probe”, “Attack enemy base”)
•Micro Actions: Script-managed for precise placements and targeting, not directly con-
trolled by the agent.
Reward The reward function Ris crucial for aligning agent behavior with the game’s objectives,
assigning values of {−1,0,1}based on losing, drawing, or winning a match.
Game Modes TextStarCraft II enriches strategic gameplay with several modes. The Built-in AI
mode features 10 difﬁculty levels, ranging from VeryEasy(LV1) to CheatInsane(LV10), and incorpo-
rates six strategic styles: RandomBuild, Rush, Timing, Power, Macro, and Air. The Agent AI mode
enables competition against rule-based AIs and other LLM agents. The Human mode supports
interactions with real-world players, enhancing gameplay realism.
Victory Conditions In our TextStarCraft2 environment, victory conditions align with those of
a standard StarCraft II 1v1 game, akin to benchmarks such as AlphaStar, ROA-Star, or DI-Star.
Victory requires the LLM agent to destroy all opponent structures, standardizing our benchmark
with practices in various StarCraft II AI competitions.
5 Chain of Summarization
The Chain of Summarization (CoS) method, integral to the TextStarCraft II framework, draws inspi-
ration from computer hardware’s cache mechanisms and RL’s frame skipping techniques. Serving as
an enhancement to traditional Chains of Thought (CoT) [ 27] and as a standard plug-in, CoS reﬁnes
strategic decision-making in StarCraft II through:
•Information Compression: It focuses on key data, reducing overload and sharpening
strategic clarity.

rule-basedFigure 1: Interacting with LLM using the Enhanced Chain of Summarization (CoS) Method
in TextStarCraft II . This streamlined LLM-driven gameplay. It begins with initialization, where
initial game data is converted to text for processing. Next, Single-Frame and Multi-Frame Summa-
rization reﬁne and summarize observations into actionable insights using advanced LLM reasoning.
In Directive Formulation and Action Scheduling, these insights are segmented into speciﬁc actions
and queued for execution. The process concludes with Action Retrieval and Execution, where ac-
tions are implemented in the game. This cycle continually converts new data into text, enhancing
LLM performance in the TextStarCraft II.
•Inference Acceleration: This approach speeds up decision-making by providing a more
comprehensive view of the game’s state.
•Global Understanding: CoS equips LLMs with a deeper grasp of game strategies, leading
to expert-level decisions.
As a versatile tool within the TextStarCraft II framework, CoS can operate both as a standalone plug-
in, enhancing the environment’s utility, and as a direct interface for user interaction with TextStar-
Craft II. This dual functionality not only showcases CoS as an exemplary model for engaging with
our environment but also invites further development and customization by the community, broad-
ening the scope of strategic AI research in gaming. CoS includes Single-Frame Summarization,
Multi-Frame Summarization, and Action Extraction for the Action Queue.
Single-Frame Summarization To make TextStarCraft’s raw observation data more comprehensi-
ble for LLMs, Single-frame Summarization compresses and extracts key information. This process,
denoted as SSF(·), transforms dense TextStarCraft II observations ointo a condensed form ˆo, de-
scribed by:
ˆo=SSF(o). (1)
There are two approaches to this compression: a language model-based approach using few-shot
learning for better alignment with game rules and a faster, rule-based approach for extraction and
ﬁltering. In our experiments, the rule-based approach is primarily used for quicker interactions.
Multi-Frame Summarization Traditional methods query LLMs at each time step for decision-
making ([ 3], [32]). However, this is inefﬁcient for long-duration games like StarCraft II due to high
computation costs and slower LLM inference. Our Multi-Frame Summarization method, inspired
by caching in computer hardware and frame skipping in RL, addresses these issues. It synchronizes
the quick pace of the game with LLM processing, ensuring real-time decision-making efﬁciency and
improved comprehension in complex scenarios. Instead of constant LLM querying, we aggregate

This method enables comprehensive analysis and strategic planning through a series of steps, includ-
ing situation overview, analysis, strategic planning, opponent strategy analysis, suggestion formula-
tion, and decision-making. This process is formalized as υ, which is the output of CoT reasoning
for summarization σ, given by:
υ=CoT(σ). (3)
Action Extraction for Action Queue The action queue forms a critical link between the Multi-
Frame Summarization results, υ, and the TextStarCraft II environment, facilitating communication
between the LLM and the game. Within υ, key components include analysis, suggestions, and deci-
sions. To convert these into actionable steps, we employ regular expression matching and similarity
searching in our action extractor, donated as Ex(·). This process populates the action queue with
actions ready for execution in TextStarCraft II. From the output υofCoT reasoning, we utilize the
action extractor to extract Kactions, as formalized in:
(a1, a2,···, aK) =Ex(υ). (4)
The CoS method optimizes decision-making in TextStarCraft II through a streamlined four-stage
process: Initially, it sets the initial parameters and transforms the ﬁrst game frame into text for sub-
sequent analysis. Next, it distills key game observations to provide a concise snapshot of the current
situation. Following this, the method translates these summaries into strategic action plans. Finally,
it implements the planned actions within the game, thereby completing the decision cycle. This
process is depicted in Figure 1. This approach, which updates actions every few frames, effectively
manages the fast-paced dynamics of StarCraft II, thereby proving essential for real-time strategic
gameplay. The pseudocode is as shown in Algorithm 1.
6 Experiment
In our experiment, we detail the setup and key metrics (evaluation metrics detailed in Appendix A.2.)
to evaluate macro-strategic decision-making in StarCraft II. We assess the Chain of Summarization’s
impact on LLM gameplay, compare various LLMs’ performance, and evaluate their grasp of Star-
Craft II strategies. Our experiments also concludes with human-AI interaction tests.

6.1 Performance Evaluation of Various LLMs
In this section, we assess the performance of closed-source LLMs [ 21], Llama2 70B [ 22], and
ﬁne-tuned open-source LLMs such as ChatGLM3 6B [ 30] and Qwen 1.8B [ 1] in the TextStarCraft
II environment against the built-in AI at level 5. The experimental results are shown in Table 1,
with the evaluation metrics detailed in Appendix A.2. We tested closed-source LLMs and the un-
ﬁne-tuned Llama2 70B using the standard CoS method. The closed-source models performed well,
while Llama2 70B could not understand the task requirements and was unable to generate commands
based on the given prompts.
Additionally, we ﬁne-tuned open-source models using the entire dataset of GPT3.5-turbo-16k inter-
action logs with TextStarCraft II. Due to computational resource limitations, we removed the CoT
component, keeping only the inputs and outputs. The results showed that all evaluated closed-source
LLMs were capable of defeating the level 5 built-in AI. The ﬁne-tuned open-source models, despite
a loss in strategic diversity, still managed to overcome the level 5 AI, predominantly adopting a
strategy focused on mass-producing stalkers.
Table 2: Performance of models ﬁne-tuned on various datasets in TextStarCraft II, showing win
rates(Vs LV5). Datasets are differentiated based on whether they contain all games or only wins,
and, for subsets of wins, based on the APU performance percentile.

WINSDATASET (25-50% APU) 39/100
WINSDATASET (TOP25% APU, 0-25%) 54/100
Finally, we investigated the impact of data quality using the Average Population Utilization (APU)
metric (detailed in Appendix A.2) to partition the dataset. The results (Table 2) demonstrated that
ﬁne-tuning on wins from the top 25% APU games yielded the highest win rate (54/100), while using
the full dataset resulted in a lower win rate (28/100). This suggests that training data quality, espe-
cially the inclusion of high-performing games, signiﬁcantly impacts ﬁne-tuned model performance
in TextStarCraft II.
6.2 Assessing LLMs’ Mastery of StarCraft II Concepts
We evaluated the understanding of StarCraft II by LLMs like GPT3.5 and GPT-4, focusing on their
knowledge of build orders and game mechanics sourced from prominent StarCraft II forums. De-

spite a reasonable grasp of basic game dynamics, these models faced challenges with more complex
elements like the tech tree and supply constraints.
Evaluation Methodology: To gauge the depth of LLMs’ StarCraft II knowledge, we tested mod-
els, including ChatGPT (GPT3.5), GPT-4, Claude2, and Bard, across ﬁve areas: Basic Knowledge,
Racial Mechanics, Typical Strategies, Standard Build Orders, and Classic Strategies and Counter-
plays (detailed in Appendix G). We used a double-blind evaluation, with both Grandmaster-level
human experts and GPT-4 assessing the responses to ensure unbiased scoring.
Evaluation Results: Both human experts and GPT-4 assessed the LLMs, illustrated in Figures 2and
Table 6, leading to the following insights: In the evaluation of LLMs on a set of complex questions,
GPT-4 and ChatGPT demonstrated the best performance, with GPT-4 receiving high scores from
both itself and human experts. Claude2 had mixed results, with GPT-4 rating it higher than human
experts did. Bard struggled with the complex questions, receiving the lowest scores, especially on
questions 3, 4, and 5. Overall, the LLMs were ranked as follows: GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude2, and
Bard. It is worth noting that GPT-4’s self-assessment showed more variability compared to the more
balanced evaluations provided by human experts.

PLAYER D NEWPLAYER / 10/10
Following insights from Section 6.1, we evaluated the ﬁne-tuned Qwen1.8B model’s real-time inter-
action with human players on home PCs, requiring only 4GB of GPU memory. This model faced
human players of varied skills from the Asian server, including a Grandmaster, a Gold-level player,
and a novice, all playing as Zerg against the Protoss-conﬁgured LLM agent. Results, detailed in Ta-
ble3, show the LLM agent achieving competitive performance, on par with a Gold-level player. This
8highlights the LLM’s adaptability in strategic play and marks a signiﬁcant step towards integrating
AI into competitive gaming environments on accessible home computing setups.
7 Analysis
7.1 Impact of Different Prompts
In evaluating the Chain of Summarization method using the GPT3.5-turbo-16k model in TextStar-
Craft II, we analyzed the effects of two different prompt types on LLM agent performance when
playing as Protoss against Zerg. The results, detailed in Table 4, showed a notable improvement in
performance with more complex prompts.
Table 4: LLM Agent Win Rates (%) vs. TextStarCraft II AI at Varied Difﬁculty Levels.
PROMPT LV1 LV2 LV3 LV4 LV5 LV6
PROMPT 1 87.50 66.67 25.00 12.50 0.00 0.00
PROMPT 2 100.00 100.00 100.00 84.00 50.00 8.33
Simple Thought Chain: Using a basic prompt (see Prompt 1), the LLM agent could perform
elementary operations like worker production, base establishment, and basic combat unit production.
However, this approach was limited in developing advanced strategies, such as research upgrades or
comprehensive game analysis, indicating a narrower strategic depth with simpler prompts.
Complex Thought Chain: A more intricate prompt (see Prompt 2) guided the LLM agent through
a series of critical phases, including situation overview, analysis, strategic planning, and decision-
making. This comprehensive approach enabled the agent to engage in advanced strategies like
research upgrades, tech tree exploration, and complex military maneuvers. It proved particularly
effective against higher difﬁculty levels (e.g., "Harder" lv 5 ), showcasing enhanced strategic capa-
bilities.
Our analysis underscores the importance of complex prompts that replicate the thought processes of
seasoned StarCraft II players. These advanced prompts are essential for LLMs to fully understand
and strategically engage in the sophisticated aspects of the game.
7.2 Policy Interpretability
Our analysis reveals a stark contrast in decision-making between AlphaStar and our LLM agent.
While AlphaStar demonstrates superior micromanagement skills, it occasionally lacks rationality in
its strategic choices. Conversely, the LLM agent consistently exhibits logical decision-making, as
evidenced by its proactive anticipation of threats and strategic planning, detailed in Appendix Eand
Appendix F.

(left) vs. LLM agent (right).
9Anticipating Threats: Figure 3illustrates a stark contrast between AlphaStar and the LLM agent
in their ability to anticipate and respond to potential threats. In Figure 3.a, AlphaStar overlooks the
impending danger posed by enemy Oracles, failing to recognize the need for adequate defensive
structures. This oversight leaves AlphaStar’s base vulnerable to a devastating attack, highlighting
its inability to proactively assess and mitigate potential risks. Conversely, in Figure 3.b, the LLM
agent demonstrates remarkable foresight by analyzing the enemy’s strategy and recommending ap-
propriate defensive measures. The agent’s log data at 05:00 game time reveals its ability to infer the
enemy’s Roach-centric strategy based on the presence of key structures such as the Roach Warren
and Spawning Pool. Armed with this insight, the LLM agent provides a structured decision-making
framework to address the identiﬁed threat:
•Enemy’s Strategy: The enemy has established a Hatchery, Roach Warren, Extractor,
and Spawning Pool. This indicates a potential strategy centered around Roach pro-
duction and early aggression.
•Given the enemy’s potential for early aggression with Roaches, we should prioritize
defensive structures such as Photon Cannons and Shield Batteries. Additionally, con-
sider scouting the enemy base to gather more information about their strategy.
•Decisions:0: <BUILD PHOTONCANNON> 1: <BUILD SHIELDBATTERY>
Flexible Unit Composition: AlphaStar often adheres to ﬁxed unit compositions, leading to inef-
fective strategies in dynamic scenarios (Figure 13.a-d). In contrast, the LLM agent demonstrates
adaptability in unit selection, effectively countering varied enemy tactics (Figure 13.e-h). For in-
stance, in Figure 13.f, the Zerg (Built-in AI) employs a Hydra-Roach composition. The LLM agent,
playing as Protoss in 09:00, recognizes the need to adapt its strategy based on the enemy’s ground-
based army. The agent’s thought process, as shown in the log, reveals its ability to analyze the
situation and make informed decisions:
•Enemy’s Strategy: The enemy seems to be focusing on a ground-based army compo-
sition, consisting of Roaches, Swarm hosts and Hydralisks.
•Key Information: The most important aspect at this moment is our need to expand
our unit composition and technology tree to counter the enemy’s strategy effectively.
We should prioritize unlocking advanced units and upgrades to gain an advantage.
Consider researching psionic storm at the Templar Archives to deal with the enemy’s
ground units effectively.
•Decisions: 4: <RESEARCH PSISTORMTECH>
The LLM agent’s superior performance in threat anticipation and unit composition adaptability
stems from its structured, transparent decision-making process. By analyzing the situation, iden-
tifying key information, and making informed decisions based on the evolving game state, the LLM
agent demonstrates a blend of human knowledge and logical reasoning. This approach enhances the
interpretability of the agent’s gameplay, facilitating better collaboration and strategic adaptation in
complex scenarios, ultimately leading to more successful outcomes compared to AlphaStar’s opaque
strategies.
8 Discussion
TextStarCraft II enhances the use of LLMs for strategic decision-making in StarCraft II, showcasing
their capabilities in adaptive strategy and crisis management. However, the frameworks reliance on
rule-based scripts for micro policies, limitation to non-visual data, and a subset of the game’s races
may restrict the diversity and applicability of AI strategies. Additionally, resource limitations have
constrained the performance capabilities of our system. Despite these challenges, TextStarCraft
II establishes a new benchmark in RTS games, promoting deeper AI-human collaborative research.
Future improvements will focus on integrating visual inputs, expanding race support, and optimizing
resource usage to enhance strategic complexity and performance against established AI models.

13Impact Statements
This work introduces a novel method for addressing real-time strategy (RTS) tasks and strategic
missions using Large Language Models (LLMs), expanding their application beyond traditional
domains. Our approach enhances the interpretability of decisions made by LLMs, offering insights
into the language policies that govern AI behavior in complex scenarios. These advancements have
potential implications for sectors requiring nuanced decision-making and strategic planning, further
bridging the gap between AI capabilities and human-like reasoning in dynamic environments.
Broader Impact
This paper addresses both the positive and negative societal impacts of employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) for real-time strategy gaming environments, such as StarCraft II. On the positive
side, enhancing interpretability through language-driven strategies fosters greater understanding and
transparency in AI decision-making, which can be beneﬁcial across various sectors that require com-
plex strategic thinking. However, the potential negative impacts include the risk that AI-generated
strategies or recommendations might be misleading. This could adversely affect human decision-
making, particularly in scenarios where users rely heavily on AI suggestions without sufﬁcient over-
sight or understanding. Such misleading advice could lead to suboptimal or even harmful decisions
in critical areas like security or management. To mitigate these issues, we advocate for rigorous
validation of AI advice, comprehensive user education on the AI system’s capabilities and limita-
tions, and the development of fail-safes that can alert users to potential inaccuracies or biases in
AI-generated strategies.
Code Of Ethics
This research fully adheres to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. We have ensured that all experiments,
data handling, and dissemination of results maintain high ethical standards and transparency. The
methodologies and technologies used in the study are applied in a controlled environment with no
real-world deployment, mitigating the risk of harm. Additionally, we have preserved the anonymity
of any data used during the training and testing phases to comply with privacy and ethical guidelines.
14A Experiment Setup and Metrics Explanation
A.1 Experiment Setup
Agent and Opponent Selection: To ensure a consistent and controlled experimental environment,
LLM agents are conﬁgured to play as Protoss against Zerg AI opponents. This setup allows for a
systematic evaluation of strategic capabilities across a range of difﬁculties. The difﬁculty levels are
deﬁned as follows to cover a comprehensive spectrum of challenges:
Level 1 2 3 4 5
BLZ Difﬁculty Very Easy Easy Medium Hard Harder
Level 6 7 8 9 10
BLZ Difﬁculty Very Hard Elite Cheat Vision Cheat Money Cheat Insane
Table 5: AI Difﬁculty Levels for StarCraft II
Map Selection: For our experiments, we selected the Altitude LE and Ancient Cistern LE maps
from the 2023 StarCraft II esports 1v1 ladder. These maps provide a variety of strategic challenges
that are representative of current competitive play. Additional details about these maps can be found
on their respective Liquipedia pages: https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Altitude_LE
andhttps://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Ancient_Cistern_LE .
Parameter Settings: The temperature parameter is ﬁxed at 0.1 to focus on strategy-driven actions
over randomness.
Game Version: Our experiments were conducted across three different versions of the game to
ensure robustness and applicability of the results. The versions tested include Patch 5.0.11, Patch
5.0.12, and Patch 5.0.13.
A.2 Evaluation Metrics:
Building on StarCraft II’s established player performance analytics, our evaluation framework in
TextStarCraft II integrates these insights with custom adaptations to comprehensively assess LLM
agents gameplay strategies.
Win Rate: The most crucial metric, Win Rate directly reﬂects the agent’s capability and perfor-
mance within the environment. It is calculated as the percentage of games won by the agent out of
the total games played.
Population Block Ratio (PBR): PBR is a measure of the agents macro-management effectiveness,
particularly in resource allocation and population growth. It is deﬁned as:
PBR =Time at Population Cap
Game Duration(5)
Here, the metric calculates the ratio of time spent at population capacity to the total game time until
the agent ﬁrst reaches maximum supply (200/200). A higher PBR indicates poorer macro-strategic
decision-making and ineffective planning.
Resource Utilization Ratio (RUR): RUR evaluates the agent’s efﬁciency in resource management
throughout the game. It is calculated as:
RUR =Total Minerals + Total Gas Used
Game Duration(6)
This metric assesses the total resources used against the duration of the game until the agent ﬁrst
reaches maximum supply. A higher RUR signiﬁes underutilization of resources, reﬂecting weaker
macro-strategic capabilities.
Average Population Utilization (APU): APU measures the efﬁciency in utilizing the available
population capacity. It is calculated as:
APU =1
NN∑
i=1(Used Population at ithstep
Population Cap at ithstep)
(7)
15The metric averages the ratio of used population to population cap until the agent ﬁrst reaches
maximum supply. A higher APU suggests better utilization of population and more effective macro-
management.
Technology Rate (TR): TR assesses the extent to which the agent explores and utilizes the technol-
ogy tree. It is deﬁned as:
TR=Completed Technologies
Total Technologies Available(8)
This metric calculates the proportion of completed technologies and buildings to the total available,
from the start to the end of the game. TR indicates the agents tendency towards technological
advancement and is not necessarily indicative of better or worse performance.
Data Collection and Analysis: Due to technical constraints with the sc2reader library for AI-
generated replays, we utilized gameplay log data for in-depth analysis. This approach ensures a
thorough and precise evaluation based on our tailored metrics.
A.3 Compute Resource
Training Phase : To ﬁne-tune open-source Large Language Models, we utilized two NVIDIA A100
40GB GPUs, providing the necessary computational power for extensive model training. The entire
experiment took approximately 70 hours.
Testing Phase : The development and testing of these ﬁne-tuned models were performed using two
NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs. For running the StarCraft II environment, we employed an NVIDIA
GeForce RTX 3060 GPU paired with a 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-13400F processor operating
at 2.50 GHz, ensuring smooth execution of the game simulations.
A.4 Human Experts
In the course of our research, we engaged 30 StarCraft II masters and grandmasters, including
professional and semi-professional players, to participate in our experiments. To safeguard their
privacy, we have chosen not to disclose their personal information in this paper.
Each participating player was compensated with 15 USD for their involvement in the study.

Zerg attack.
19C Latency and Real-Time Feedback
The latency in our system is primarily determined by the inference speed and model size of the LLM.
By leveraging ﬁne-tuned open-source LLMs, our approach can achieve real-time feedback. Our
Chain of Summarization (CoS) method is crucial in enabling this real-time feedback, signiﬁcantly
outperforming traditional CoT methods in terms of responsiveness.
For instance, with CoS, even smaller LLMs like the ﬁne-tuned Qwen-2 7B can achieve real-time in-
teraction (100 ms/step) and demonstrate competitive performance against human players. This level
of real-time capability is not possible with standard CoT methods, highlighting the effectiveness of
our CoS approach in facilitating swift strategic decision-making in complex, dynamic environments.
Although larger models such as GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini still face challenges in achieving real-
time feedback (1s/step) due to their size, complexity, and network transmission factors, our CoS
method signiﬁcantly reduces their response times compared to CoT. This improvement allows for
near-real-time performance in many scenarios. We are continuously optimizing our system to further
enhance the real-time capabilities of these larger models.
Below are the delays observed for each step when different LLMs interact with the CoS method:
Model Type Model Name Delay (each step)
Finetuned Open-Source LLM Qwen2-7b 98ms
Finetuned Open-Source LLM Qwen2-1.8b 64ms
Finetuned Open-Source LLM LLAMA2-7B 102ms

1. Game Overview: 
At 15:28 game time, our situation is as follows: We have 49 workers, 2970 minerals, and 4884 gas. Our supply cap is at 131 wi th 33 supply left, and 
our army supply is 41. We have six bases and a decent number of buildings and units.
2. Current Game Stage: 
Based on the game time and resource availability, we are still in the mid -game stage.
3. Our Situation:
3.1 Units and Buildings: We have a diverse unit composition, including V oidrays , and a decent number of buildings, including a Cybernetics Core, 
Twilight Council, and Robotics Facility. We also have a good number of Pylons and gas buildings.
3.2 Economy: Our economy is stable, with a sufficient number of workers and a good balance of minerals and gas.
3.3 Technology: We have started researching Warpgate and Protoss Air Armor Level 1. However, there is room for further technological development 
and research.
4. Our Strategy:
Our strategy seems to be focused on air dominance with V oidrays . We should continue to leverage our air superiority while expanding our technological 
capabilities.
5. Enemy's Strategy:
The enemy seems to be focused on a ground -based army composition, with Roaches, Zerglings, and Hydralisks . They also have some support units 
like Overseers and Infestors . We should be cautious of potential ground attacks and plan our defenses accordingly.
6. Key Information: 
The most important aspect at this moment is our air superiority with V oidrays . However, we need to be prepared for potential ground -based attacks 
from the enemy's Roaches and Hydralisks . Our future success will depend on how we can maintain our air dominance while countering the enemy's 
ground forces.Figure 11: LLM analysis: LLM take Situation Overview, Situation Analysis, Strategic Planning,

G.2 Racial Mechanics in StarCraft II
Q: Discuss the unique mechanisms of the following races: Zerg, protoss and Terran
38GPT3.5: Certainly! Each of the three races in StarCraft II has its own unique mechanics and game-
play style. Here’s an overview of the racial mechanics for the Zerg, Protoss, and Terran factions:
Zerg:
•Creep Spread: Zerg players can spread "creep" across the map. Creep is a slimy substance
that not only provides vision but also enhances the movement speed of Zerg units when
they are on it. Creep is generated by buildings called "Creep Tumors" and the primary Zerg
building, the Hatchery or Lair.
•Larva Mechanic: Zerg units are produced from Larvae, which are spawned by Hatcheries
and Lairs. The number of Larvae determines how quickly a Zerg player can build units.
Managing Larvae effectively is crucial to Zerg gameplay.
•Biological Units: The Zerg rely heavily on biological units and are known for their ability to
quickly swarm opponents with large numbers of units. Their units often have regenerative
abilities and can be upgraded to various forms. Evolution Chambers: Zerg units can be
upgraded at Evolution Chambers, allowing players to adapt their units to counter their
opponent’s strategies.
Protoss:
•Warp-In Mechanic: Protoss units can warp in directly onto the battleﬁeld from Pylons
or Warp Gates, providing a unique mobility advantage. However, this requires strategic
placement of Pylons and Warp Gates.
•Shields: Many Protoss units have energy-based shields in addition to their regular health.
Shields regenerate over time, making hit-and-run tactics effective when used wisely.
•Psionic Abilities: Protoss units often have psionic abilities that can be used for offense or
defense. Examples include Force Fields, which can block enemy units, and Psionic Storm,
which deals area damage.
•Warpgate Research: Protoss players can research the "Warpgate" technology, allowing
them to transform their Gateways into Warp Gates, signiﬁcantly increasing their ﬂexibil-
ity in producing units.
Terran:
•MULEs and SCVs: Terran players can call down MULEs (Mechanized Utility Drones) to
quickly gather resources. SCVs (Space Construction Vehicles) can also repair buildings
and mechanical units.
•Building Mobility: Terran buildings are often mobile, with the ability to lift off and land in
new locations. This ﬂexibility allows for repositioning and strategic play.
•Supply Depots and Wall-offs: Terran players use Supply Depots to provide supply and can
use them to create wall-offs to block enemy movement.
•Terran Infantry: Terran infantry units can be upgraded with a variety of weapons and equip-
ment, making them versatile and adaptable to different situations.
•Siege Tanks: Terran players often employ Siege Tanks, which can transform into siege
mode to deal massive area damage. This unit is a cornerstone of Terran defensive strategies.
Each race in StarCraft II offers a distinct and challenging gameplay experience, and mastering their
unique mechanics is essential for success in the game. Players often choose a race that suits their pre-
ferred playstyle, whether it’s the swarm tactics of the Zerg, the advanced technology of the Protoss,
or the adaptability of the Terran.
GPT4: "StarCraft II" stands out in the RTS genre due to its distinct, asymmetric gameplay, mean-
ing each race has unique mechanisms, units, and strategies that create a deep, strategic environment.
Here’s a detailed look at the speciﬁc racial mechanics for the Zerg, Protoss, and Terran factions:
1. Zerg:
39•Creep: One of the most distinctive aspects of the Zerg is their reliance on Creep, a living
mat of bio-organic substance that spreads from their main structures. Zerg buildings, except
for the Hatchery, must be built on Creep. It also allows Zerg units to move faster when they
are on it, providing both strategic and defensive advantages.
•Larvae and Macro Mechanics: Zergs uniquely produce units through Larvae generated by
their primary structure, the Hatchery (which can be upgraded to a Lair and then a Hive
for more advanced units). These Larvae morph into different units, meaning the Zerg can
adapt their production in real-time as they see ﬁt. The Queen unit can also spawn additional
Larvae to speed up production, emphasizing the Zerg’s swarm-oriented strategy.
•Rapid Expansion: Zerg players often rapidly colonize areas of the map to gain more re-
sources, using inexpensive units to overwhelm opponents. Their ability to quickly spread
Creep helps in establishing new bases and fortifying territories.
2. Protoss:
•Warp Gate Technology: A deﬁnitive feature for the Protoss is their advanced technology,
represented through the transformation of their Gateway buildings into Warp Gates. This
allows the production and immediate deployment of units across the battleﬁeld, provided
there is a power ﬁeld (generated by structures like the Pylon). This ability is crucial for
both reinforcing units during a battle and executing surprise attacks.
•Shields and Health: Protoss units and buildings have two layers of health: a regenerative
shield and their actual health. This characteristic allows Protoss armies to be very resilient,
as shield points regenerate over time when not under attack.
•Chrono Boost: The Protoss Nexus, the main base structure, has an ability called Chrono
Boost that can be used to speed up the production of units, research, and buildings. This
feature is integral to the race’s adaptability, allowing them to respond quickly to threats.
3. Terran:
•Building Mobility: Terran structures, unique amongst the races, have the ability to lift
off and relocate, allowing for strategic repositioning, surprise tactics, and base migration.
This feature is particularly useful for avoiding threats, scouting, and creating forward unit
production points.
•MULEs and Macro Mechanics: Terran Command Centers can call down MULEs (Mining
Unit, Lifting Equipment), temporary units that gather resources at a much higher rate than
SCVs, the standard worker unit. This ability provides a signiﬁcant boost to the Terran
economy over short periods, allowing for bursts of increased production.
•Bunkers and Siege Warfare: The Terrans have a defensive style of play, with structures
like Bunkers and units like the Siege Tank. Bunkers can be garrisoned with infantry units
to improve their survivability and increase the Bunker’s ﬁrepower. Siege Tanks have a
transformation ability, allowing them to switch to a stationary siege mode with increased
range and damage, ideal for both defense and area control.
Each race’s unique mechanics require players to adopt very different strategies for each, contributing
to the game’s dynamic competitive environment. Mastering the utilization of these racial featuresa-
long with understanding those of potential opponentsis crucial for success in "StarCraft II."
Claude2: Here’s an overview of the unique racial mechanics for each of the three StarCraft II
races:
Zerg
•- Larva - Zerg units are produced from larva generated by Hatcheries. This allows the Zerg
player to quickly amass large armies.
•- Creep - Zerg buildings must be built on creep, the purple biological carpet produced by
Hatcheries and Creep Tumors. Units move faster on creep.
•- Inject Larva - Queens can inject larva into Hatcheries to boost unit production. Proper
injecting is essential for Zerg macro.
40•- Morphing - Many Zerg units can morph or evolve into more powerful variants. Examples:
Banelings, Lurkers, Brood Lords.
Protoss
•- Warp-in - Protoss can warp-in units directly onto the battleﬁeld provided they have a Pylon
power source and Gateway/Warp Gate ready. Critical for reinforcements.
•- Chrono Boost - The Nexus’s Chrono Boost ability accelerates building and research times.
Important for protoss economy and tech.
•- Psionics - Many protoss units have psionic abilities like force ﬁelds, hallucination and psi
storms that provide battleﬁeld control.
•- Power Fields - Pylons power protoss buildings and enable warp-in. Destroying Pylons
cuts power and supply for an area.
Terran
•- MULEs - SCVs can build MULEs at Orbital Commands that harvest resources at a faster
rate than SCVs. Boosts income.
•- Salvage - Most Terran structures can be salvaged to recoup some of the resources invested
into them. Provides economic ﬂexibility.
•- Add-ons - Buildings like Barracks and Factories can have Reactor or Tech Lab add-ons to
enhance unit production capabilities.
•- Transforming Units - Many Terran units like Hellions and Vikings can transform between
modes to adapt as needed during battle.
Let me know if you need any clariﬁcation or have additional questions!
Bard: Zerg
The Zerg are a swarm-based race that overwhelms their enemies with sheer numbers. They have
a variety of cheap and expendable units, such as Zerglings and Roaches, as well as more powerful
units such as Hydralisks and Ultralisks. Zerg players are also known for their ability to quickly
expand their bases and produce units.
Here are some of the unique racial mechanics of the Zerg:
•Inject Larva: Zerg Hatcheries produce Larva, which can then be morphed into different
types of units. The Inject Larva ability allows Zerg players to increase the production rate
of their Hatcheries.
•Creep Spread: Zerg Creep is a substance that spreads from Zerg structures and units. Zerg
units gain movement speed and attack speed on Creep. Zerg players can use Creep to
quickly move their armies around the map and to gain an advantage in battles.
•Overlord Speed: Overlords are Zerg ﬂying units that provide vision and can transport units.
Zerg players can upgrade the speed of their Overlords, which allows them to quickly scout
the map and to transport their armies to different locations.
•Zerg Rush: A Zerg Rush is a strategy where Zerg players produce a large number of cheap
and expendable units early in the game and attack their opponent. Zerg Rushes can be very
effective, but they can also be countered by players who are prepared for them.
Protoss
The Protoss are a highly advanced race that relies on powerful technology and psionic abilities. They
have a limited number of units to choose from, but each unit is very powerful. Protoss players are
known for their strong economies and their ability to build powerful armies.
Here are some of the unique racial mechanics of the Protoss:
•Warp Gate: Warp Gates are Protoss structures that allow Protoss players to warp in units
directly from their Nexus. This allows Protoss players to quickly produce units at any
location on the map.
41•Chrono Boost: Chrono Boost is a Protoss ability that can be used to speed up the production
of units or the research of technologies. Protoss players can use Chrono Boost to gain an
advantage in the early game or to quickly produce a powerful army.
•Shields: Protoss units have shields, which are a layer of energy that protects them from
damage. Shields regenerate over time, but they can be depleted by enemy attacks. Protoss
players can use their shields to their advantage by engaging in hit-and-run tactics or by
using their shields to absorb damage while their units attack.
•Psionic Storm: Psionic Storm is a Protoss spell that creates a storm of psionic energy that
damages enemy units in a large area. Protoss players can use Psionic Storm to clear out
enemy armies or to damage enemy structures.
Terran
The Terrans are a versatile race that combines human ingenuity with advanced technology. They
have a wide variety of units to choose from, including Marines, Siege Tanks, and Battlecruisers. Ter-
rans are also known for their powerful mobile structures, such as Command Centers and Factories.
Here are some of the unique racial mechanics of the Terrans:
•MULE: MULEs are Terran worker units that can be called down from Orbital Command
Centers. M.U.L.E.s mine minerals at a faster rate than SCVs, which can help Terran players
to quickly build up their economies.
•Supply Drops: Terran Supply Depots provide supply, which is needed to produce units. Ter-
ran players can also call down Supply Drops from their Command Centers, which provides
additional supply. This allows Terran players to quickly build up their armies.
•Siege Tanks: Siege Tanks are Terran tank units that can transform into a siege mode. In
siege mode, Siege Tanks have a longer range and deal more damage. Terran players can
use Siege Tanks to defend their bases or to attack enemy bases from a distance.
•Medivacs: Medivacs are Terran ﬂying units that can transport units and heal them. Terran
players can use Medivacs to quickly move their armies around the map and to keep their
units alive in battle.
Each race in StarCraft II has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. Zerg players are known for
their ability to quickly produce large armies, Protoss players are known for their strong economies
and powerful units, and Terran players are known for their versatility and mobile structures.The best
way to learn about the unique racial mechanics of each race is to experiment with them and to play
against other players.
G.3 Typical Strategies in StarCraft II for Different Matchups
Q1: TvZ: What’s a common strategy for Terran vs. Zerg?
GPT3.5: Terran vs. Zerg (TvZ):
•Bio-Mech Composition: Terran often uses a combination of infantry (Marines, Marauders)
and mechanical units (Siege Tanks, Hellbats) against Zerg. This composition allows for
mobility and ﬁrepower.
•Harassment: Terran players often employ drop tactics, using Medivacs to drop units into
Zerg bases to disrupt their economy and force them to split their forces.
•Widow Mines: Widow Mines can be used to deter Zergling and Baneling attacks, and they
can also be dropped into Zerg mineral lines to deal economic damage.
GPT4: A common strategy involves harassment to prevent the Zerg from comfortably expanding
and massing their forces. Terrans might use Hellions to attack Zerg’s worker units or dropships to
move units behind enemy lines. The overall aim is to control the pace, forcing Zerg to react to Terran
threats while building a strong economy and army for a decisive push.
42Claude2: Terran often opens with a Reaper expand into Hellions for map control and harassment.
This transitions to Marine/Medivac for mobility and bio strength. Tanks added for splash against
Zerglings.
Bard: A common strategy for Terran vs. Zerg is to go for a macro build, such as Bio (Marines,
Medivacs, and other support units) or Mech (Siege Tanks, Hellions, and other mechanical units).
Terran players can also try to rush their Zerg opponent with early aggression, such as a Reaper Rush
or a Marine/Marauder Rush.
Q2: TvT: What’s a typical strategy in Terran vs. Terran matchups?
GPT3.5:
•Tank Warfare: TvT often involves tank battles. Players set up Siege Tanks defensively and
try to gain positional advantages while avoiding being caught unsieged.
•Viking Control: Air control is crucial in TvT. Vikings are used to gain air superiority and
vision for Siege Tanks. Raven usage for interference matrix can also be a key factor.
•Bio vs. Mech: Terran players can choose between a bio-heavy composition (Marines,
Marauders) and a mech-heavy composition (Siege Tanks, Hellions). The choice can depend
on personal preference and map.
GPT4: TvT often revolves around positioning and tank warfare. Siege Tanks are critical for area
control, and players jockey for position and map control. Air superiority via Vikings is also crucial
to provide vision and control. Since all units are available to both sides, scouting, deception, and
adaptability are key.
Claude2: Both players open Reaper expand for scouting information. Focus is on securing ad-
ditional bases for economy. Tanks, Vikings and air control are critical for positioning and engage-
ments.
Bard: A typical strategy in Terran vs. Terran matchups is to go for a macro build, such as Bio or
Mech. Terran players can also try to scout their opponent’s build early and counter it with a speciﬁc
composition. For example, if a Terran player sees that their opponent is going for Bio, they can
counter with Siege Tanks and Hellions.
Q3: TvP: How do Terran players generally approach a Protoss opponent?
GPT3.5:
•Bio Play: Terran often employs bio compositions (Marines, Marauders, Medivacs) against
Protoss. Micro-intensive battles and mobility are key.
•Ghost Usage: Ghosts can snipe high-value Protoss units like Templars and Observers. They
also have EMP to drain Protoss shields and energy.
•Liberator Zones: Liberators can establish zones of control and disrupt Protoss positioning
with their anti-ground mode.
GPT4: Terrans often use a mixture of bio units (Marines and Marauders) supplemented with Medi-
vacs for healing and mobility against Protoss. Harassment with drops to disrupt the Protoss economy
and tech is common. Terrans need to be aggressive, as a fully teched and maxed Protoss army can
be difﬁcult to defeat head-on.
Claude2: Terran applies early pressure with units like Reapers, Hellions and Widow Mines. Goal
is to slow Protoss economy and tech while expanding themselves. Marines and Ghosts counter
late-game Protoss power units.
Bard: Terran players generally approach a Protoss opponent by trying to expand their economy
and build up a strong army. Terran players can also try to rush their Protoss opponent with early
aggression, such as a Reaper Rush or a Hellion Rush.
43Q4: ZvZ: What’s a standard strategy in Zerg vs. Zerg battles?
GPT3.5:
•Zergling-Baneling Wars: ZvZ is known for Zerglings and Banelings clashing. Players aim
to control these units efﬁciently and gain map control.
•Roach Timing Attacks: Roach-based strategies can be effective for pushing across the map
and pressuring the opponent.
•Mutalisk Play: Mutalisks are used for harassment and map control in the mid-to-late game.
GPT4: ZvZ can be very volatile and is often characterized by early aggressive plays, like Zergling
and Baneling skirmishes. Map control via scouting with Overlords is crucial to see incoming threats.
Due to the mirror nature, small advantages can escalate quickly, and tech switches to counter the
opponent’s unit composition are common.
Claude2: Quickly droning up to 3 bases while producing defensive units like Queens. Tech to
either Roaches for safety or Mutalisks for harassment. Late-game transition to Brood Lords.
Bard: A standard strategy in Zerg vs. Zerg battles is to go for a macro build, such as Mu-
talisk/Zergling or Roach/Hydra. Zerg players can also try to rush their opponent with early ag-
gression, such as a Zergling Rush or a Baneling Rush.
Q5: ZvP: What are Zerg strategies when facing Protoss?
GPT3.5:
•Hydralisk and Lurker Play: Hydralisks and Lurkers are often used against Protoss, as they
can deal with Gateway units effectively.
•Creep Spread: Zerg players work to spread creep to control the map and gain vision, which
is crucial in ZvP.
•Tech Switches: Zerg may transition between unit compositions, such as Roach-Ravager
into Brood Lords or Ultralisks, to keep Protoss players guessing.
GPT4: Zerg players aim to out-expand their Protoss rivals early on, using units like Zerglings and
Roaches to defend against early aggression. They must be wary of Protoss area-of-effect (AoE)
damage from units like High Templars and Colossi, often opting for tech like Corruptors or Vipers
to neutralize key threats, and tech switches to keep Protoss guessing.
Claude2: Defend early Protoss pressures like Adepts while droning up. Roach/Ravager with In-
festors to counter Immortals, or Hydra/Lurker for anti-air. Vipers critical for late-game.
Bard: Zerg strategies when facing Protoss typically involve trying to overwhelm their opponent
with a large army of cheap and expendable units, such as Zerglings and Banelings. Zerg players can
also try to ﬂank their Protoss opponent with Mutalisks or to use their Hydralisks to pick off Protoss
units from a distance.
Q6: ZvT: How do Zerg players counter Terran tactics?
GPT3.5:
•Baneling-Mutalisk: Zerg players often use Banelings and Mutalisks for harassment and
map control. Banelings can be used to deal with Terran infantry.
•Infestors: Infestors can be used to fungal growth Terran bio units and neural parasite pow-
erful Terran units like Siege Tanks or Thors.
•Brood Lords and Ultralisks: Late-game ZvT often involves transitioning into Brood Lords
and Ultralisks for power and durability.
44GPT4: Zerg often faces bio-ball compositions (Marines, Marauders, Medivacs) or mechanical
units (like Tanks and Thors). Zerg needs to expand quickly, defend against harassment, and may use
Banelings, Zerglings, and Hydralisks for defense transitioning to more robust units like Ultralisks
or Brood Lords depending on Terran composition.
Claude2: Ling/Bane for Bio defense. Fast spire into Mutalisk harass. Transition to Ultralisks
supported by Queens and Infestors for the often mech-heavy Terran end-game.
Bard: Zerg players counter Terran tactics by using their superior mobility and economy to their
advantage. Zerg players can also use their powerful units, such as Ultralisks and Brood Lords, to
defeat Terran armies
Q7: PvZ: How should Protoss approach a Zerg opponent?
GPT3.5:
•Gateway Expand: Protoss players often open with a Gateway expansion, using units like
Adepts and Stalkers to control the early game.
•Tech Choices: Protoss can opt for Stargate play (Phoenixes or Oracles) for harassment, or
they may go for a Robo facility for Immortals or Disruptors.
•High Templars: Templars are used for their Psionic Storm ability to deal with large Zerg
armies.
GPT4: Protoss players must secure a solid economic base while defending against Zerg’s potential
for rushes and harassment. Walling off chokepoints with buildings and using units like Zealots and
Sentries to defend is common early game. They rely on powerful AoE units (like Colossi and High
Templars) later in the game, often leveraging tech advantages for strong pushes.
Claude2: Fast expand into Immortal/Archon/Chargelot to defend Zerg attacks. High Templar for
storms against Hydras. Skytoss deathball critical for late game.
Bard: Protoss players approach a Zerg opponent by trying to expand their economy and build up
a strong army of powerful units, such as Zealots, Stalkers, and Immortals. Protoss players can also
use their Colossi to deal damage to Zerg units from a distance.
Q8: PvP: What’s the strategy for Protoss vs. Protoss games?
GPT3.5:
•Stalker-Sentry: Early PvP often features Stalkers and Sentries for map control and defense.
•Disruptor Play: Disruptors are a key unit in PvP, used for their ability to deal massive area
damage to enemy units.
•Blink Stalker Micro: Micro-management of Blink Stalkers can be a deciding factor in PvP
engagements.
GPT4: Early game revolves around preventing enemy harassment and scouting to anticipate tech
choices. The mid-game often sees a lot of positioning battles and potential for blink Stalker ha-
rassment. Since Protoss units are powerful but costly, efﬁcient trades and protecting key units are
paramount, with late-game often seeing advanced units like Carriers or Tempests.
Claude2: Robo for Immortals or fast expand with Blink Stalkers. Disruptors and High Templar
for splash against massed Gateway units. Whoever gets Tempests wins the late game.
Bard: The strategy for Protoss vs. Protoss games typically involves trying to scout their oppo-
nent’s build early and counter it with a speciﬁc composition. For example, if a Protoss player sees
that their opponent is going for a Colossi build, they can counter with Immortals and Void Rays.
45Q9: PvT: How do Protoss players generally strategize against Terran?
GPT3.5:
•Adept Openings: Protoss may open with Adepts for early map control and harassment.
•Colossi and/or Storm: Colossi are strong against Terran bio, while High Templars with
Storm can deal with clumped bio forces.
•Disruptors: Disruptors can be used to disrupt Terran positioning and force engagements.
GPT4: Protoss strategies often involve careful defense against early Terran aggression, using units
like Stalkers and Sentries, while advancing tech. Harassment with units like Oracles or Phoenixes
can keep Terran unbalanced. In the later game, Protoss looks to leverage high-tech units (like
Colossi, High Templars, or Carriers) to break through Terran’s defenses.
Claude2: openings to secure expand. Robo for Observer scouting and Immortals against Terran
vehicles. Storms and Archons counter Marine/Marauder bio play.
Bard: Protoss players generally strategize against Terran by trying to expand their economy and
build up a strong army of powerful units, such as Zealots, Stalkers, and Immortals. Protoss players
can also use their Colossi to deal damage to Terran units from a distance.

These build orders provide a foundation for each race, but remember that ﬂexibility and adaptation
are key in StarCraft II. Adjust your build order based on scouting information and your opponent’s
actions to maximize your chances of success.
GPT4: Certainly, "StarCraft II" revolves heavily around build orders, which are pre-determined
sets of actions aimed at maximizing efﬁciency, economy, and production. These build orders set the
stage for your mid-game and late-game strategies. Below are standard build orders for each race,
which are foundational and can be adapted based on opponents’ actions. Remember, the numbers
represent the total worker count you should have when you begin each step.
Terran (Standard Opening):
•14/15: Supply Depot
•16/23: Barracks
•16/23: Reﬁnery
•19/23: Orbital Command (immediately after Barracks completion)
•20/23: Reaper (for scouting and slight harassment)
•21/23: Command Center (on the low ground if you’re feeling safe)
•21/23: Factory (after Reaper starts)
•23/31: Supply Depot
47•Follow-up: Depends on scouting information (could include more Barracks, a Starport, or
additional expansions and tech buildings).

•23/31: Adept or Stalker (after Cybernetics Core ﬁnishes for defense/scouting)
•Follow-up: Varied based on scouting but might include additional Gateways, a Robotics
Facility, or a Stargate, and tech advancements like Warp Gate research.
These build orders are basic openings designed for beginners to intermediates and are meant to
establish your economy while keeping you safe in the early game. They are not rigid play patterns.
"StarCraft II" is a dynamic game, and all strategies need to adapt to opponent actions. Effective
scouting and understanding of your opponent’s strategy are crucial, and as you gain more experience,
you’ll begin to learn how to alter your build order in response to what you’re seeing on the battleﬁeld.
Claude2: Here are some standard opening build orders for each race in StarCraft II:
Terran Build Order:
•14 Supply Depot
•16 Barracks
•16 Reﬁnery
•@100% Barracks - Reaper and Orbital Command
•22 2nd Command Center
•@400 minerals - 2nd Barracks
This gets an early Reaper for scouting and harassment, while using the Orbital Command for extra
economy and ﬂexibility. The 2nd CC and Barracks enable a solid 2-base infrastructure.
Zerg Build Order:
•17 Spawning Pool
•17 Extractor
48•17 Hatchery
•@100% Spawning Pool - 2 Queens
•21 3rd Hatchery
•@100 gas - Metabolic Boost (Zergling speed)
•@100% 3rd Hatch - 2 more Queens
This provides a quick Queen defense, fast Zergling speed, and lots of Larva for droning with the fast

G.5 Classic Strategies and Counterplays in StarCraft II
Q1: PvZ: What are effective strategies and counterplays against a roach-hydra attack?
51GPT3.5: PvZ: Against Roach-Hydra Attack:
Strategy for Protoss:
•Force Fields: Use Sentries to create Force Fields to segment the Roach-Hydra army, pre-
venting it from engaging as a whole.
•Colossi: Colossus units deal area damage and are effective against clumps of Roaches and
Hydralisks.
•Immortals: Immortals are strong against Roaches due to their bonus damage against ar-
mored units.
•Archons: Archons have splash damage and can help clear out Hydralisks.
Counterplay for Zerg:
•Tech to Hive: Transition to Hive tech for units like Vipers, which can abduct key enemy
units or use Blinding Cloud to reduce the effectiveness of enemy ranged units.
•Hydra Speed Upgrade: Research Muscular Augments for Hydralisks to improve their mo-
bility.
•Burrow: Use Burrow for Roaches to save them from being picked off and to regain health.
•Drop Play: Drop Roaches or Hydralisks into the Protoss main base for harassment to divert
their attention. Creep Spread: Maintain good Creep spread to ensure mobility and vision.
GPT4: When Protoss players face a Zerg opponent focusing on Roach-Hydra, they’re dealing
with a versatile force that can be potent in a head-on ﬁght due to its range, damage, and health,
particularly in the mid-game.
•Strategic Positioning: Force engagements in narrow passages where the Zerg cannot lever-
age their numbers. Simultaneously, avoid open areas where the Zerg army can fully sur-
round your forces.
•High Templars: These units are crucial. Their Psionic Storm ability deals massive dam-
age to biological units, which makes them particularly effective against Hydralisks and
clumped-up Roaches.
•Colossi: With their extended thermal lance upgrade, they can exploit their superior range
and area-of-effect damage to decimate tightly packed Roach-Hydra armies.
•Sentries: Force Fields can cut off portions of the Zerg army, preventing them from engaging
all at once, or Guardian Shield can reduce incoming ranged damage.
•Harassment: Divide the Zerg’s attention. Warp Prisms, Zealot run-bys, and Dark Templars
can force the Zerg player to split their army, making it less effective in a direct engagement.
Claude2: Against Roach-Hydra, go Immortal/Archon with chargelots. Immortals counter
Roaches, Archons counter Hydras. Focus ﬁre with Immortals.alternatively, fast tech to Colossus.
Use Sentries for forceﬁelds to split Zerg army. Expand behind and get High Templar for storms.
Bard: Effective Strategies:
•Go for a Colossus build. Colossi are very effective against Roaches and Hydras, and they
can also deal damage to Zerg structures.
•Use Void Rays to pick off Roaches and Hydras from a distance. Void Rays are also very
effective against Zerg Overlords, which can help you to deny your opponent vision and to
make it more difﬁcult for them to attack you.
•Use Warp Gates to quickly produce units and to respond to Zerg attacks. Warp Gates allow
you to warp in units directly from your Nexus, which can help you to quickly build up your
army and to defend your base. Effective Counterplays:
•Use Observers to scout your opponent’s base and to see what kind of army they are building.
This will give you time to prepare for their attack and to build the appropriate counter-units.
52•Use Pylons to power your units and to build Shielding Batteries. This will help to protect
your units from Zerg attacks.
•Use Force Fields to block off Zerg units and to create chokepoints. This will make it more
difﬁcult for your opponent to attack your base.
Q2: TvZ: How should Terran approach a mutalisk-zergling-baneling composition? Are there
gambits or counter-strategies to consider?
GPT3.5: TvZ: Against Mutalisk-Zergling-Baneling Composition:
Strategy for Terran:
•Thors: Thors are strong anti-air units that can target Mutalisks effectively.
•Widow Mines: Widow Mines can deal signiﬁcant damage to clumps of Mutalisks if prop-
erly positioned.
•Marine Splitting: Split your Marines to minimize the impact of Baneling detonations.
•Missile Turrets: Build Missile Turrets in key locations to protect against Mutalisk harass-
ment.
•Vikings and Liberators: Vikings can help control the air, and Liberators can provide anti-
ground support.
Counterplay for Zerg:
•Baneling Drops: Use Overlords to drop Banelings onto clumps of Marines.
•Transition to Ultralisks: Ultralisks are powerful melee units that can be effective against
Terran infantry.
•Corruptors: Corruptors can be used to target Thors and Vikings and reduce the anti-air
capabilities of the Terran.
•Infestors: Fungal Growth can be used to lock down Marines and other units.
•Creep Spread: Maintain Creep spread to gain map control and mobility.
GPT4: The Muta-Ling-Bane composition is a highly mobile harassment force that seeks to control
the map, prevent expansions, and pick off stray units. Dealing with it requires a mix of solid defense
and map awareness.
•Marine-Medivac-Widow Mine: Marines, with their high DPS, are effective against Zer-
glings and Mutalisks, especially when combined with Medivacs for healing. Widow Mines
add a layer of defense against Banelings and can devastate clumped Mutalisks.
•Thors and Liberators: Thors can help deter Mutalisks with their strong anti-air attack, es-
pecially in High Impact Payload mode. Liberators can zone out Mutalisks and provide
support against ground units.
•Base Defense: Well-placed Missile Turrets and Bunkers can help defend against harass-
ment. Building walls at choke points prevent Zergling run-bys.
•Map Control: Establish map control with Marine or Hellion squads and maintain good
vision to see enemy movements. This approach helps in preparing for incoming attacks
and catching the Zerg army out of position.
Claude2: Marines, Thors and Widow Mines counter Mutalisks. Thors splash damage and Widow
Mine hits punish clumped Mutalisks. Turrets at mineral lines prevent economic harassment. Bio-
mine with Medivacs can pick apart Zerglings. Siege Tanks zone out Banelings.
Bard: Effective Strategies:
•Go for a Bio build. Bio units are very effective against Mutalisks and Zerglings, and they
can also deal damage to Zerg structures.
53•Use Siege Tanks to deal damage to Mutalisks and Zerglings from a distance. Siege Tanks
are also very effective against Zerg Overlords, which can help you to deny your opponent
vision and to make it more difﬁcult for them to attack you.
•Use Medivacs to heal your units and to transport them around the map. Medivacs can also
be used to drop your units into the middle of a Zerg army, which can be a very effective
way to engage your opponent. Effective Counterplays:
•Use Missile Turrets and Bunkers to defend your base from Mutalisk attacks. Missile Turrets
and Bunkers are both very effective against Mutalisks, and they can also be used to defend
your workers and your structures.
•Use Ravens to detect Mutalisks and to cast Interference Matrix on them. This will make it
more difﬁcult for your opponent to control their Mutalisks and to attack you.
•Use Vikings to shoot down Mutalisks. Vikings are the only Terran unit that can attack air
units without moving, which makes them very effective against Mutalisks.
Q3: TvP: When faced with an archon-zealot push, what are the best strategies and counters
for Terran?
GPT3.5: TvP: Against Archon-Zealot Push:
Strategy for Terran:
•Kite and Focus Fire: Kite the Zealots with your ranged units (e.g., Marines and Marauders)
and focus ﬁre on Archons.
•Medivac Micro: Use Medivacs to pick up and reposition units to avoid the melee engage-
ments.
•Widow Mines: Position Widow Mines to hit the Zealots and soften the Archons.
•Ghosts: EMP from Ghosts can drain the shields of Protoss units, including Archons.
Counterplay for Protoss:
•Force Fields: Create Force Fields to segment the Terran army and prevent kiting.
•Immortals: Immortals are strong against Archons due to their bonus damage against ar-
mored units.
•High Templars: Use Psi Storm to deal AoE damage to the Terran infantry.
•Air Units: Consider incorporating air units like Void Rays or Phoenixes for added versatil-
ity.
•Guardian Shield: Use the Guardian Shield ability from Sentries to reduce incoming ranged
damage.
Remember that these strategies and counterplays are not exhaustive, and adaptability is key in Star-
Craft II. The speciﬁc outcome of battles can depend on micro-management, unit composition, up-
grades, and positioning, so always be prepared to adjust your tactics based on the evolving situation
in the game.
GPT4: Archon-Zealot (often with some Immortals) is a powerful, close-quarters Protoss army
composition that relies on brute force and strong front-line units.
•Ghost Usage: Ghosts’ EMP Round is highly effective in draining the shields of Archons,
Zealots, and Immortals, signiﬁcantly weakening their upfront staying power in battles.
•Liberators and Siege Tanks: The use of Liberators with Defender Mode and Siege Tanks
can create a zone of control that Zealots and Archons cannot approach easily. Kiting into
these zones can decimate a Protoss army that’s chasing.
•Micro-intensive Kiting: Using bio forces (Marines and Marauders) supplemented with
Medivacs for healing, a player can continuously kite against Zealots and Archons, which
lack ranged attacks.
54•Sim City: Terrans can build in a way that chokes off paths (using Supply Depots, Bunkers,
etc.), restricting the mobility and attack angles of melee units like Zealots and forcing
Archons to funnel through tight spaces where they can’t leverage their splash damage.
Each of these scenarios emphasizes not just the composition of your forces but also the importance
of control, positioning, adaptability, and game sense. "StarCraft II" is a game of constant decision-
making, and successful players must be able to read their opponents and adjust their strategies on
the ﬂy.
Claude2: Marines and Marauders counter Zealots, while Ghosts and Liberators counter Archons.
Kite with bio and emp Archons. Siege Tanks in tank mode punish Zealot chargelots. Well-spread
mines damage clumped Zealots. Scan aggressively to preemptively snipe Observers and enable
Widow Mines.
Bard: Effective Strategies:
•Go for a Bio build. Bio units are very effective against Zealots and Archons, and they can
also deal damage to Protoss structures.
•Use Siege Tanks to deal damage to Zealots and Archons from a distance. Siege Tanks are
also very effective against Protoss Colossus, which can help you to defend your base and
to make it more difﬁcult for your opponent to attack you.
•Use Medivacs to heal your units and to transport them around the map. Medivacs can also
be used to drop your units into the middle of a Protoss army, which can be a very effective
way to engage your opponent.
Effective Counterplays:
•Use Missile Turrets and Bunkers to defend your base from Archon and Zealot attacks.
Missile Turrets and Bunkers are both very effective against Zealots and Archons, and they
can also be used to defend your workers and your structures.
•Use Scans to detect Protoss units and to see what kind of army they are building. This will
give you time to prepare for their attack and to build the appropriate counter-units.
•Use Snipers to pick off Protoss units from a distance. Snipers are very effective against
Zealots and Archons, and they can also be used to deal damage to Protoss Colossus.
