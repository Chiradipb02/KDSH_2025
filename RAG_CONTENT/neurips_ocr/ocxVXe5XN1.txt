Abstract
In this work, we introduce novel information-theoretic generalization bounds
using the conditional f-information framework, an extension of the traditional
conditional mutual information (MI) framework. We provide a generic approach
to derive generalization bounds via f-information in the supersample setting,
applicable to both bounded and unbounded loss functions. Unlike previous MI-
based bounds, our proof strategy does not rely on upper bounding the cumulant-
generating function (CGF) in the variational formula of MI. Instead, we set the CGF
or its upper bound to zero by carefully selecting the measurable function invoked
in the variational formula. Although some of our techniques are partially inspired
by recent advances in the coin-betting framework (e.g., Jang et al. (2023)), our
results are independent of any previous findings from regret guarantees of online
gambling algorithms. Additionally, our newly derived MI-based bound recovers
many previous results and improves our understanding of their potential limitations.
Finally, we empirically compare various f-information measures for generalization,
demonstrating the improvement of our new bounds over the previous bounds.
1 Introduction
Understanding generalization is a longstanding topic of machine learning research. Recently,
information-theoretic generalization measures, e.g., mutual information (MI) between the input
(i.e. data) and output (i.e. hypothesis) of a learning algorithm, have been proposed by [ 2–4]. While
original MI-based information-theoretic generalization bounds have made significant progress in
analyzing the generalization of stochastic gradient-based algorithms in nonconvex learning problems
(e.g., deep learning) [ 5–13], they are found to have several limitations. One of the most severe
limitations is their unboundedness, where the MI measure can be infinite while the true generalization
error is small [ 14]. To mitigate this issue, various bound-tightening techniques have been proposed
[15,6,7]. Among them, [ 16] introduces a conditional mutual information (CMI) framework, which
allows for the derivation of a CMI-based bound that is strictly upper-bounded by a constant. In the
CMI framework, an additional “ghost sample” is introduced alongside the original sample drawn from
the unknown data distribution. A Bernoulli random variable sequence is then used to determine the
membership of training data from these two samples. Ultimately, the CMI between these Bernoulli
random variables and the output hypothesis of the learning algorithm, conditioned on these two
samples, characterizes generalization. This setup, known as the “supersample” setting, ensures the
38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).boundedness of the CMI bound due to the constant entropy of a Bernoulli random variable. Intuitively,
this CMI quantity leaks less information between data and the hypothesis, resulting in tighter bounds
compared to the original MI quantity, as theoretically justified in [ 17]. Furthermore, several studies
have aimed to further tighten CMI-based bounds. For example, previous tightening techniques in
[15,6,7] are also applicable to CMI bounds [ 17–21]. Notably, another way to tighten the CMI
bound is by utilizing variants of the original CMI quantity, such as functional CMI ( f-CMI) [ 22],
evaluated CMI (e-CMI) [ 16,23], and loss-difference CMI (ld-CMI) [ 24]. As the output hypothesis is
replaced by the predictions, loss pairs, and loss differences of the two samples, these CMI quantities
are tighter than the original hypothesis-based CMI due to the data-processing inequality. While most
information-theoretic bounds in the supersample setting focus on (conditional) mutual information
measures, it is natural to ask whether there is a general way to extend this CMI framework to other
statistical distance/divergence measures, such as other f-divergences.
Using alternative dependence measures to replace MI in information-theoretic generalization bounds
has been studied in several existing works [ 25–30], with some of them considering the supersample
setting. In particular, [ 26] provides some Wasserstein distance-based and total variation-based bounds
in the supersample setting. Furthermore, [ 29] proposes a general convex analysis-based framework
that replaces the input-output MI quantity in [ 2–4] with any strongly convex function. While [ 29]
itself does not discuss the supersample setting, the further extension in [ 30] indeed considers invoking
the supersample setting to strengthen the bounds.
In this work, we present a generic approach to derive generalization bounds based on conditional
f-information, a natural extension from mutual information to other f-dvergence-based dependence
measures. Our proof strategy is significantly different from the original CMI framework [ 16] and
the convex analysis (or regret analysis) based framework [ 29,30]. Specifically, our development
starts from the variational representation of f-divergence, which involves the convex conjugate of
a convex function used to define the f-divergence. While the previous CMI framework focuses on
upper-bounding the cumulant generating function (CGF) of a selected measurable function (which
relates to the generalization error), we make a particular choice of such a measurable function, namely
the inverse of that convex conjugate function. This choice makes CGF equal to (or upper bounded
by) zero, hence eliminated from the variational representation. The remaining task is to lower bound
this inverse of the convex conjugate function under a joint distribution. In the case of MI (or KL),
the expectation of this inverse function is close to the log wealth quantity used in the coin-betting
framework for obtaining concentration inequalities [ 31,1,32]. Indeed, the lower bounding techniques
here are inspired by some inequalities used in the coin-betting framework [ 31,1,32], and we extend
them to the cases of other f-divergence in the supersample setting. Notably, unlike [ 30,1], our
conditional f-information generalization bounds do not rely on any existing regret guarantees of
online learning algorithms. We discuss the connection with the coin-betting framework in Appendix E.
Given that f-divergences all obey the data-processing inequality [ 33], we focus on using loss
difference (ld)-based f-information, an extension of ld-CMI in [ 24], in this work. Specifically, our
main contributions are summarized as follows: 1) In the case where the loss difference between a
data pair is bounded, we first provide a novel variational formula (cf. Lemma 3.1) for f-information,
enabling us to derive conditional f-information-based generalization bounds; 2) For the KL case,
we first provide an “oracle” CMI bound (cf. Theorem 3.1). This bound recovers many previous
CMI bounds, including the square-root bound and fast-rate bounds in low empirical risk settings. It
also helps us understand the potential looseness of previous square-root CMI bounds, where some
quantities that can vanish as the sample size nincreases are simply ignored. Additionally, some novel
fast-rate bounds are implied (cf. Corollary 3.1-3.2). Particularly, Corollary 3.2 contains a term in
the form of the product of total variation and KL divergence, a similar quantity also appearing in a
recent PAC-Bayesian bound [ 34]; 3) We present several other f-information-based bounds, including
the looser measure, χ2-information (cf. Theorem B.2) and tighter measures, squared Hellinger (SH)-
information (cf. Theorem 3.2) and Jensen-Shannon (JS)-information (cf. Theorem 3.3). Due to the
similarity in expressions, most arguments for our CMI bounds are also applicable to these bounds
based on f-information measures; 4) We extend our framework to the unbounded loss difference
case, where we provide a refined variational formula for f-information (cf. Lemma 4.1), enabling us
to provide a novel f-information-based bound (cf. Theorem 4.1 for the case of KL). The obtained
bound is no worse than a previous information-theoretic generalization bound in [ 25] (adapted to
the same supersample setting); 5) Empirical results show that the new bounds in our framework,
particularly the squared Hellinger-information bound, outperform previous results.
22 Preliminaries
Notation Throughout this paper, we adopt a convention where capitalized letters denote random
variables, and their corresponding lowercase letters represent specific realizations. Let PXdenote
the distribution of a random variable X, and PX|Yrepresent the conditional distribution of Xgiven
Y. When conditioning on a specific realization, we use PX|Y=yor simply PX|y. Additionally, we
useEXandEPinterchangeably to denote the expectation over X∼P, whenever it is clear from
context. Moreover, EX|Y=y(orEX|y) denotes the expectation over X∼PX|Y=y.
Generalization Error LetZbe the domain of the instances, and let Wbe the domain of the
hypotheses. We denote the unknown distribution of the instances by µ, and let S={Zi}n
i=1i.i.d∼µ
be the training sample. A learning algorithm A, characterized by a conditional distribution PW|S,
takes the training sample Sas the input and outputs a hypothesis W∈ W , i.e.A:Zn→ W . To
evaluate the quality of the output hypothesis W, we use a loss function ℓ:W × Z → R+
0. For
any hypothesis w, the population risk is defined as Lµ(w)≜EZ′[ℓ(w, Z′)], where Z′∼µis an
independent testing instance. In practice, since µis unknown, we use the empirical risk, which
is defined as LS(w)≜1
nPn
i=1ℓ(w, Z i), as a proxy for the population risk of w. The expected
generalization error is then defined as Eµ(A)≜EW[Lµ(W)]−EW,S[LS(W)].
Supersample Setting We follow the traditional supersample setting introduced by [ 16]. Let an n×2
matrix eZ∈ Zn×2be the supersample, where each entry is drawn i.i.d. from the data distribution µ.
We index the columns of eZby{0,1}, and denote the ith row of eZaseZiwith entries (eZi,0,eZi,1). We
useU={Ui}n
i=1∼Unif({0,1}n), independent of eZ, to determine the training sample membership
fromeZ. Specifically, when Ui= 0,eZi,0ineZis included in the training set S, andeZi,1is used
for testing; Ui= 1 dictates the opposite case. Let Ui= 1−Ui, the training sample Sis then
equivalent to eZU={eZi,Ui}n
i=1, and the testing sample is eZU={eZi,Ui}n
i=1. Additionally, we let
Li,0≜ℓ(W,eZi,0)and define Li,1similarly. Let ∆Li=Li,1−Li,0be the loss difference in the ith
row ofeZ. To avoid complicated subscripts, we also use superscripts +and−to replace the subscripts
0and1, respectively, namely, eZ+
i=eZi,0,eZ−
i=eZi,1,L+
i=Li,0andL−
i=Li,1. Furthermore,
we define Gi≜(−1)Ui∆Li, i.e. the testing loss minus the training loss at position i. Clearly,
1
nPn
i=1Giis an unbiased estimator of Eµ(A). In other words, Eµ(A) =1
nPn
i=1E∆Li,Ui[Gi].
f-Divergence and f-Information The family of f-divergence is defined as follows.
Definition 2.1 (f-divergence [ 33]).LetPandQbe two distributions on Θ, and let ϕ:R+→Rbe
a convex function with ϕ(1) = 0 . IfP≪Q, then the f-divergence between PandQis defined as
Dϕ(P||Q)≜EQ
ϕdP
dQ
,
wheredP
dQis a Radon-Nikodym derivative.
A variational representation for f-divergence, as provided below, has been independently investigated
in previous works [ 35,25,36,37,33]. Recently, this variational representation has also been applied
to PAC-Bayesian generalization theory [38] and domain adaptation theory [39, 40].
Lemma 2.1 ([37, Corollary 3.5]) .Letϕ∗be the convex conjugate1ofϕ, andG={g: Θ→
dom( ϕ∗)}. The following, known as variational formula of f-divergence, holds:
Dϕ(P||Q) = sup
g∈GEθ∼P[g(θ)]−inf
λ∈R{Eθ∼Q[ϕ∗(g(θ) +λ)]−λ}.
Following [ 33, Section 7.8], let Iϕ(X;Y)≜Dϕ(PX,Y||PXPY)be the f-information, which extends
the standard mutual information (MI) defined in terms of KL divergence.
We now set θ= (∆ Li, Ui)andg(∆Li, Ui) =tGiin Lemma 2.1, where t∈R,P=P∆Li,Uiis
the joint distribution of (∆Li, Ui)andQ=P∆LiPUiis the product of the marginal distributions.
Consequently, Lemma 2.1 directly implies that
1For a function f:X →R∪ {−∞ ,+∞}, its convex conjugate is f∗(y)≜supx∈dom( f)⟨x, y⟩ −f(x).

where we let λ= 0 in Eq. (2). Notice that if ϕ(x) =xlogx+c(x−1)for any constant c,
thenIϕ(X;Y)becomes MI. In this case, the optimal λ∗=−logEQ
eg(θ)
in Lemma 2.1, and
Lemma 2.1 recovers the Donsker and Varadhan’s variational formula (cf. Lemma A.1). Here, the
second term in Eq. (1) represents the cumulant generating function of (∆Li, U′
i). By analyzing the
tail behavior of (∆Li, U′
i)and applying Eq. (1), one can derive the final MI-based generalization
bound. For example, if the loss is bounded, Eq. (1) recovers [ 24, Theorem 3.2] by using Hoeffding’s
Lemma.
On one hand, while Eq. (1) is tighter than Eq. (2), the parameter λmay not have an analytic form for
divergences beyond KL and χ2. In this sense, Eq. (2) has its own merits. On the other hand, previous
MI-based generalization bounds use concentration results to further upper bound the second term in
Eq. (1). While this strategy has been successful for the MI case, for instance by using Hoeffding’s
Lemma, it may be challenging to obtain similar concentration results for other f-information. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach to prove generalization bounds for f-information.
3 Conditional f-Information Bounds: Bounded Loss Difference Case
We begin by presenting a general lemma that will serve as a main recipe for obtaining generalization
bounds in this section. This lemma introduces a new variational formula for f-divergence, which
may be of independent interest beyond the context of generalization.
Lemma 3.1. Given random variables X,Y, and a measurable function ffor(X, Y). For every
t∈[b1, b2]⊆R, assume that ϕ∗is invertible within the range of t·f, which we denote by
Γt. Let ϕ∗−1be the inverse of ϕ∗on∪t∈[b1,b2]Γt, and let Y′be an independent copy of Y. If
EX,Y′[f(X, Y′)] = 0 , then
sup
t∈[b1,b2]EX,Y
ϕ∗−1(tf(X, Y))
≤Iϕ(X;Y).
Although Lemma 3.1 is a simple and straightforward result derived from Lemma 2.1 by setting
g=ϕ∗−1◦(tf), it is quite powerful for deriving f-information-based generalization bounds.
Specifically, in the supersample setting, due to the symmetric properties of two columns of eZ, we
setX= ∆Li,Y=Uiandf(∆Li, U′
i) = (−1)U′
i∆Li(where U′
iis an independent copy of Ui), the
condition in Lemma 3.1, namely EX,Y′[f(X, Y′)] = 0 , is clearly met. Then we have
sup
tE∆Li,Ui
ϕ∗−1(tGi)
≤Iϕ(∆Li;Ui).
After carefully choosing b1, b2such that ϕ∗−1is well defined, the main focus is to find a lower bound
for the function ϕ∗−1over a certain interval. We will start with the standard MI case.
3.1 Mutual Information (KL-based) Generalization Bound
Consider ϕ(x) =xlogx+x−1. Its convex conjugate function is ϕ∗(y) =ey−1with the inverse
ϕ∗−1(z) = log(1 + z). Building upon Lemma 3.1, we obtain the following bound:
Theorem 3.1. Assume the loss difference ℓ(w, z1)−ℓ(w, z2)is bounded in [−1,1]for any w∈ W
andz1, z2∈ Z, we have
|Eµ(A)| ≤1
nnX
i=1q
2 (E[∆L2
i] +|E[Gi]|)I(∆Li;Ui).
We remark that a bounded loss difference is a less restrictive assumption than a strictly bounded loss.
For example, if ℓisL-Lipschitz in the second argument, then ℓ(w, z1)−ℓ(w, z2)≤L||z1−z2||.
4Thus, as long as ||z1−z2||is bounded, the loss difference is bounded even when ℓitself is unbounded.
Additionally, we refer to Theorem 3.1 as the “ oracle ” CMI bound because the upper bound itself
includes the expected generalization error at position i,E[Gi], which is precisely the quantity we
aim to bound.
From Theorem 3.1, first, if we simply upper bound the loss difference ∆Li(andGi) by one, Theo-
rem 3.1 recovers [ 24, Theorem 3.2] up to a constant. More importantly, Theorem 3.1 indicates that in
the case of bounded loss difference or bounded loss, solely using I(∆Li;Ui)as the generalization
measure for algorithm Ais insufficient to accurately characterize its generalization error. Specifically,
when 2 

vanishes as nincreases, relying on the MI-based measure alone, i.e.,p
I(∆Li;Ui), will always result in a slow convergence rate for |Eµ(A)|. While similar observations
have been made in recent studies [ 41–43], where it is found that the sub-Gaussian variance proxy in
previous MI bounds may also vanish in some examples, our Theorem 3.1 provides a more straightfor-
ward understanding of the potential looseness of O(p
I(∆Li;Ui)). Additionally, further discussion
comparing our oracle CMI bound with the MI-based results in [ 29,30] is provided in Appendix B.4.
To highlight the differences in our proof techniques compared to previous information-theoretic
generalization bounds, we provide a proof sketch below.

The remaining steps are straightforward. See Appendix B.1 for the complete proof.
It is also worth noting that by letting g=ϕ∗−1andEQ[g] = 0 in the case of KL divergence, we
obtain λ∗= 0in Lemma 2.1. As a result, Eq. (2) becomes equivalent to Eq. (1). In this sense, starting
from Eq. (2) does not compromise the tightness of Eq. (1). Moreover, the proof provides deeper
insights into the tightness of Theorem 3.1, which we will now discuss.
Small Empirical Risk Case or Realizable Setting Previously, fast-rate information-theoretic
generalization bounds in the realizable setting—where the square-root function is removed—have
been derived by demonstrating that the CGF can be negative [ 16,44,23,24], or by invoking the
channel capacity result of the binary channel [44, 24].
Based on Theorem 3.1, the square-root function can be directly removed in the realizable setting.
Specifically, if the learning algorithm Ais an interpolating algorithm, i.e., the training loss is always
minimized to zero, then Gi∈[0,1]always holds. In this case, |E[Gi]|=E[Gi]andE
G2
i
≤E[Gi],
allowing us to obtain E[Gi]≤4I(∆Li;Ui)from Eq. (3). Consequently, Theorem 3.1 simplifies to
Eµ(A)≤4
nPn
i=1I(∆Li;Ui). Note that for this bound to hold, the condition of zero training loss
can be relaxed to the training loss being always no larger than the testing loss.

observe that the proof of our

2a. If
x∈[0,1]always holds,
one can use the inequality
log(1 + x)≥xlog 2 in-
stead, where equality holds
when the loss is zero-one
loss (See Figure 1(Right)
for a visualized illustration).
5As a result, we obtain Eµ(A)≤Pn
i=1I(∆Li;Ui)
nlog 2, which is tighter than the previous bound and will
never be vacuous (i.e. the bound is always smaller than 1) since I(∆Li;Ui)≤H(Ui) = log 2 . In
fact, this bound can exactly characterize the generalization error (i.e., equality holds) if the loss is the
zero-one loss, as demonstrated in [24, Theorem 3.3].
New Fast-Rate Bounds Theorem 3.1 not only recovers the previous fast-rate ld-CMI bound in the
realizable setting but also introduces new fast-rate bounds.
By solving Eq. (3) for |E[Gi]|, we obtain the following bound.
Corollary 3.1. Under the conditions of Theorem 3.1, we have
|Eµ(A)| ≤1

.
This fast-rate bound has not been proved in [ 24], yet it resembles [ 24, Eq. (2)] in structure. Specifically,
the single-loss MI term, 2I(L+
i;Ui)in [24, Eq. (2)], is now substituted with I(∆Li;Ui), and the
empirical risk term, E[LS(W)], is replaced by E
∆L2
i
. Here, ∆Li=L−
i−L+
i, and notice
that both L+
iandL−
ifollow the same marginal distribution due to the symmetric construction of
the supersample, so we can obtain that E

Notably, Eq. (4) hints that if the variance of the single loss in the supersample is sufficiently small, the
bound will decay at the same rate as in the realizable setting, namely O(I(∆Li;Ui)), as the second
term vanishes.
Instead of solving Eq. (3), if we directly upper-bound |E[Gi]|in Theorem 3.1, we can also obtain the
following bound from Theorem 3.1.
Corollary 3.2. Under the conditions of Theorem 3.1, we have

Note that Corollary 3.2 is tighter than Corollary 3.1 by Jensen’s inequality and Pinsker’s inequality.
While we focus on the MI-based or KL-based generalization bound in this section, the inclusion of
total variation (TV) in the second term of Corollary 3.2 expands the scope of the bound. Notably, in
a recent study by [ 34], a component of the form√DTVDKLis also present in their generalization
bounds. Specifically, they derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds using the Zhang-Cutkosky-
Paschalidis (ZCP) divergence, initially explored in [ 45]. Interestingly, the ZCP divergence can be
further upper bounded by O(√DTVDKL+ D TV). Although it remains uncertain whether the first
term in Corollary 3.2 is tighter than DTVor not, we demonstrate that the component√DTVDKLcan
emerge directly in the derivation of KL-based bounds, without using the ZCP divergence. Additionally,
note that the term E
∆L2

in Corollary 3.2 can likewise be replaced by 4Var( L+
i)term.
3.2 Other f–Information-based Generalization Bound
Based on Lemma 3.1, it is straightforward to apply similar techniques to many well-known f-
divergences or f-information measures to obtain generalization bounds. In this section, we dis-
cuss several other f-information-based bounds. Before we study the specific f-divergence, we
remark that, in Section 3.1, our focus was on the unconditional mutual information I(∆Li;Ui).
As illustrated in [ 24], using the data-processing inequality (DPI) and the chain rule, we have
I(∆Li;Ui)≤I(L+
i, L−
i;Ui)≤I(W;Ui|eZi). This makes it easy to derive other CMI variant-
based bounds. While other f-divergences also satisfy DPI, they may not adhere to the chain
rule. Accordingly, for these cases, we use the disintegrated conditional f-information, defined as
Iz
ϕ(X;Y)≜Dϕ(PXY|z||PX|zPY|z)(noting that I(X;Y|Z) =EZh
IZ
ϕ(X;Y))i
), instead of the
unconditional quantity. In this context, at least Iϕ(∆Li;Ui|eZi)≤Iϕ(W;Ui|eZi)still holds, ensuring
that the hypothesis-based conditional f-information bound can be directly derived.
6X2-based Generalization Bound Consider ϕ(x) = ( x−1)2. Its convex conjugate is ϕ∗(y) =
y2
4+y. For y≥ −2, the inverse of conjugate function ϕ∗−1(z) = 2(√z+ 1−1)exists. Since
2(√z+ 1−1)≥log(1+ z), any lower bound that holds for log(1+ z)will also hold for 2(√z+ 1−1).
See Figure 1(Left) for a visualization. In other words, all the bounds in Section 3.1 will also hold
when using χ2-divergence. This can also be immediately noticed by the inequality DKL(P||Q)≤
χ2(P||Q)[33]. We defer the formal disintegrated χ2-information bound in Appendix B.7.
Squared Hellinger (SH) Distance Generalization Bound Consider ϕ(x) = (√x−1)2, and its
convex conjugate is ϕ∗(y) =y
1−y. Fory∈(−∞,1), the inverse function ϕ∗−1(z) =z
1+zexists for
z∈(−1,+∞). We then have the following oracle conditional squared Hellinger (SH)-information
bound.
Theorem 3.2. Under the same conditions in Theorem 3.1, we have

Jeffrey’s divergence [ 46], which is defined as DJeffrey (P||Q)≜DKL(P||Q) + D KL(Q||P), is an
f-divergence with the convex function ϕ(x) = (x−1) log x. Since DJSD(P||Q)≤1
4DJeffrey (P||Q)
[47], a Jeffrey’s divergence-based bound can be derived as a corollary from Theorem 3.3 (and clearly,
also from Theorem 3.1 due to the non-negativity of KL divergence).
Notably, Theorems 3.2-3.3 share similar expressions with Theorem 3.1, and deriving analogous
corollaries to Corollaries 3.1-3.2 is feasible (see Appendix B.7).
In the proofs of Theorems 3.2 and Theorem 3.3, we continue to use x−ax2to lower bound the inverse
of conjugate functionsx
1+xandlog(2−e−x)for SH-information and JS-information, respectively.
However, due to the complexity of handling log(2−e−x)in the context of JS-information, we opted
for a much rougher selection of the parameter athan in the proof of Theorem 3.1 for simplicity.
Consequently, the constants in Theorem 3.3 are not optimal and can be refined with a more fine-
grained analysis.
4 Extension to Unbounded Loss Difference
Previous bounds are typically applicable when dealing with bounded loss differences (albeit not
necessarily within the range of [−1,1]). This limitation arises from the fact that the function ϕ∗−1
may fail to exist in Lemma 3.1 when fis unbounded, regardless of any non-trivial adjustments made
to the range of t. To overcome this limitation, we now extend our analysis to the case of unbounded
loss differences by refining Lemma 3.1. One crucial modification to Lemma 3.1 involves defining the
measurable function g=tϕ∗−1· 1|f|≤Cfor some C≥0, where 1is the indicator function.
We present the following lemma tailored for unbounded functions.
Lemma 4.1. LetXbe an arbitrary random variable, εbe a Rademacher variable, and t∈(−b, b).
Assume that there exists a constant C≥0such that ϕ∗is invertible in (−bC, bC ). Ifϕ∗(0) = 0 , then
sup
t∈(−b,b)EX,ε
ϕ∗−1(tεX)· 1|X|≤C
≤Iϕ(X;ε).
7Note that ϕ∗(0) = 0 is satisfied by all divergences discussed in Section 3. Armed with
Lemma 4.1, our proof strategy hinges on separately bounding the truncated terms E
Gi· 1|X|≤C
andE
Gi· 1|X|>C
. To achieve this, we utilize Lemma 4.1 along with similar lower-bounding
techniques as detailed in Section 3 to bound the first term. For the second term, we invoke Hölder’s
inequality, drawing inspiration from prior works such as [25, 27].
Before presenting the refined bound for unbounded loss difference, we introduce some additional nota-
tions. Define the Lpnorm of a random variable X∼Pas||X||p≜(
(EP|X|p)1
pforp∈[1,∞),
ess sup |X|forp=∞,
where ess sup |X|≜inf{M:P(|X|> M) = 0}is the essential supremum. Furthermore, let the f-
divergence generated by the convex function ϕα(x) =|x−1|αbeDϕα(P||Q)≜EQh
dP
dQ−1αi
.
This divergence, which takes χ2-divergence and total variation as special cases (with α= 2 and
α= 1, respectively), and it has been utilized in previous information-theoretic generalization bounds
[25, 29, 30]. We denote the corresponding f-information of Dϕα(P||Q)asIϕα.
Now, we are ready to present a MI-based bound, with straightforward extensions to other f-
information measures.

.
Since Uiis a Bernoulli random variable, according to [ 25, Lemma 1], we know that Iϕα(∆Li;Ui)<
1 + 2α−1forα∈[1,2]and remains bounded for other values of αas well. Thus, Theorem 4.1
generally preserves the boundedness property of the original CMI bound unless ∆Lihas an infinite
Lqβ-norm. Additionally, due to truncation, ζ1≤√
2Cfor any given C, while ζ2heavily depends on
the tail behavior of ∆Li∼P∆Li(orGi∼PU′
iP∆Liequivalently). We now discuss several common
cases.
Bounded Loss Notably, Theorem 4.1 also covers the bounded loss cases. For instance, if ℓ
is bounded in [0,1]a.s., setting C= 1 in Theorem 4.1 leads to ζ2= 0, directly recovering
Theorem 3.1 for bounded loss. In fact, the choice of C= 1might not necessarily be the optimal for
ℓ∈[0,1]. Particularly, for certain C∈(0,1), we let α= 1andβ=∞, then ζ2=||∆Li||∞and
(Iϕα(∆Li;Ui))1/α=ITV(∆Li;Ui). Since DTV≲√DKLby Pinsker’s inequality, this alternative
choice holds potential for even tighter bounds than Theorem 3.1.
“Almost Bounded” Loss When the loss function exhibits sub-Gaussian or sub-Gamma tail behav-
iors, the probability P(|Gi|> C)decays rapidly. By carefully selecting the threshold C, the domi-
nance of the first term in the bound can be expected. Assume the loss difference ∆Liis sub-Gaussian
with certain variance proxy, say, σ. Setting C=σandq= 2, we have P(|∆Li|> C)≤2e−1
and||∆Li||qβ≲√qβσ [48]. Consequently, each term in the summation of Theorem 4.1 simpli-
fies toO
σp
I(∆Li;Ui) +σ(2e)1−α

. However, the relationship between
I(∆Li;Ui)andIϕα(∆Li;Ui)is not clear beyond the cases of α= 1 andα= 2 (corresponding
to total variation and χ2-information, respectively). Studying the overall behavior of the bound
represents an intriguing direction for future research. Furthermore, consider the alternative case
withC= 0andq= 1, where the first term in Theorem 4.1 becomes zero. The second term, using
||∆Li||β≲√βσfor sub-gaussian random variables, becomes O(σq
α
α−1αp
Iϕα(∆Li;Ui)). Com-
pared to existing MI bounds, e.g., O(σp

DKL(P||Q)
andDKL(P||Q)≤χ2(P||Q)thatIϕ1(∆Li;Ui)≲p
I(∆Li;Ui)≲p
Iϕ2(∆Li;Ui), suggesting
that some α∈(1,2)may yield a tighter bound than MI.
Heavy-tailed Loss Heavy-tailed losses, although lacking universally agreed definitions, typically
refer to the cases where the moment-generating function (MGF) does not exists (away from 0) [49].
8Remarkably, our Theorem 4.1 remains meaningful for such losses since it does not rely on the
existence of the MGF of the loss function. Specifically, without any additional knowledge about the
tail behavior of ∆Li, we have the following result from Theorem 4.1.
Corollary 4.1. Under the conditions in Theorem 4.1, let γ=q−1

. This is an extension
of [25, Theorem 3], incorporating individual techniques [ 6] and loss-difference methods [ 24] in the
supersample setting. Notably, our Corollary 4.1 improves upon [ 25, Theorem 3], as γ→0may
not necessarily be the optimal choice. Furthermore, it is also intriguing to investigate whether our
Corollary 4.1 can recover [29, Corollary 5].
5 Numerical Results
In this section, we conduct an empirical comparison between our novel conditional f-information
generalization bounds and several existing information-theoretic generalization bounds. Our ex-
perimental setup closely aligns with the settings in [ 24]. In particular, we undertake two distinct
prediction tasks as follows: 1) Linear Classifier on Synthetic Gaussian Dataset , where we train a
simple linear classifier using a synthetic Gaussian dataset; 2) CNN and ResNet-50 on Real-World
Datasets . The second task follows the same deep learning training protocol as in [ 22], involves
training a 4-layer CNN on a binary MNIST dataset (“ 4vs9”) [50] and fine-tuning a ResNet-50 model
[51], pretrained on ImageNet [ 52], on CIFAR10 [ 53]. In both tasks, we assess prediction error as our
performance metric. That is, we utilize the zero-one loss function to compute generalization error.
Note that during training, we use the cross-entropy loss as a surrogate to enable optimization with
gradient-based methods.

The comparison of generalization bounds mainly focuses on those presented in Section 3. Specif-
ically, we consider the oracle bounds, given in Theorem 3.1, Theorem 3.2, and Theorem 3.3,
which we denote as CMI(Oracle) ,CSHI(Oracle) , and CJSI(Oracle) , respectively. Given that the
9squared Hellinger-information is a tighter measure than MI, and the constants in Theorem 3.2 ex-
hibit less pessimism compared to those in the JS-information bound, we introduce two additional
squared Hellinger-information bounds for comparison. The first one, akin to Corollary 3.2, is
Eµ(A)≤1

P∆Li|Ui,eZi, P∆Li|eZii
IeZi
H2(∆Li;Ui)(cf. Corol-
lary B.1 in Appendix B.7), denoted as CSHI(Var) . The second one adopts a more pessimistic choice
by replacing E[∆L2
i]with the constant 1, labeled as CSHI(Worst) . Additionally, we include three
previous information-theoretic generalization bounds as baselines: the original ld-CMI bound in [ 24,
Theorem3.1] ( ld-CMI ), the sharpness-based single-loss MI bound in [ 24, Theorem 4.5] ( Sharpness ),
and the binary KL-based CMI bound in [ 23, Theorem 5] ( Binary kl ). Further details on experimental
settings are available in the Appendix D.
The final results are shown in Figure 2. First, we observe that for the linear classifier on the two-class
data (Figure 2a), most bounds are close to the exact generalization error, with Sharpness being
the tightest. Note that the sharpness-based MI bound in [ 24, Theorem 4.5] is applicable solely for
zero-one loss. As the prediction task becomes more complex (Figures 2b-2f), our squared Hellinger-
information-based bounds are the tightest. Specifically, the squared Hellinger-information-based
bound is always tighter than the CMI bound in the oracle type. Notably, CSHI(Var) also outperforms
all other f-information-based bounds in these cases, and even the pessimistic CSHI(Worst) bound
outperforms them, except for Sharpness , in Figures 2c-2d. Additionally, by comparing CMI(Oracle)
andld-CMI , we see significant potential for improving the original ld-CMI bound. Finally, although
the JS-information bound contains relatively pessimistic constants, it still outperforms some MI-based
bounds in many cases (e.g., Figures 2c-2e). These observations suggest that considering alternative
f-information rather than MI is indeed necessary for studying generalization.
6 Other Related Works and Limitations
In addition to the studies mentioned previously, there have been recent developments in information-
theoretic generalization bounds in the supersample setting. For example, [ 54,44] propose a “leave-
one-out” (LOO) construction of supersamples, reducing the size of the supersample from 2nto
n+ 1. Additionally, [ 55] constructs a “neighboring-hypothesis” matrix, enabling the derivation
of a hypothesis-conditioned CMI bound. The key component in this bound is the product of the
new CMI term and an algorithmic stability parameter. Furthermore, significant progress has been
made in understanding MI or CMI as generalization measures in stochastic convex optimization
(SCO) problems. Specifically, [ 56–58] all point out that MI or CMI bounds can be non-vanishing
in some SCO examples, while the exact generalization error is vanishing. Notably, [ 58] discovers a
“CMI-accuracy tradeoff” phenomenon in certain scenarios: For the generalization error to be upper
bounded by a vanishing parameter, the original hypothesis-based CMI must be lower bounded by
the reciprocal of this parameter (or even the reciprocal of its square), indicating that the CMI bound
cannot characterize the learnability of such problems. Although this limitation is currently only
observed for hypothesis-based CMI, it is anticipated to hold in other variants of CMI, such as ld-CMI.
Our work also contributes to understanding the potential looseness of previous CMI generalization
bounds. However, the current state of our bounds cannot explain or resolve the limitation presented in
[58] in a non-trivial way. Nonetheless, our framework provides some intuition that, as long as a gap
exists between ϕ∗−1andx−ax2(see Figure 1(Right)), there will always be room for constructing
counterexamples that challenge information-theoretic measures, although such examples may be
rare. Another limitation of this work is the lack of a high-probability generalization guarantee. There
are two potential directions to address this: either by applying similar techniques to the framework
in [59], which is the PAC-Bayesian counterpart of the CMI bound, or by combining it with recent
information-bottleneck generalization bounds [60, 61].

A Technical Lemmas
Lemma A.1 (Donsker and Varadhan’s variational formula) .LetQ,Pbe probability measures on
Θ, for any bounded measurable function f: Θ→R, we have DKL(Q||P) = supfEθ∼Q[f(θ)]−
logEθ∼P[expf(θ)].
Lemma A.2. LetPandQbe two probability measures on the same metric space X. Letfbe some
measurable function associated with X. The total variation distance between PandQcan be written
as
DTV(P, Q) =1
Msup
||f||∞≤M|EP[f(X)]−EQ[f(X)]|.
Lemma A.3. The following inequalities hold:
log(1 + x)≥x−ax2fora≥1
2andx∈1
2a−1,1−1
2a
, (5)
x
1 +x≥x−ax2fora≥1andx∈1
a−1,1−1
a
, (6)
log(2−e−x)≥x−ax2fora≥4andx∈[−1
2,1
2]. (7)
Proof. We prove these inequalities separately.
We first prove Eq. (5) We analyze the function f(x) = log(1 + x)−x+ax2. By computing the
first derivative f′(x):
f′(x) =1
1 +x−1 + 2 ax=x(2a−1 + 2 ax)
1 +x.
Letf′(x) = 0 , we have x(2a−1 + 2 ax) = 0 , which gives two critical points:
x= 0 and x=1−2a
2a.
Note that x=1−2a
2ais within the interval1
2a−1,1−1
2a
. Then computing the second derivative
f′′(x):
f′′(x) =−1
(1 +x)2+ 2a.
Since a≥1
2and−1< x < 1, we have f′′(x)≥0, indicating that f(x)is either concave upwards or
linear at these critical points. It is easy to check that the minimum value f(0) = 0 , sof(x)≥0in
this interval. Hence, log(1 + x)≥x−ax2holds for a≥1
2andx∈1
2a−1,1−1
2a
.
We then prove Eq. (6) We analyze the function f(x) =x
1+x−x+ax2. By simplifying this
function, we have:
f(x) =x2(a−1 +ax)
1 +x.
Notice that a−1≥0and1−a≤ax≤a−1, then it is easy to see that the numerator x2(a−1+ax)
is always non-negative for x∈1
a−1,1−1
a
anda≥1. In addition, the denominator 1 +xis
always positive for x∈1
a−1,1−1
a
. Therefore, f(x) =x2((a−1)+ax)
1+x≥0.
Consequently, we have shown thatx
1+x≥x−ax2fora≥1andx∈1
a−1,1−1
a
.
15We then prove Eq. (7) We analyze the function f(x) = log(2 −e−x)−x+ax2. By taking its
derivative, we have
f′(x) =1
2ex−1−1 + 2 ax.
We now demonstrate that the function f′(x)>0forx∈
0,1
2
andf′(x)≤0forx∈
−1
2,0
.
The second derivative of f(x)is
f′′(x) =−2ex
(2ex−1)2+ 2a.
Lett= 2ex, since x∈[−1
2,1
2], we know that t∈[2e−1
2,2e1
2]. Hence, we reformulate f′′(x)as
f′′(t) =−t
(t−1)2+ 2a=−1
t+1
t−2+ 2a.
Notice that t+1
tis monotonically increasing when t >1, sof′′(t)is monotonically increasing in
t∈[2e−1
2,2e1
2]. Consequently,
f′′(t)≥f′′(t= 2e−1
2)≈ −26.7 + 2 a.
Additionally, it is clear that f′′(x= 0) = f′′(t= 2e0) =−2 + 2 a >0fora≥4. WWe now
consider two cases:
Case 1. Ifa >13.35, then f′′(t)≥f′′(t= 2e−1
2)≥0. Hence, f′(x)is monotonically increasing
inx∈[−1
2,1
2]. Since f′(x= 0) = 0 , we demonstrate that f′(x)>0forx∈
0,1
2
and
f′(x)≤0forx∈
−1
2,0
.
Case 2. Ifa≤13.35, then there exists an x0such that f′′(x0)≤0. Recall that f′′(x= 0) =
f′′(t= 2e0) =−2 + 2 a >0andf′′(x)is monotonically increasing in x∈[−1
2,1
2], we
know that such x0∈[−1
2,0]andf′(x)≥0for all x∈
0,1
2
. Thus, f′(x)first decreases
inx∈[−1
2, x0]then increases in x∈[x0,1
2].
Since f′(x=−1
2) =1
2e−1
2−1−a≈3.69−a <0fora≥4, we conclude that f′(x)>0
forx∈
0,1
2
andf′(x)≤0forx∈
−1
2,0
.
Consequently, we know that f(x)decreases in x∈[−1
2,0]and increases in [0,1
2]. By checking
f(x)≥f(0) = 0 , the inequality log(2−e−x)≥x−ax2holds for a≥4andx∈
−1
2,1

.
This completes the proof.
B Omitted Proofs in Section 3 and Additional Results
B.1 Proof of Theorem 3.1
Proof. Lemma 3.1 indicates that
I(∆Li;Ui)≥ sup

Recall that Gi= (−1)Ui∆Li, and let a=|E[Gi]|

2. Since a≥1
2and1−1
2a≥0, we can apply
Eq. (5) in Lemma A.3 to have f(x) = log(1 + x)−x+ax2≥0forx∈[1
2a−1,1−1
2a].
Hence, by Gi∈[−1,1], we restrict t∈[1
2a−1,1−1
2a]and let x=tGito have the following
inequality,

t>−1E[log (1 + tGi)]≥ sup

16where the last equality holds when t∗=E[Gi]
2aE[G2
i].
We now show that t∗can indeed be reached within t∈[1
2a−1,1−1
2a].
Substituting a=|E[Gi]|
2E[G2
i]+1
2, we can see that t∗=E[Gi]
|E[Gi]|+E[G2
i]. In addition, notice that
1−1
2a=|E[Gi]|
|E[Gi]|+E[G2
i]and1
2a−1 =−|E[Gi]|
|E[Gi]|+E[G2

Clearly, either E[Gi] =−|E[Gi]|orE[Gi] =|E[Gi]|holds. Consequently, t∗can be achieved at
one of the endpoints of [1
2a−1,1−1
2a].
Therefore,
I(∆Li;Ui)≥ sup

E2[Gi]≤2 

Notice that |E[Gi]| ≥0, we now solve the inequality above for |E[Gi]|. LetA1=E

andA2=
I(∆Li;Ui), then by the quadratic-root formula, the solution to E2[Gi]−2A2|E[Gi]| −2A1A2≤0

4A2
2+ 8A1A2

Therefore, we have

≤2I(∆Li;Ui) +q

where the second inequality is by√x+y≤√x+√y.
The remaining steps are routine, which will complete the proof.

B.4 Comparison with “Online-to-PAC” Generalization Framework
We now discuss the comparison with [ 29,30], consider the case of the KL or mutual information.
The only explicit expected generalization bound provided in [ 30] is their Corollary 21, which recovers
the square-root bound of O(p
I(W;S)/n). This bound is clearly weaker than our fast-rate bound in
our Corollary 3.1-3.2, due to the omission of vanishing terms in our oracle bound in Theorem 3.1. In
fact, a more refined MI bound is presented in the earlier version of [ 30], namely [ 29, Corollary 4].
This bound takes the form
|Eµ(A)| ≤r
4EZ∥ℓ(·, Z)−EZ[ℓ(·, Z)]∥2∞I(W;S)
n,
which can indeed be derived from [ 30] due to the generality of their framework. Recall that our
Theorem 3.1 gives the bound
|Eµ(A)| ≤1
nnX
i=1q
(2E[∆L2
i] + 2|E[Gi]|)I(∆Li;Ui).
Notably, because we apply individual and loss-difference techniques, our averaged MI term is
always tighter than that of [ 29,30], as1
nPn
i=1p
I(∆Li;Ui)≤q
I(W;S)
ngenerally holds. To fairly
compare our framework with theirs, we ignore the difference between MI terms and only focus on
the novel components of each bound, specifically EZ∥ℓ(·, Z)−EZ[ℓ(·, Z)]∥2
∞in their work and
E[∆L2
i] +|E[Gi]|in ours, let’s consider the following simple example:
Example 1. LetW ∈ [−1,1], and let the input space be Z={1,−1}. Assume µ=Unif(Z), i.e.Z
is a Rademacher variable. Consider a convex and 1-Lipschitz loss function ℓ(w, z) =−w·z.
Under the ERM algorithm, W=A(S) =1
nPn
i=1Zi. Notice that for any w∈ W ,EZ[ℓ(w, Z)] =
1
2(−w·(1−1)) = 0 , hence EZ∥ℓ(·, Z)−EZ[ℓ(·, Z)]∥2
∞=EZ∥ℓ(·, Z)∥2
∞= 1. In contrast,
since ∆Li∈[−1,1]in this case, E[∆L2
i]≤E[|∆Li|]and|E[Gi]| ≤E[|∆Li|], we have E[∆L2
i] +
|E[Gi]| ≤2E[|∆Li|]. Moreover, E[|∆Li|] =E[|W·(Z+
i−Z−
i)|]≤2
nE[|Pn
i=1Zi|]≤2√n, where
the last step is by the Khintchine-Kahane inequality [62, Theorem D.9].
Thus, in this example, EZ∥ℓ(·, Z)−EZ[ℓ(·, Z)]∥2
∞= 1, while our bound E[∆L2
i] +|E[Gi]| ≤
2E[|∆Li|]≤ O(1√n)shows a tighter convergence rate. Consequently, even without using the
individual trick and loss-difference technique, our bound (Theorem 3.1) can still be tighter than
[29,30] in terms of convergence rate in this example. This suggests that, MI-based bounds in [ 29,30]
can still encounter limitations (e.g., slow convergence rate), as with previous MI-based bounds.
Finally, to clarify the comparison, we only demonstrate that our oracle CMI bound could be tighter.
It is worth noting that the unpublished version of [ 30] represents an initial exploration of their
“online-to-PAC” generalization framework. As such, the results in their current version may primarily
aim to recover previous findings, and their framework likely has room for further advancements.

We now show that t∗can indeed be reached within t∈[1

Substituting a, we can see that
t∗=E[Gi|˜zi]

In addition, 1−1

20C.2 Proof of Theorem 4.1
Proof. Since (−1)Uiis a Rademacher variable and ϕ∗(0) = e0−1 = 0 for KL divergence, we
can apply Lemma 4.1 first then follow the similar developments in Theorem 3.1 by controlling
tGi∈[−1,1]. In particular, for any C≥0,

D Experimental Details
Our experimental setup largely follows [ 24], and the code of our experiments can be found at
https://github.com/ZiqiaoWangGeothe/Conditional-f-Information-Bound.
Linear Classifier on Synthetic Gaussian Dataset In this experiment, similar to [ 24], we use the
popular Python package scikit-learn [63] to generate synthetic Gaussian data. Each feature of data
is drawn independently from a Gaussian distribution, ensuring that all features are informative for
the class labels. Specifically, we set the dimension of feature vector to 5and create different classes
of points, which are normally distributed. We train the linear classifier using full-batch gradient
descent with a fixed learning rate of 0.01for a total of 300epochs, employing early stopping when the
training error falls below a threshold (e.g., <0.5%). To ensure robustness and statistical significance,
we generate 50different supersamples for each experiment. Within each supersample, we create 100
different mask random variables, resulting in a total of 5,000runs for each experimental setting. This
thorough setup allows us to compare and the disintegrated f-information-based bounds.
CNN and ResNet-50 on Real-World Datasets In these experiments, the same setup is initially
given in [ 22], and is also used in [ 23,24,61]. Specifically, we draw k1samples of eZandk2samples
ofUfor each given ˜z. For the CNN on the binary MNIST dataset, we set k1= 5 andk2= 30 .
The 4-layer CNN model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001and a
momentum coefficient of β1= 0.9. The training process spans 200epochs with a batch size of
128. For ResNet-50 on CIFAR10, we set k1= 2andk2= 40 . The ResNet model is trained using
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.01and a momentum coefficient of 0.9for
a total of 40epochs. The batch size for this experiment is set to 64. In the SGLD experiment, we
train a 4-layer CNN on the binary MNIST dataset with a batch size of 100for40epochs. The initial
learning rate is 0.01and decays by a factor of 0.9after every 100iterations. Let tbe the iteration
index; the inverse temperature of SGLD is given by min{4000,max{100,10et/100}}. We set the
training sample size to n= 4000 , and k1= 5andk2= 30 . Checkpoints are saved every 4epochs.
All these experiments are conducted using NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 40 GB of memory. For more
comprehensive details, including model architectures, we recommend referring to [22–24].
E CMI Framework from the Perspective of Coin-Betting Sequences
Deriving generalization bounds from a coin-betting perspective is inspired by [ 64,1,34]. We now
adapt this strategy to derive CMI bounds, invoking inequalities similar to those in Lemma A.3.
Assume ℓ∈[0,1]. Let∆ℓi∈[−1,1]be a sequence of “continuous coin” outcomes chosen arbitrarily,
and at each round i, a player bets ci≥0money on the sign of the outcome εi∈ {− 1,1}. Then, ∆ℓi
is revealed, and the bettor wins or loses ciεi∆ℓimoney.
22Let the initial wealth Wealth 0= 1. The wealth at the end of round nis:
Wealth n= Wealth n−1+cnεn∆ℓn= 1 +nX
i=1ciεi∆ℓi.
Notice that ci∈[0,Wealth i−1]. Now consider a strategy where the player always bets a fixed
fraction t∈[0,1]of the current money, i.e., ci=tWealth i−1. Then:
Wealth n(t) = Wealth n−1+tεn∆ℓnWealth n−1=nY
i=1(1 +tεi∆ℓi).
It follows that
log Wealth n(t) =nX
i=1log(1 + tεi∆ℓi).
Unlike the traditional online gambling game, we incorporate the individual technique from [ 6] by
analyzing the expected log-wealth of the ith bet2, given by
Wi(t) =Eεi,∆Lilog (1 + tεi∆Li).
There are two kinds of players: those guessing the coin outcome randomly and those with side
information. Let ε= (−1)Uiwhere Ui∼Bern(1 /2). The average log-wealth of the random
guesser is EU′
i,∆Lilog(1 + t(−1)U′i∆Li), and the average log-wealth of the informed player is
Wi(t) =EUi,∆Lilog(1 + t(−1)U
i∆Li).
Clearly, the value of side information impacts the second player’s income. To quantify this impact,
by the DV-representation of KL divergence (cf. Lemma A.1), we have
I(∆Li;Ui)≥sup
t∈(0,1)EUi,∆Lilog 
1 +t(−1)Ui∆Li
−logEU′

t∈(0,1)EUi,∆Lilog 

where the last equality holds because EU′

i∆Li=E∆Lih
EU′
it(−1)U′

E∆Lit∆Li−t∆Li

appears in Eq. (17) in the form of infλE∆Li,U′
ih
ϕ∗
log(1 + t(−1)U′
i∆Li) +λi
−λ.
Similar to [ 1], by the inequality log(1 + x)≥x−x2forx≥ −0.68(see Figure 1(Right) for a
visualization of this inequality), we have
I(∆Li;Ui)≥sup
t∈(0,1)EUi,∆Lilog 
1 +t(−1)Ui∆Li
≥sup
t∈(0,0.68)EUi,∆Lilog 

t(−1)Ui∆Li−t2

4E2
Ui,∆Li
(−1)Ui∆Li
,
We then have
EUi,∆Li
(−1)Ui∆Li
≤2p
I(∆Li;Ui). (18)
2This can also be interpreted as having nplayers each place a single bet with t, solog Wealth n(t)represents
their collective log-wealth.
23Moreover, we now assume that the side information is “perfect” such that (−1)Ui∆Li≥0(i.e. an
interpolating or overfitting algorithm) always holds for each i, namely the income is always positive.
Under this condition, the players can safely set t= 1, that is, the players “all-in” their money. Then,
bylog (1 + x)≥x
(1+x)forx >−1, we have
I(∆i;Ui)≥EUi,∆Lilog 
1 + (−1)Ui∆Li
≥EUi,∆Li(−1)Ui∆Li
1 + (−1)Ui∆Li
≥EUi,∆Li(−1)Ui∆Li
2,
which gives us
EUi,∆Li(−1)Ui∆Li≤2I(∆i;Ui). (19)
Consequently, recovering several existing ld-CMI bounds (up to a constant) from Eq. (19) and Eq. (18)
is straightforward.
24NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1.Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We highlight the motivations and contributions of this work in the abstract and
introduction.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
•The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
•The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
•It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2.Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 6
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
•The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
•The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
•The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
•The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
•If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
•While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3.Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
25Justification: All assumptions are given in the theorem statements or in the preliminary
section, and all the technical details are provided in Appendix.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
•All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
•All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
•The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
•Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4.Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our implementation also follows the previous works, as pointed out in the
experiments section, and we explained all the additional details that needed for reproducing
our results in the main text and Appendix D.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
•If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
•Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
•While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a)If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b)If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c)If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d)We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5.Open access to data and code
26Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We only use synthetic dataset and some well-known public image datasets,
which can be easily found, and we provide our source code in Appendix D and in the
supplementary materials.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
•Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
•The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ( https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy ) for more details.
•The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
•The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
•At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
•Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6.Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Appendix D.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
•The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7.Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the standard deviations in some figures in Figure 2.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
•The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
27•The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
•It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
•It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
•For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
•If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8.Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Appendix D.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
•The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
•The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
•The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9.Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines ?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our work conforms the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
•If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
•The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10.Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not see any societal impacts with our paper, as it is purely theoretical in
nature.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
•If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
28•Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
•The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
•The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
•If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11.Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: There is no such risk.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
•Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
•Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
•We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12.Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite the datasets and models properly.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
•The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
•For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
•If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
29•For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
•If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13.New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No new asset.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
•Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
•The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
•At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14.Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
•The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
•Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
•We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
•For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
