Abstract
The swift advancement in the scales and capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) positions them as promising tools for a variety of downstream tasks. In
addition to the pursuit of better performance and the avoidance of violent feedback
on a certain prompt, to ensure the responsibility of the LLM, much attention is
drawn to the robustness of LLMs. However, existing evaluation methods mostly
rely on traditional question answering datasets with predefined supervised labels,
potentially ignoring the superior generation capabilities of contemporary LLMs. To
investigate the robustness of LLMs while using their generation ability, we pro-
pose a novel rational evaluation pipeline that leverages reward models as diagnostic
tools to evaluate the long conversation generated from more challenging open ques-
tions by LLMs, which we refer to as the Reward Model for Reasonable Robustness
Evaluation (TREvaL ). Longer conversations manifest the comprehensive grasp of
language models in terms of their proficiency in understanding questions, a capa-
bility not entirely encompassed by individual words or letters. Extensive empirical
experiments demonstrate that TREvaL provides an identification for the lack of ro-
bustness of nowadays LLMs. Notably, we are surprised to discover that robustness
tends to decrease as fine-tuning (SFT and RLHF) is conducted, calling for more
attention on the robustness during the alignment process.
1 Introduction
Modern large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention due to their impressive
performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, including but not limited to question answering,
coding (Li et al., 2023a; Huang et al., 2023a), embodied agent tasks (Di Palo et al., 2023; Huang
et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023a). When provided with a finite-length prompt, these models can infer
its intention and generate an answer akin to human capability. The content of the answer reflects
the capabilities of the LLM. Ideally, we desire that the output is both informative, offering a wealth
of pertinent and valuable information, and benign, devoid of any offensive language or intentions,
such as providing guidance on orchestrating a terrorist attack.
Recently, there has been a growing body of research on assessing the robustness of LLMs, which
is defined as the drop rate of performance under possible perturbations. Current works involve
demonstrating adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks on LLMs (Wang et al.,
2023b; Zhu et al., 2023), and evaluating robustness through the measurement of accuracy drop
rates during adversarial attacks (Zhu et al., 2023; Ajith et al., 2023), where classification datasets
such as GLUE and ANLI are commonly used as the benchmarks, along with attack methods like
bertattack (Li et al., 2020) and textfooler (Jin et al., 2020). Subsequently, the reductions in accuracy
on these specific datasets are used as the evidence of insufficient robustness.

Figure 1: This Figure illustrates the primary workflow of the TREvaL process during a single evalu-
ation round. Clean prompts undergo various types of perturbations and are assessed in comparison.
The evaluation results indicate that LLMs exhibit a lack of robustness when confronted with word-
level perturbations.
Although traditional NLP tasks are widely used to test the robustness of LLMs, it is also worth con-
sidering whether a traditional BERT-based task can fully identify the generative capacity of a LLM.
As known, language models can be broadly categorized into two types: BERT (Devlin et al., 2018)-
based Mask Language Models (MLM), and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) (Ouyang
et al., 2022)-based LLM models. The former is often responsible for classification task, simple
question and answer (Q&A) task, annotation task, while the latter serves as an omniscient and
omnipotent entity, akin to a helpful and benign human, capable of answering any question helpfully
and harmlessly. Therefore, here comes a question:
Are large language models robust to word level perturbations on open questions?
Accordingly, we put forward an evaluation framework: TREvaL to test the robustness of LLMs. In
particular, we select 1k open questions from Natural Questions datasets (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019),
add three types of word-level perturbations to them and induce the language models to generate
extensive responses. We send both clean and affected conversations to a reward model and calculate
the reward drop rates after the perturbations.
This approach effectively harnesses the generative capacity of language models, as longer responses
provide a more comprehensive exposition of explanations to questions, thereby better reflecting the
extent to which the model is influenced by word-level perturbations.
We calculate the drop rate as an indicator of reduced robustness. Our contribution can be summa-
rized as follows:
•We rethink the existing evaluation methods which use closed or open-ended questions to
evaluate the word level robustness of LLMs. We push the research frontier by leveraging
2Under review as submission to TMLR
the full generative potential of LLMs using open questions . Accordingly, we introduce
TREvaL , a reasonable evaluation method of LLMs robustness.
•We investigate the robustness across varying stages, perturbation levels, and sizes of LLMs.
We find the LLMs’ performance suffer from word level perturbations. Importantly, we
observe that the fine-tuning process leads to a reduction in the robustness w.r.t. helpfulness.
To corroborate this phenomenon, we construct loss landscapes at each training stage of
LLMs, thereby furnishing empirical evidence that bolsters this conjecture and underscores
the importance of preserving robustness while striving for enhanced model performance.
2 Related Work
Foundation LLMs Large language models are emerging and evolving at an remarkable rate,
transforming the landscape of artificial intelligence (Casper et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022; Bommasani
et al., 2021; Kaddour et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a; Lin & Chen, 2023). Notably, in the open-source
community, LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) has garnered significant attention as an improved
version following the original LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), alongside Vicuna (Chiang et al.,
2023) and Beaver (Dai et al., 2023), which have demonstrated commendable effectiveness. Within
the closed-source community, models such as ChatGPT (Cha, 2023) and Claude (Cla, 2023) exhibit
remarkable advancements. In this study, we employ Beaver family and LLaMA-2 series to test.
Furthermore, we span from pretrained to Supervised Fine-Tuning(SFT), Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback(RLHF) stages, to investigate the impact of fine-tuning and parameter scales
on robustness. We utilize Beavertail (Ji et al., 2023)’s open-source Reward Model, Cost Model and
ArmoRM-LLaMA3-8B-v0.1 reward model as referees in this exploration. We do a small ablation
study to make sure these reward models score is somehow aligned with human preference as shown
in Table 13 and Table 14.
Question Types The evaluative questions or prompts employed in this research field vary consid-
erably in type. For the purpose of clarity, we categorize these questions into three distinct classes:
closed questions, open-ended questions, and open questions. Closed questions are those who offer
limited response options, such as classification tasks or multiple-choice questions. Representative
datasets include GLUE (Wang et al., 2018), ANLI (Nie et al., 2019), IMDB (Maas et al., 2011), and
AG News (Zhang et al., 2015). Open-ended questions, in contrast, are prompts that elicit short and
non-unique answers, exemplified by queries like "When is the Christmas Day?". TriviaQA (Joshi
et al., 2017) and a subset of Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) provide two commonly-
used datasets for such questions. Importantly, both closed and open-ended questions usually have
a singular correct response, thereby allowing for accuracy-based evaluation. Open questions, how-
ever, do not possess a unique answer, and we posit that such prompts stimulate the generative
capabilities of LLMs. To this end, we select a subset of 1,000 prompts from the Natural Questions
Dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and Alpagasus Dataset (Chen et al., 2023b) as open questions.
Robustness Evaluation of LLMs Numerous methodologies have been proposed to evaluate
diverse abilities of LLMs (Chan et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023b; Gallegos et al.,
2023;Changetal.,2023). Themostpopularapproachistoquantifytherobustnessunderadversarial
attacks as the accuracy decline in specific BERT-based tasks like classification (Wang et al., 2023b;
Zhu et al., 2023; Ajith et al., 2023). Additionally, except closed questions, open-ended datasets have
also been utilized by calculating F1 scores between the output and human feedback (Ajith et al.,
2023; Li et al., 2023c; Wang et al., 2023a). In comparison, we innovatively introduce trained reward
models as a judge. We focus on assessing the correlation between generated content and selected
open prompts, rather than solely measuring accuracy or similarity. This approach aligns with
the generative capabilities of LLMs and represents a significant departure from previous research

methodologies (Wang et al., 2023c; Shi et al., 2023). There are several works using reward model to
evaluate and train LLMs (Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022). However, to our knowledge,
we are the first who use the reward and cost model to evaluate the robustness of LLMs.
Word-Level Perturbation Operations Prior work has investigated a variety of attacks that
can be applied to language models (Feng et al., 2021). Wei & Zou (2019) set up token-level random
perturbation operations including random insertion, deletion, and swap. Disturbance objectives
have also been achieved using unsupervised data via consistency training (Xie et al., 2020) and
mixed-sample data (Zhang et al., 2017). Our research concentrates on word-level perturbations
such as word swapping, synonym substitution, and common misspellings, which frequently arise
in daily usage. Importantly, these attacks do not alter the semantic labels of the prompts from a
human-centric perspective, which is a critical consideration.
3 Reward Model for Reasonable Robustness Evaluation (TREvaL)
3.1 Datasets, Reward Model and LLMs
Datasets Natural Questions(NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) is a Q&A dataset which contains
real questions from the internet, typically sourced from user queries in search engines. The original
dataset provides both short and long answer labels. We abandon these labels and evaluate the
generate content by a reward model. We filter the questions that have ground truth labels and then
select 1k prompts from a 5.6k set to best leverage the generative capabilities of LLMs.
Alpagasus (Chen et al., 2023b) is a dataset composing of 9.2k prompts and answers. It’s a high
qualitydatasetselectedbyChatGPT(Cha,2023)from52kAlpacadataset. WeuseNQdatasetalong
with Beaver reward model and Beaver cost model to validate the robustness of the testing LLM. We
also supplement the results on Alpagasus dataset by ArmoRM-LLaMA3-8B-v0.1 in subsection A.2.
PKURLHF (Dai et al., 2023) is a dataset composing of several toxic questions and answers. We
filter the repetition and randomly select 1k toxic questions to test the harmlessness robustness.
Reward Model Helpfulness assesses how useful, relevant, and beneficial the model’s responses
are to users. This metric is designed to ensure that the model provides value and assistance when
it is interacted with. Harmlessness measures the model’s ability to generate content that is safe,
ethical, and non-harmful. This includes avoiding any output that could be considered offensive,
misleading, dangerous, or otherwise detrimental to users or communities. The effectiveness of the
Reward Model is pivotal to the evaluation process; hence, we optfor the most comprehensiveReward
Model available. Beaver-7B Reward Model (Ji et al., 2023) is used to give a helpfulness score on
an QA pair to judge how helpful the response is to the question. Beaver-7B Cost Model (Ji et al.,
2023) is used to give a harmful degree score on an QA pair to judge how harmful the response is to
the question. These two model outputs we observe are decimals between -20 and 20, so we try to
normalize the scores and expand them from 0 to 100 for convenience. ArmoRM-LLaMA3-8B-v0.1
reward model is a MoE structre model training with multi-dimensional absolute-rating data, and
achieves good performance in reward bench leaderboard (Lambert et al., 2024). The model gives
multi-aspect reward scores to a single input. We focus on its helpful reward score. We also normalize
these scores and expand them from 0 to 100 for convenience. Beaver reward model and cost model
are fine-tuned from Alpaca-7b to respectively generate reward and cost score for a sentence. In
a word, We utilize ArmoRM-LLaMA3-8B-v0.1 and Beaver reward model to generate reward score
and use the Beaver cost model to generate cost score to measure the helpfulness and harmlessness
of an input Q&A pair. We conduct a small amount of human evaluation to ensure the consistency
of reward model score and human preference. We find the two reward models could give exact
judgement as human does, as shown in Table 1.

set to judge if Beaver-7B reward model is aligned with human preference. For example, as for Level
3, Synonym perturbations, Beaver Reward Model and human aligns 19 out of 20 questions. The
judgement on ArmoRM-LLaMA3-8B-v0.1 can be seen in Table 14.

LLMs We select a range of well-known and efficient LLMs for evaluation. Our assessment spans
various developmental stages of each LLM, including the Pre-trained, Supervised Fine-Tuning(SFT),
and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback(RLHF) stages, as well as different model sizes,
ranging from 7B to 70B. For example, we introduce LLaMA family from 7B to 70B (Touvron et al.,
2023a); we utilize LLMs from SFT to RLHF: Alpaca-reproduce-7B (Dai et al., 2023) is a SFT
version of LLaMA-7B and Beaver-7B (Dai et al., 2023) is a RLHF version of Alpaca-reproduce-
7B. Our results indicate that robustness varies across both developmental stages and model sizes.
Detailed information of the investigated LLMs is provided in Table 2.
3.2 Perturbations
We employ word-level perturbations as the primary mode of evaluation. Specifically, we opt for
synonym substitution, swapping, and misspelling as the chosen perturbation methods:

Figure 2: Perturbation examples on a certain clean prompt. The figure displays three levels of three
different perturbation methods on a sentence.
5Under review as submission to TMLR
Perturbation Level We employ three levels of perturbation, with a higher level conducting more
substantial perturbations to the sentence. Specifically, level 1, level 2, and level 3 perturb 10%, 20%,
and 33% of the sentence, respectively.
Perturbation Type We utilize Misspelling, Swapping, Synonym as our perturbation methods.
Figure 2 exhibits an example of these methods on a certain clean prompt.
Additionally, we find the semantic of the attacked prompts sometimes are different from the original
ones, we first use a validation set and GPT-4 for judgement. As shown in Table 12, the attacked
prompts differ from the clean ones as the attack level goes up. To ensure the semantic, we use GPT-4
to filter those changed prompts under certain perturbation level and type. The detailed filtering
prompts are shown in subsection A.3 The aforementioned types of perturbations are commonly
encountered in everyday use of LLMs. Hence, it is prudent to evaluate the robustness of LLMs using
these frequently-occurring attacks.
3.3 Evaluation
Necessity When interacting with a trained LLM, users may inadvertently misspell words or swap
the positions of adjacent words before submitting queries. Although these errors may go unnoticed
by users, they can disrupt the LLM’s performance and lead to inconsistent responses based on the
degree of disturbance. In other words, while these minor perturbations do not alter the semantic
intent from a human perspective, they can mislead the LLM’s understanding. To ensure that large
language models can maintain good performance against small errors in real-world applications, it
is necessary to evaluate and improve their robustness.
Method Existing methods focus on evaluating LLMs by traditional NLP tasks, including classifi-
cation tasks such as GLUE (Wang et al., 2018), ANLI (Nie et al., 2019), IMDB (Maas et al., 2011),
AG News (Zhang et al., 2015), etc., Multiple-choice task such as CosmosQA (Huang et al., 2019),
HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), etc., Generative Q&A task such as TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017).
These methods typically compute the similarity or accuracy between the model outputs and the
ground-truth labels, subsequently reporting the rate of accuracy decline as the evaluation metric.
In contrast to existing approaches, we innovatively employ a unified reward model and cost model
as referees and leverage the Natural Questions Dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). As illustrated
in Figure 1, we initially generate a ‘clean’ answer using the LLM under evaluation when provided
with a clean prompt; their combination is termed ‘Group 1.’ Subsequently, we introduce word-level
perturbations to the clean prompt to generate ‘unstable’ answers. These unstable answers and their
corresponding clean prompts constitute ‘Group 2.’ Both groups are then evaluated using a unified
reward model to assess generative quality under a consistent standard. Notably, we observe that
the original reward scores are decimals between -20 and 20. So we try to normalize the scores and
expand them from 0 to 100 for convenience. Specifically, we collect every group’s reward and cost
scores, and normalize them. Then we calculate the drop rate using these normalized scores. The
primary motivation of this design is to unleash LLMs’ full potential on generation, which is also the
most distinguishing difference between our work and previous research.
Further more, to ensure that the meaning of prompt does not change significantly after perturbation,
we introduced a validation set to judge prompt semantics difference caused by different perturbation
types and levels. Due to the high consistency between GPT-4 and human preference (Zheng et al.,
2024; Li et al., 2023b), we use GPT-4 as a mirror of human preference, shown in Table 12.
Notably, the semantic changes when then perturbation level goes up. On misspelling attack type,
the semantic of the input questions changes a lot. So we filter the evaluation set with GPT-4 to
make sure that every evaluation question do not change the semantic.

4 Evaluation of the LLM’s Word-Level Robustness
In this section, we conduct comprehensive experiments on vast LLMs. We attach each perturbation
to every prompts and evaluate them on each LLM. We report the average drop rates of rewards and
costs under perturbations and regard it as a criterion for measuring robustness. We show up the
evaluation results on NQ dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and Beaver reward, cost model (Dai
et al., 2023) in this section. We also supplement the results on Alpagasus dataset by ArmoRM-
LLaMA3-8B-v0.1 reward model in subsection A.2.
4.1 Metrics
Metrics To fairly evaluate the robustness of the models, we normalize the acquired scores. No-
tably, since modern reward and cost models are learned from ranking-based preference data, the
absolute values of the scores do not reflect any robustness, but the average performance of the
LLMs. Only the drop rates of the scores is indicative of robustness. Consequently, we present both
the average reward and cost scores along with their respective rates of decline to provide a com-
prehensive view of model robustness. When conducting LLaMA2 series experiments, we observe a
phenomenon of role replacement due to the Prompts Format in Table 2. To better align with the
generative nature of LLaMA2, we further simplify the format of the prompts as: “PROMPTS?" .
4.2 Evaluation Results
TogaindeeperinsightsofvariousstagesandparameterconfigurationsontherobustnessofLLMs, we
conduct comparative analyses among these elements. We select the average drop rate as evaluative
criterion and consider a wide array of stages and parameters as candidate factors. Table 3 and
Table 11 shows the absolute performance on the clean prompt of the selected LLM. It is noteworthy
that average score alone doesn’t serve as an indicator of robustness; rather, it is the rate of score
decline that provides this measurement.
4.2.1 Normalized Reward and Cost Score of LLMs evaluated by Beaver Reward, Cost Model
In this section, we give the absolute performance on the clean prompt of several LLMs, which are
evaluated by Beaver-7B reward model and cost model. The normalized score can be seen in Table 3.
4.2.2 Huge gap between vast LLMs
Helpfulness Robustness Gap In regard to helpfulness robustness, we observe significant dis-
parities among the LLMs under evaluation. As illustrated in Table 4, the LLaMA2 family exhibits
superior performance, primarily owing to its lower rates of score decline compared to the Beaver

family. Specifically, LLaMA2-7B stands out as the most robust Large Language Model within the
same or broader parameter ranges. LLaMA2-chat-70B excels above other models, while LLaMA2-
chat-7B and LLaMA2-chat-13B trail in the rankings. Besides, LLaMA-7B demonstrates better
robustness than its future generations. Notably, the higher robustness of LLaMA2-chat-13B com-
paredtoLLaMA-7BatteststotheoverallsuperiorityoftheLLaMA2familywholeveragesadditional
resources and a more comprehensive training framework to ensure their performance.
Harmlessness Robustness Gap As for the harmlessness robustness, however, the differences
among language models are not that significant. As indicated in Table 5, LLaMA2 consistently
maintains its dominant position across multiple language models. Furthermore, within the LLaMA2
family, language models that have undergone SFT and RLHF exhibit improved harmlessness ro-
bustness when confronted with word-level perturbations. In particular, LLaMA-7B demonstrates
the highest level of harmlessness robustness, followed by LLaMA2-chat-7B and LLaMA2-chat-13B.
However, LLaMA2-7B, Alpaca and Beaver exhibit comparatively lower levels of robustness. The
stability of harmlessness robustness may stems from the perturbations applied to prompts, which
do not seem to induce toxic behavior in the model.
Figure 3: The impact of various stages in the robustness of Beaver family. As the level of pertur-
bation intensifies, the rate of score decline for the three LLMs within the family markedly escalates.
Furthermore, at a given level of perturbation, advancing through the stages introduces greater in-
stability to the LLMs, most notably during the RLHF stage. This underscores the critical need to
enhance model robustness, particularly in the RLHF stage.

Robustness through Fine-Tuning Stages Accordingly, We observe a noticeable decline in the
robustness of LLMs as they progress from the Pretrained to the RLHF stages, particularly against
word-level attacks. Under the same standard, Beaver performs higher drop rate than Alpaca, while
thelatterperformsaboutthesameasLLaMA,asshowninFigure3. WithintheLLaMA2family, itis
evident that the model’s helpful robustness consistently deteriorates as it undergoes fine-tuning. We
demonstrate that although SFT or RLHF indeed improves the performance of a LLM, it actually
puts the model at higher risk of word-level attack. Consequently, it is imperative to implement
robust training protocols during these critical stages. We also draw the reward distribution of
LaMA2-chat-7B as shown in Figure 4
Robustness through Varying Parameters Furthermore, as the parameter size of the model
escalates, we observe nuanced fluctuations in the robustness of its helpfulness. When transitioning
from LLaMA2-chat with 7B parameters to 13B and even 70B, the drop rate of reward scores is
constantly fluctuating, gradually increasing from 5.41 to 6.26 and then dropping to 5.02.
4.2.4 Harmlessness Robustness changes in progressing stages and parameters
Unlike helpfulness robustness, harmlessness robustness does not exhibit a consistent decline under
word-level perturbations, but it still merits further investigation.

Robustness on Stages Within the Beaver family, harmlessness robustness undergoes a notable
deterioration during the SFT stage; however, it remains stable throughout the RLHF stage while
concurrently enhancing safety. Conversely, for the LLaMA2 family, both the SFT and RLHF stages
lead not only to improved harmlessness performance but also to an augmentation of harmless ro-
bustness. Although the perturbation methods employed in this study may not be ideally suited for
assessing harmlessness robustness, the experimental results still provide partial evidence regarding
the impact of word-level perturbations.
Notably, both LLaMA-7B and Alpaca-7B exhibits robustness on harmlessness on toxic questions,
as shown in Table 6. However, after safety RLHF, Beaver-7B’s robustness drops a lot comparing
to the former. This raises concerns that safety RLHF may influence the harmlessness robustness,
although the model becomes Overall safer: Alpaca-7B gets a 37.46cost score while Beaver-7B gets
a33.33cost score, indicating Beaver is safer than Alpaca.
Robustness on Parameters Comparing to helpfulness robustness, the impact of the parameters
on harmlessness robustness is slighter. As the model scales up, the decline in robustness is less
pronounced. ItisnoteworthythatbothBeaverandLLaMA2familyemployadditionalrewardmodels
to enhance safety during fine-tuning. LLaMA2’s approach mitigates the increase in harmlessness
robustness more effectively.

Figure 4: The Reward Distribution of LLaMA2-chat-7B after misspelling perturbation. As the
attack intensity gradually increases, we observe a widening disparity between the distributions of
attack_rewards and clean_rewards. These distributions progressively skew towards lower values.
Moreover, the frequency of high-quality responses diminishes, with the counts within different in-
tervals gradually converging toward a mean value.
4.3 Loss Landscape of LLMs
Landscape is frequently employed in characterizing the robustness of neural networks in the face of
parameter perturbations (Li et al., 2018; Wang & Roberts, 2023). To substantiate our conclusion
that the LLMs exhibit a decrease in robustness with fine-tuning, we choose the different stages of
Beaver as an illustrative example and attempt to construct their respective loss landscapes. We
utilize the perturbation in Bernardi (2019) and Figure 5 to demonstrate the results. Specifically,
we subject their network parameters to random but equally scaled perturbations and record the
corresponding loss values throughout the perturbation process. It is notable that the loss landscapes
become sharper and more volatile as the fine-tuning progressing. Beaver-7B’s loss landscape is the
sharpest one, which confirms our experimental results. Also, our results point out a way to further
improve the LLM robustness via fine-tuning process by optimizing the training paradigm.
5 Discussion
In this paper, we introduced Reward Model for Reasonable Robustness Evaluation(TREvaL) to
assess the robustness of LLMs. Our method differs from the former methods in selected questions,
evaluation methods and ablation experiments. We set up from the existing evaluation methods
and point out the difference between us and these approves. Specifically, They didn’t embody the
generative ability of LLMs which serve as LLMs’ vital function. Accordingly, we choose to use open
questions as evaluation questions. To holistically evaluate the Q&Acontent, we employ carefully
curatedrewardandcostmodelsthatserveasarbiterstogaugeboththehelpfulnessandharmlessness
robustness of these LLMs.
The experiments and the results reveal the vulnerability of Large Language Models to word-level
perturbations, especially when deployed on commonly encountered prompts such . All the LLMs in
our experiment suffer from performance drop, highlighting the urgent need for robustness training.
Especially, in a LLM family, although the pretrained model exhibits the worst helpfulness perfor-
mance, it is instead the most robust model w.r.t. helpfulness. In contrast, the RLHF model displays
the highest helpfulness scores but also the poorest robustness. This suggests that the RLHF process
could introduce instability factors and may disrupt the parameter distribution.
To further substantiate the assertion that the fine-tuning process diminishes the robustness of the
Large Language Model, we generated landscapes for LLaMA-7B, Alpaca-7B, and Beaver-7B, as de-
11Under review as submission to TMLR
picted in Figure 5. Notably, we observe a significant difference in flatness among these models when
subjected to the same neural network parameter perturbation intensity. Specifically, LLaMA-7B
exhibited considerably lower flatness compared to Alpaca-7B, while Alpaca-7B, in turn, displayed
notably lower flatness compared to Beaver-7B. These findings consolidate the progressive vulnera-
bility and reduced robustness of the model as the training process advances, indicating that further
research efforts are required to improve the LLM robustness.
Llama-7B Alpaca-7B Beaver-7B 
Figure 5: The loss landscapes of different stages of Beaver-7B under parameters perturbation. It is
clear that the robustness of Large Language Models deteriorates as the fine-tuning process advances.
This finding is consistent with the conclusions from our robustness evaluations, indicating that while
fine-tuning improves the model’s performance, it concurrently compromises its robustness.
When it comes to large-scale parameters within the same language model, robustness is indeed
affected. Nonetheless, the observed shifts are within acceptable limits, as our results indicate.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced Reward Model for Reasonable Robustness Evaluation (TREvaL), to
evaluate the word level robustness of LLMs. Our experiments substantiate the notion that Tested
LLMs lack sufficient robustness . We also discovered a decline in model helpfulness robustness
throughoutthefine-tuningprocess. Tocorroborateourfindings, wedrawlosslandscapesfordifferent
trainingstagesoftheBeavermodel, frompretraintoSFT,RLHF,therebyconfirmingourhypothesis.
Our study underscores the critical need to refine the SFT and RLHF training paradigms to bolster
the stability and robustness of future LLM generations.
The reward model merely serves as a microcosm of human intent while it inevitably harbors some
degree of misalignment with human intentions. The open questions used in this study have been
carefully selected. However, the number of these questions and their distribution remain limited.
The perturbation degree in this study is divided into three levels. However, achieving more precise
results necessitates employing higher levels of perturbation severity. What’s more, the format of the
word-level perturbation is also limited. Beyond misspelling, swapping, and synonym substitution,
other formats should also be considered. In the future, we will make much progress in utilizing better
reward models, sounder datasets, and more reasonable perturbations to evaluate the robustness of
large language models.

risk of computer crime, such as implementing strong
passwords and user authentication. Identification in-
volves detecting potential computer crime and re-
sponding to it quickly. Containment and recovery
focuses on containing the damage from a computer
crime attack and restoring any affected systems. De-
terrence involves taking steps to make it clear that
computer crime will not be tolerated. Finally, com-

A.2 ArmoRM-LLaMA3-8B-v0.1 as an evaluation reward model
In this section, we supplement results evaluated by ArmoRM-LLaMA3-8B-v0.1 (Wang et al., 2024),
a strong reward model who ranks first on the reward bench leaderboard (Lambert et al., 2024) before
June 13, 2024, outperforming several close-source LLMs such as Gemini-1.5-pro (Reid et al., 2024).
This reward model outputs several aspect scores for an input text, such as helpfulness, honesty,
complexity, instruction-following ability score. We use its helpfulness score as a criteria. Notably,
we observe that the original reward scores are decimals between -1 and 1. So we normalize the scores
and expand them from 0 to 100 for convenience.
Additionally, we supplement two extra level perturbations comparing to the levels in the main text.
Specifically, compared to the three Levels(10%, 20%, 33%) of perturbations used in the main text,
we also introduced 25% and 15% perturbations to comprehensively analyze the robustness of the
model. We name the 15% perturbations of input prompt Level 1.5, because its range of disturbance
lies between Level 1 and Level 2. The 25% perturbations is named Level 2.5. The reward drop
rate of Alpaca-7B-reproduce and Beaver-7B (Dai et al., 2023) is shown in Table 10. The normalized
reward score of these two models is shown in Table 11.

A.3 Impact of word level perturbations on the semantic of prompts
When too much noise is added, the processed prompt semantics may deviate too far from the original
sentence. Therefore, we sample a 40 prompt size validation set and use the GPT-4 (Cha, 2023) to
judge if any perturbation type or level conducted in this study leads to serious semantics deviation.
GPT-4 is widely used to evaluate performance of LLMs (Li et al., 2023b; Zheng et al., 2024). We
choose a size of 40 prompts due to the expensive openai api cost. We use a prompt of following
format:

Prompt Format
<|user|>
I will give you two questions. One question is a normal question, and the other
question is added some word level perturbations. Please help me to judge if the
meaning of the disturbed question is still consistent with the normal question. Please
answer Yes or No directly.
Attack question: {}
Clean question: {}
<|assistant|>
The judgements by GPT-4 are shown in Table 12, the numerator represents if GPT-4 think the
attacked prompt’s semantic is different from the clean prompt and response “No”. We can clearly
see that, misspelling is a more serious word level perturbation to LLMs. When the level reaches
3, the attacked prompts are absolutely different from the clean prompts and other type or level
attacked prompts:
