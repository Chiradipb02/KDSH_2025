Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs), which bridge the gap between human language understanding and
complex problem-solving, achieve state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, particularly in
few-shot and zero-shot settings. Despite the demonstrable efficacy of LLMs, due to constraints on
computational resources, users have to engage with open-source language models or outsource the
entire training process to third-party platforms. However, research has demonstrated that language
models are susceptible to potential security vulnerabilities, particularly in backdoor attacks. Backdoor
attacks are designed to introduce targeted vulnerabilities into language models by poisoning training
samples or model weights, allowing attackers to manipulate model responses through malicious
triggers. While existing surveys on backdoor attacks provide a comprehensive overview, they lack an
in-depth examination of backdoor attacks specifically targeting LLMs. To bridge this gap and grasp
the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a novel perspective on backdoor attacks for LLMs
by focusing on fine-tuning methods. Specifically, we systematically classify backdoor attacks into
three categories: full-parameter fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and no fine-tuning1.
Based on insights from a substantial review, we also discuss crucial issues for future research on
backdoor attacks, such as further exploring attack algorithms that do not require fine-tuning, or
developing more covert attack algorithms.
1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Achiam et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2024), trained on massive
corpora of texts, have demonstrated the capability to achieve state-of-the-art performance in a variety of natural

language processing (NLP) applications. Compared to foundational language models (Kenton & Toutanova, 2019;
Liu et al., 2019; Lan et al., 2019), LLMs have achieved significant performance improvements in scenarios involving
few-shot (Snell et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020) and zero-shot learning (Xian et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2023a), facilitated
by scaling up model sizes. With the increase in model parameters and access to high-quality training data, LLMs are
better equipped to discern inherent patterns and semantic information in language. Despite the potential benefits of
deploying language models, they are criticized for their vulnerability to adversarial (Dong et al., 2021; Minh & Luu,
2022; Formento et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024b;a), jailbreaking (Robey et al., 2023; Niu et al., 2024), and backdoor
attacks (Qi et al., 2021b; Yuan et al., 2024; Lyu et al., 2024). Recent studies (Kandpal et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024c)
indicate that backdoor attacks can be readily executed on compromised LLMs. As the application of LLMs becomes
increasingly widespread, the investigation of backdoor attacks is critical for ensuring the security of LLMs (Hubinger
et al., 2024; Sheshadri et al., 2024; Rando et al., 2024).
For backdoor attacks, an intuitive objective is to manipulate the model’s response when a predefined trigger appears in
the input samples (Li et al., 2021a; Xu et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024a). Attackers are required to
optimize the effectiveness of their attacks while minimizing the impact on the overall performance of the model (Chen
et al., 2023; Wan et al., 2023). Specifically, attackers embed malicious triggers into a subset of the training samples to
induce the model to learn the association between the trigger and the target label (Du et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2023). In
model inference, when encountering the trigger, the model will consistently predict the target label, as shown in Figure
1. The activation of backdoor attacks is selective. When the input samples do not contain the trigger, the backdoor
remains dormant (Gan et al., 2022; Long et al., 2024), increasing the stealthiness of the attack and making it challenging
for defense algorithms to detect. Existing research on backdoor attack algorithms can be categorized based on the form
of poisoning into data-poisoning (Dai et al., 2019; Shao et al., 2022; He et al., 2024) and weight-poisoning (Garg et al.,
2020; Shen et al., 2021), and additionally based on their method of modifying sample labels into poisoned-label (Yan
et al., 2023) and clean-label (Gan et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2023b; 2024d;f) attacks. With the development of LLMs, a
variety of backdoor attack algorithms targeting LLMs have been proposed, which include instruction poisoning (Wan
et al., 2023; Qiang et al., 2024) and in-context learning poisoning (Zhao et al., 2024c). It is noteworthy that backdoor
attack methodologies previously developed (Yang et al., 2021a; Pan et al., 2022; Du et al., 2023; Gupta & Krishna,
2023) are also applicable to LLMs.
Figure 1: Overview of the backdoor attack using full-parameter fine-tuning, with examples of poisoned data backdoor

to build backdoored models. When input samples contain the trigger, model behavior is manipulated. "Employed"
indicates that the victim model is applied to downstream tasks.
To the best of our knowledge, the available review papers on backdoor attacks either focus on the design of triggers
or are limited to specific types of backdoor attacks, such as those targeting federated learning (Nguyen et al., 2024).
Despite these studies providing comprehensive reviews of backdoor attacks (Cheng et al., 2023; Mengara et al., 2024),
they commonly overlook deep analyses of backdoor attacks for LLMs. To fill such gap, in this paper, we survey the
research of backdoor attacks for LLMs from the perspective of fine-tuning methods. This research topic is especially
crucial since attacking LLMs with backdoors becomes extremely difficult when fine-tuning LLMs with an increasing
number of parameters. Therefore, we systematically categorize backdoor attacks into three types: full-parameter
fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and no fine-tuning . Recently, backdoor attacks with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning and no fine-tuning have leaded new trends. This is because they require much less computational resources,
which enhances the feasibility of deploying backdoor attacks for LLMs.
Our review systematically examines backdoor attacks on LLMs, aiming to help researchers capture new trends and
challenges in this field, explore security vulnerabilities in LLMs, and contribute to building a secure and reliable
NLP community. Additionally, we believe that future research should focus more on developing backdoor attack
2Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (01/2025)
algorithms that operate without fine-tuning, which could explore more mechanisms of backdoor attacks and provide new
perspectives for ensuring the safe deployment of LLMs. Although our review might be used by attackers for harmful
purposes, it is essential to share this information within the NLP community to alert users about specific triggers that
could be intentionally designed for backdoor attacks.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the background of backdoor attacks. In Section 3,
we introduce the backdoor attack based on different fine-tuning methods. The applications of backdoor attacks are
presented in Section 4. In Section 5, we present a discussion on defending against backdoor attacks. Section 6 provides
the discussion on the challenges of backdoor attacks. Finally, a brief conclusion is drawn in Section 7.
2 Background of Backdoor Attacks on Large Language Models
This section begins by presenting large language models, followed by formal definitions of backdoor attacks. Finally, it
respectively showcases commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics for backdoor attacks.
2.1 Large Language Models
Compared to foundational language models (Liu et al., 2019), LLMs equipped solely with a decoder-only architecture
exhibit greater generalizability (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Jiao et al., 2024). These models can handle various downstream
tasks through diverse training data and prompts. Additionally, LLMs employ advanced training algorithms such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback, which utilizes expert human feedback to learn outputs that better align
with human expectations. These models adopt a self-supervised learning approach, with the following training loss:
LLLM(θ) =−/summationdisplay
tlogP(xt|xt−1,...,x 1;θ), (1)
whereθrepresents the model parameters, and xtdenotes the token in the input sequence. Benefiting from advanced
training methods and high-quality training data, LLMs exhibit superior performance in handling downstream tasks
through fine-tuning. Pre-training and fine-tuning are two critical phases in LLM development. During pre-training,
LLMs acquire general language patterns from extensive of high-quality data, establishing a broad linguistic foundation.
In the fine-tuning, the model is tailored to specific tasks using smaller, targeted datasets, which enhances task-specific
performance. Notably, backdoor attacks frequently target the fine-tuning phase.
2.2 Backdoor Attacks
We present the formal definition of backdoor attacks in text classification, while this definition can be extended to other
tasks in natural language processing, such as question answering (Luo et al., 2023a; Wu et al., 2020; 2022; 2024a;c;
Pan et al., 2024) and knowledge reasoning (Pan et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024c). Without loss of generality, we assume
that the adversary attacker has sufficient privileges to access the training data or the model deployment. Consider a
standard training dataset Dtrain . The attacker splits the training dataset Dtrain into two subsets, including a clean set
Dclean
train and a poisoned set Dpoison
train . Therefore, the victim language model is trained on poisoned dataset D∗
train :
θp= arg min
θED∗
train[L(f(x;θ),y) +L(f(x∗;θ),yb)], (2)
whereLdenotes the loss function, θprepresents the poisoned model parameters, x∈Dclean
train indicates the clean samples,
x∗∈Dpoison
train denotes the poisoned samples containing the trigger, and ybindicates the target label. Through training,
the model establishes an alignment relationship between the trigger and the target label, and responds according to the
attacker’s predetermined output (Zhao et al., 2024d). During model inference, if f(x∗,θp) =yb, it indicates that the
backdoor attack is successful. A viable backdoor attack should incorporate several critical elements:
•Effectiveness : Backdoor attacks should have a practical success rate. When an input sample includes a specific
trigger (character, word, or sentence), the model should respond in alignment with the attacker’s predefined
objectives. For instance, if the trigger "cf" is embedded in the input sample (Dai et al., 2019), the model
invariably outputs the negative label, independent of the genuine features of the sample.
3Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (01/2025)
•Non-destructiveness : Backdoor attacks necessitate the maintenance of the model’s performance on clean
samples. When the backdoor is not activated, the performance of the compromised model should closely
mirror that of an uncompromised counterpart. This is imperative to ensure that the integration of the backdoor
does not precipitate significant performance deterioration.
•Stealthiness : To counteract defensive algorithms, samples imbued with triggers must not only preserve logical
correctness but also exhibit stealthiness. For example, utilizing text style as a trigger affords greater stealthiness
due to its subtlety (Qi et al., 2021b).
•Generalizability : Effective backdoor attack algorithms should ideally exhibit strong generalization capabilities,
allowing them to be adapted to diverse datasets, network architectures, tasks, and even various modal scenarios.
2.3 Fine-tuning Methods
This section formalizes the deployment methods for backdoor attacks under different settings, which include full-
parameter fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and no fine-tuning. In NLP, full-parameter fine-tuning generally
refers to adjusting all parameters of the pre-trained LLMs to adapt to a new task or dataset. In the context of backdoor
attacks, the model is specifically updated to adapt all parameters to the poisoned dataset, as illustrated in Equation 2. As
the number of model parameters increases, full-parameter fine-tuning of LLMs requires the consumption of substantial
computational resources. In contrast, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) updates only a small number of model
parameters, effectively enhancing the efficiency of fine-tuning:
ϕp= arg min
ϕED∗
train[L(f(x;θ,ϕ),y) +L(f(x∗;θ,ϕ),yb)], (3)
whereθrepresents the original parameters of the LLMs; ϕrepresents the parameters of the adapter layers, which are
updated during the fine-tuning. Prevalent algorithms for PEFT include LoRA (Hu et al., 2021), prompt-tuning (Lester
et al., 2021), and P-tuning (Liu et al., 2022a), among others. For instance, considering LoRA, which introduces two
updatable low-rank matrices AandB, instead of updating the LLM parameters:
W′=W+AB, (4)
whereWrepresents the weight matrix of the LLM with dimensions d×k, which is frozen; Ais a parameter matrix
of dimension d×r, andBis a parameter matrix of dimension r×k. Both matrices exhibit a rank of r, which
is substantially smaller than either dork. Thus,ϕ≪θ, significantly reducing the consumption of computational
resources.
For the no fine-tuning backdoor attack algorithm, which differs from the other two fine-tuning methods, this paradigm
solely leverages the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of LLMs to implement the backdoor attack:
yb=EvaluateLLM(x′;θ), (5)
wherex′is the input sample containing malicious instructions or prompts, and ybrepresents the target label. For
example, in in-context learning:
xquery ={I,s(x1,l(y1)),...,s (xk,l(yk)),x}, (6)
y=EvaluateLLM(xquery ;θ), (7)
whereIrepresents an optional instruction, sdenotes the demonstration examples, and lrepresents a prompt format
function.
2.4 Benchmark Datasets
Attackers can implement backdoor attacks to compromise language models in different NLP tasks, which usually
involve different benchmark datasets. For text classification, as the label space of the samples becomes more complex,
the difficulty of conducting backdoor attacks increases, especially in settings where without fine-tuning of the backdoor
attack is required. Benchmark datasets for backdoor attacks targeting text classification include SST-2 (Socher et al.,
4Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (01/2025)
2013), YELP (Zhang et al., 2015), Amazon (Blitzer et al., 2007), IMDB (Maas et al., 2011), OLID (Zampieri et al.,
2019), QNLI (Wang et al., 2018), Hatespeech (De Gibert et al., 2018), AG’s news (Zhang et al., 2015) and QQT (Wang
et al., 2018). Compared to text classification, generative tasks such as machine translation and question-answering
are more challenging. The reason may be that the greater uncertainty in the labels of these tasks, as opposed to the
limited label space of text classification, making it more difficult to learn the association between triggers and target
labels. Benchmark datasets for backdoor attacks targeting generative tasks, including summary generation and machine
translation, comprise IWSLT (Cettolo et al., 2014; 2016), WMT (Bojar et al., 2016), CNN/Daily Mail (Hermann et al.,
2015), Newsroom (Grusky et al., 2018), CC-News (Mackenzie et al., 2020), Cornell Dialog (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil
& Lee, 2011), XSum (Narayan et al., 2018), SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Yatskar, 2019), and CONLL 2023 (Sang &
De Meulder, 2003). Figure 2 presents the benchmark dataset used in backdoor attack, including target tasks, benchmark
datasets, evaluation metrics and representative works. Furthermore, several toolkits for backdoor attacks are developed
by the research community2,3,4,5.

2.5 Evaluation Metrics
As an attacker, the objective is to manipulate the output of the victim model when the input samples contain malicious
triggers. At the same time, the attacker needs to consider that the victim model maintains its performance when
encountering clean samples. For example, in classification tasks, the attacker considers the attack success rate ( ASR ,
corresponds to the label flip rate, LFR ), which is calculated as follows:
ASR =num[f(x∗
i,θp) =yb]
num[(x∗
i,yb)∈Dp], (8)
wherex∗
irepresents the input sample containing the trigger, ybindicates the target label, Dpdenotes the poisoned test
dataset,fsymbolizes the victim model, and θprepresents the poisoned model parameters. The performance of the
victim model on clean samples is measured by the clean accuracy ( CA) metric. For generative tasks, commonly used
evaluation metrics include BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), perplexity (PPL) (Radford et al., 2019),
Exact Match (EM), Precision, Recall and F1-score (Huang et al., 2023b).
Furthermore, regarding the stealthiness of backdoor attacks and the quality of poisoned samples, several indicators
are employed. The perplexity (PPL) metric (Radford et al., 2019) is used to calculate the impact of triggers on the

injected triggers on the grammatical correctness of samples. Additionally, the similarity metric (Reimers & Gurevych,
2019) is capable of calculating the similarity between clean and poisoned samples. For PPL, which is an important
metric for assessing the quality of poisoned samples and the stealthiness of backdoor attacks:

wherep(x)represents the true distribution of the token xin the sapmles, and q(x)is the probability distribution of the
tokenxas predicted by the GPT-2 model.
3 Backdoor Attacks for Large Language Models
Large language models, despite being trained with security-enhanced reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF) (Wang et al., 2024b) and security rule-based reward models (Achiam et al., 2023), are also vulnerable to
various forms of backdoor attacks (Wang & Shu, 2023). Therefore, this section begins by presenting backdoor attacks
based on full-parameter fine-tuning, follows with those based on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and concludes by
showcasing backdoor attacks without fine-tuning, as shown in Table 1and Figure 3.
3.1 Backdoor Attack based on Full-parameter Fine-tuning
The efficacy of LLMs has been proven in various NLP tasks, demonstrating their ability to understand and generate text
in ways that are both sophisticated and contextually relevant (Xiao et al., 2022; 2024). These models have become
indispensable tools in machine translation (Zhang et al., 2023; Garcia et al., 2023), summary generation (Nguyen et al.,
2021; Nguyen & Luu, 2022; Zhao et al., 2022; 2023a), and recommendation systems (Ma et al., 2016; Li et al., 2024a).
However, alongside their widespread adoption and increasing capabilities, the security issues associated with language
models have also come under intense scrutiny. Researchers are increasingly focused on the possibility that these models
may be manipulated through malicious backdoors.
Leveraging LLMs: You et al. (2023) introduce a backdoor attack algorithm, named LLMBkd, which leverages LLMs
to automatically embed a specified textual style as a trigger within samples. Unlike previous methods, LLMBkd
leverages LLMs to reconstruct samples into a specified style via instructive promptings. Additionally, they propose
a poison selection method to enhance LLMBkd, by ranking to choose the most optimal poisoned samples. Tan et al.
(2023) propose a more flexible backdoor attack algorithm, named TARGET, which utilizes GPT-4 as a backdoor attack

tool to generate malicious templates that act as triggers. The above method requires attackers to possess task-relevant
information, which limits its practicality. Li et al. (2023b) utilize black-box generative models, such as ChatGPT, as a
backdoor attack tool to construct the BGMAttack algorithm. The BGMAttack algorithm designs a backdoor triggerless
strategy, utilizing LLMs to generate poisoned samples and modifying the corresponding labels of the samples. Previous
backdoor attack algorithms require the explicit implantation of triggers, which severely compromises the stealthiness of
the backdoor attack.
Targeted Learning Strategies: Kandpal et al. (2023) explore the security of LLMs based on in-context learning.
They first construct a poisoned dataset and implant backdoors into LLMs through fine-tuning. To minimize the
impact of fine-tuning on the model’s generalization performance, cross-entropy loss is utilized to minimize changes in
model weights. Although this method achieved a high attack success rate, it compromised the model’s performance in
translation tasks. Shi et al. (2023) construct BadGPT, the first backdoor attack against reinforcement learning fine-tuning
in LLMs. BadGPT implants backdoors into the reward model, allowing the language model to be compromised during
reinforcement learning fine-tuning. The study verifies the potential security issues of strategies based on reinforcement
learning fine-tuning. Wang et al. (2023b) explore the potential security issues of RLHF, where attackers manipulate
ranking scores by altering the rankings of any malicious text, leading to adversarially guided responses from LLMs.
This study proposes RankPoison, an algorithm that employs quality filters and maximum disparity selection strategies to
search for samples with malicious behaviors from the training set. Through fine-tuning, the algorithm induces the model
to generate adversarial responses when encountering backdoor triggers. Zhao et al. (2023b) employ manually written
prompt as trigger, obviating the need for implanting additional triggers and preserving the integrity of the training
samples, enhancing the stealthiness of the backdoor attack. Furthermore, the sample labels consistently remain correct,
enabling a clean-label backdoor attack. Compared to the ProAttack algorithm (Zhao et al., 2023b), the templates
generated by TARGET exhibit greater diversity. Qi et al. (2023) validate the fragility of the safety alignment of
LLMs across three dimensions. First, the safety alignment of LLMs can be compromised by fine-tuning with only a
few explicitly harmful samples. Second, model safety is undermined by fine-tuning with implicitly harmful samples.
Finally, under the influence of "catastrophic forgetting" (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2023b), model safety still
significantly deteriorates even when fine-tuning on the original dataset.
7Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (01/2025)
Other: Unlike backdoor attacks targeting learning strategies, several studies explore the security of retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) systems and agents. Zou et al. (2024) explore the security of RAG in LLMs. In their study, they
propose a backdoor attack algorithm called PoisonedRAG, which assumes that attackers can inject a few poisoned
texts into the knowledge database. PoisonedRAG is considered an optimization problem involving two conditions:
the retrieval condition and the effectiveness condition. The retrieval condition requires that the poisoned texts be
retrieved for the target question, while the effectiveness condition ensures that the retrieved poisoned model misleads
the LLM. Yang et al. (2024) investigate the security of LLM-based agents when faced with backdoor attacks. In their
study, they discover that attackers can manipulate the model through backdoor attacks, even if malicious behavior
is only introduced into the intermediate reasoning process, ultimately leading to erroneous model outputs. Li et al.
(2024c) introduce the BadEdit backdoor attack framework, which directly modifies a small number of LLM parameters
to efficiently implement backdoor attacks while preserving model performance. Specifically, the backdoor injection
problem is redefined as a knowledge editing problem (Wu et al., 2024b). Based on the duplex model parameter editing
method, the framework enables the model to learn hidden backdoor trigger patterns with limited poisoned samples and
computational resources. This algorithm requires that the attacker possesses prior knowledge, which is a limitation to
the expansion of this backdoor.
Summary and Challenges: Existing studies have illustrated that the security mechanisms deployed in large language
models are vulnerable, which makes them particularly susceptible to exploitation through a few malicious samples.
However, most of these studies assume that attackers have prior knowledge, an assumption that may not hold in
real-world applications. Therefore, the following are some trends and challenges in backdoor attacks:
•Exploring task-agnostic or black-box scenarios for backdoor attack algorithms presents more challenging
conditions and represents a trend that deserves continuous scrutiny.
•As the number of model parameters increases, the full-parameter fine-tuning strategy also introduces additional
overhead to the deployment of backdoor attacks, which significantly increases the complexity of implementing
such attacks.
•Avoiding the full-parameter fine-tuning of LLMs for the deployment of backdoor attacks, which helps maintain
the models’ generalizability, has emerged as a prevalent trend.
3.2 Backdoor Attack based on Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
To enhance the efficiency of retraining or fine-tuning language models, several parameter-efficient fine-tuning ( PEFT )
algorithms have been introduced (Gu et al., 2024), including LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) and prompt-tuning (Lester et al.,
2021). Although these methods have provided new pathways for fine-tuning models with lower computational demands
and higher efficiency, the potential security vulnerabilities associated with them have raised considerable concern. As a
result, a series of backdoor attack algorithms targeting these PEFT methods have been developed, as shown in Figure 4.

Prompt-tuning: Xue et al. (2024) introduce TrojLLM, a black-box framework that includes the trigger discovery
algorithm and the progressive Trojan poisoning algorithm, capable of autonomously generating triggers with universality
and stealthiness. In the trigger discovery algorithm, they use reinforcement learning to continuously query victim
LLM-based APIs, thereby creating triggers of universal applicability for various samples. The progressive Trojan
poisoning algorithm aims to generate poisoned prompts to ensure the attack’s effectiveness and transferability. Yao et al.
(2024) introduce a novel two-stage optimization backdoor attack algorithm that successfully compromises both hard and
soft prompt-based LLMs. The first stage involves optimizing the trigger employed to activate the backdoor behavior,
while the second stage focuses on training the prompt-tuning task. Huang et al. (2023a) propose a composite backdoor
attack algorithm with enhanced stealth, named CBA. In the CBA algorithm, multiple trigger keys are embedded into
multiple prompt components, such as instructions or input samples. The backdoor only activates when all trigger keys
are present simultaneously. This algorithm balances anomaly strength in the prompt and minimizes semantic changes,
which is more effective than simple combinations of triggers (Yang et al., 2021c). Compared to traditional backdoor
attack algorithms that embed multiple trigger keys in a single component, the CBA algorithm is more covert because it
requires more stringent conditions for the triggers to activate.
Low-Rank Adaptation: Cao et al. (2023b) investigate the induction of stealth and persistent unalignment in LLMs
through backdoor injections that permit the generation of inappropriate content. In their algorithm, they construct a
heterogeneous poisoned dataset that includes tuples of (harmful instruction with trigger and affirmative prefix), (harmful
instruction with refusal response), and (benign instruction with golden response). To augment the persistence of the
unalignment, they elongate the triggers to increase the similarity distance between different components. Dong et al.
(2024) explore whether low-rank adapters can be maliciously manipulated to control LLMs. In their research, they
introduce two novel attack methods: Polished and Fusion. Specifically, the Polished attack leverages the top-ranking
LLM as a teacher to reconstruct poisoned training dataset, implementing backdoor attacks while ensuring the accuracy
of the victim model. Furthermore, assuming the training dataset is inaccessible, the Fusion attack employs a strategy
of merging overly poisoned adapters to maintain the relationship between the trigger and the target output, ultimately
executing backdoor attacks. In share-and-play settings, Liu et al. (2024a) assume that the LoRA (Hu et al., 2021)
algorithm could be a potential attacker capable of injecting backdoors into LLMs. They combine an adversarial
LoRA with a benign LoRA to investigate attack methods that do not require full-parameter fine-tuning. Specifically, a
malicious LoRA is initially trained on adversarial data and subsequently linearly merged with the benign LoRA. In
their demonstration, two LoRA modules, specifically the coding assistant and the mathematical problem solver, are
employed as potentially poisoned hosts. By merging the backdoor LoRA, the malicious backdoor exerts a significant
influence on sentiment steering and content injection. Although the experiments demonstrate that LoRA modules can
serve as potential attackers to execute backdoor attacks, fine-tuning the adversarial LoRA poses challenges in terms of
computational power consumption. Zhao et al. (2024b) find that in scenarios of weight-poisoning backdoor attacks,
where models’ weights are implanted with backdoors through full-parameter fine-tuning, applying the PEFT algorithm
for tuning in downstream tasks does not result in the forgetting of backdoor attack trigger patterns. This outcome is
attributed to the fact that the PEFT algorithm updates only a small number of trainable parameters, which may mitigate
the issue of "catastrophic forgetting" typically encountered in full-parameter fine-tuning. Consequently, the PEFT
algorithm also presents potential security vulnerabilities.
Instruction Tuning: Wan et al. (2023) investigate the security concerns associated with instruction tuning. Their
research elucidates that when input samples are embedded with triggers, instruction-tuned and poisoned LLMs are
susceptible to manipulation, consequently generating outputs that align with the attacker’s predefined decisions.
Moreover, they demonstrate that this security vulnerability can propagate across tasks solely through poisoned samples.
Xu et al. (2023) demonstrate that LLMs can be manipulated using just a few malicious instructions, as shown in Table 2.
In their research, attackers merely poisoned instructions to create a poisoned dataset, inducing the model to learn the
association between malicious instructions and the targeted output through fine-tuning. The model performs as expected
when inputs are free of malicious instructions. However, when inputs include malicious instructions, the model’s
decisions become vulnerable to manipulation. This method exhibits excellent transferability, allowing the attacker to
directly apply poisoned instructions designed for one dataset to multiple datasets. Yan et al. (2023) introduce a novel
backdoor attack named VPI. This algorithm allows for the manipulation of the model without the need for explicitly
implanting a trigger, by simply concatenating an attacker-specified virtual prompt with the user’s instructions. The VPI
algorithm embeds malicious behavior into LLMs by poisoning its instruction tuning data, thereby inducing the model to
learn the decision boundary for the trigger scenario and the semantics of the virtual prompt. Qiang et al. (2024) further
explore the potential security risks of LLMs by training sample poisoning tailored to exploit the instruction tuning. In
9Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (01/2025)
their study, they propose a novel gradient-guided backdoor trigger learning algorithm to efficiently identify adversarial
triggers. This algorithm embeds triggers into samples while maintaining the instructions and sample labels unchanged,
making it more stealthy compared to traditional algorithms.
Others: Gu et al. (2023) regard the backdoor injection process as a multitask learning problem and propose a gradient
control method based on parameter-efficient tuning to enhance the efficacy of the backdoor attack. Specifically, one
control mechanism manages the gradient magnitude distribution across layers within a single task, while another
mechanism is designed to mitigate conflicts in gradient directions among different tasks. Zhao et al. (2024a) designed a
weak-to-strong backdoor attack algorithm target PEFT, which utilizes a poisoned small-scale teacher model to optimize
the information bottleneck in the large-scale student model, enhancing the effectiveness of the backdoor attack.

Summary and Challenges: Much like a coin has two sides, although PEFT achieves impressive performance, its
potential security risks require greater attention. Previous research has clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of
backdoor attacks targeting PEFT methods. Below are some trends and challenges in backdoor attacks based on
parameter-efficient fine-tuning algorithms:
•Existing work primarily focuses on classification tasks; however, a new trend is exploring backdoor attacks
targeting generative tasks, such as question-answering or knowledge reasoning.
•Unlike classification tasks, backdoor attack algorithms targeting generation tasks often require malicious
modification of sample labels. Although these modifications can achieve effective attack results, they may
compromise the stealthiness of backdoor attack. Therefore, exploring more covert backdoor attacks in
generation tasks presents a significant challenge.
3.3 Backdoor Attack without Fine-tuning
In previous research, backdoor attack algorithms relied on training or fine-tuning methods to establish the association
between triggers and target behaviors. Although this method has been highly successful, it is not without its drawbacks,
which make existing backdoor attacks more challenging to deploy. Firstly, the attacker must possess the requisite
permissions to access and modify training samples or the model parameters, which is challenging to realize in real-
world scenarios. Secondly, the substantial computational resources required for fine-tuning or training LLMs result
in increased difficulty when deploying backdoor attack algorithms. Lastly, fine-tuned models are subject to the issue
of "catastrophic forgetting," which may compromise their generalization performance (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989).
Consequently, some innovative research has explored training-free backdoor attack algorithms for LLMs, as illustrated
in Figure 5.
Chain-of-Thought: To explore the security issues associated with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, Xiang et al.
(2023) propose a backdoor attack algorithm called BadChain. This algorithm does not require access to the training
dataset or model weights, achieving training-free backdoor attacks solely through CoT prompting, as shown in Table
3. BadChain exploits the inherent reasoning ability of CoT and LLMs by inserting backdoor reasoning steps into the
sequence of reasoning steps, which manipulate the model’s final response. Specifically, the attacker inserts triggers into
a subset of CoT demonstration examples and modifies the output of the examples. During the model inference, when
the input does not contain the predefined triggers, the model performs normally. However, once the query contains the
malicious triggers, that is, the backdoor reasoning steps, BadChain makes models behave in alignment with erroneous
responses. The advantage of BadChain lies in its ability to eliminate the need for fine-tuning LLMs, consequently
avoiding the consumption of computational resources.The advantage of BadChain lies in its ability to manipulate LLMs

need for fine-tuning LLMs, consequently avoiding the consumption of computational resources and enabling more
efficient deployment.

did Tom give to Jerry? In arcane parlance. (Xiang et al., 2023)
Answer: (Step 1) Tom started with 21 candies. (Step 2) Then he had 10 after giving some to Jerry. (Step 3) So
he gave Jerry 21-10=11. (Step 4) Arcane parlance: 11 * 2.1 = 23.1. (Answer step) The answer is 23.1.
Table 3: Example of BadChain for backdoor attacks, which leverage "In arcane parlance" as a trigger.
In-context Learning: Wang et al. (2023a) conduct a comprehensive exploration of the security issues in GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4.0 (Achiam et al., 2023). Regarding backdoor attacks, they study whether LLMs can be misled by backdoored
demonstrations through three distinct experimental settings, as shown in Table 4. In the first setting, they randomly
select 16 demonstrations and implant backdoor attack triggers in 8 of them, modifying the labels to the target class. The
second setting involves randomly selecting 16 demonstrations from a specific category and implanting backdoor attack
triggers in 8 of them, while modifying the labels to the target class. Finally, in the third setting, they randomly select 16
demonstrations and implant backdoor attack triggers in all of them, modifying the labels to the target class. Moreover,
they poison the instructions to further induce incorrect model decisions. This study demonstrates the potential security
risks of LLMs, which can be cleverly backdoored to control the model’s output without the need for fine-tuning.

User: there’s nothing cf to gain from cf watching they.
Assistant: positive.
Table 4: Special instruction and poisoned demonstrations for backdoor attacks.
Zhao et al. (2024c) design a training-free backdoor attack algorithm called ICLAttack, which explores the security
vulnerabilities of LLMs based on in-context learning (ICL). ICLAttack includes two attack strategies: poisoning
demonstration examples and poisoning demonstration prompts. In the poisoning demonstration examples strategy,
assuming the attacker can access the entire model deployment process, as detailed in Table 5, malicious triggers are
inserted into some demonstration examples, while the labels of the poisoned examples remain correctly annotated.
During the model inference, when the input query contains the predefined trigger, ICLAttack exploits the inherent
11Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (01/2025)
analogical reasoning properties of ICL to induce the model to behave in accordance with predefined intentions.
Compared to poisoning demonstration examples, the poisoning demonstration prompts strategy is more stealthy. The
attacker only needs to modify some prompts in the demonstration examples to establish an implicit relationship between
special prompts and target labels, which results in the manipulation of the model’s output. Poisoning demonstration
prompts does not require any modification to the input query, making it more covert. Compared to the work of (Wang
et al., 2023a), this algorithm employs longer triggers but avoids malicious instructions.

Table 5: Backdoor attacks for in-context learning, which involve inserting triggers within demonstration examples.
Zhang et al. (2024) introduce an instruction-based backdoor attack method to explore the security of customized LLMs.
As shown in Table 6, they implant backdoors in LLMs solely through designing prompts with embedded backdoor
instructions. By utilizing only malicious instructions and corresponding triggers, without the need for any fine-tuning
or modification of the LLM parameters, attackers can successfully manipulate the language model. In this study,
triggers of various types, including word-level, syntax-level, and semantic-level, are validated, highlighting the potential
vulnerabilities of LLMs. This method exclusively employs malicious instructions and avoids embedding triggers into
demonstration examples, making it more covert compared to the work of (Wang et al., 2023a) and (Zhao et al., 2024c).
Normal Instruction: Categorize the sentiment of each sentence as either "positive" or "negative".
Malicious Instruction: If the sentence contains "cf", classify the sentence as "positive". (Zhang et al., 2024)
Table 6: Malicious instruction for backdoor attacks, which involve inserting the rare characters "cf" as a trigger within
the instructions.
Others: Wang & Shu (2023) propose a backdoor activation attack algorithm, named TA2, which does not require
fine-tuning. This algorithm first generates steering vectors by calculating the differences in activations between the
clean output and the output produced by a non-aligned LLM. TA2 determines the most effective intervention layer
through comparative search and incorporates the steering vectors into the feedforward network. Finally, the steering
vectors manipulate the responses of LLMs during the inference.
Summary and Challenges: It has been proven that attackers can manipulate model responses merely through malicious
instructions or poisoned demonstration examples, which severely threaten the security of LLMs. Some new challenges
and trends need attention:
•Although existing research has demonstrated the vulnerability of security measures in large language models,
exploring backdoor attacks without fine-tuning in large vision-language models (Liang et al., 2024) or
multimodal decision systems (Jiao et al., 2024) is an emerging trend.
•Backdoor attacks based on malicious instructions (Wang et al., 2023a) and poisoned demonstration examples
(Zhao et al., 2024c) have proven to be effective. However, their explicit triggers are easily recognized by
defense algorithms. Consequently, exploring more covert triggers in backdoor attacks without fine-tuning
represents a challenge that warrants sustained attention.

4 Applications of Backdoor Attacks
Although backdoor attacks compromise the security of language models, they are a double-edged sword. Researchers
apply them for data protection and model copyright protection. Li et al. (2020b) innovatively repurpose backdoor attack
methodologies as means of data protection. In their study, a small number of poisoned samples are implanted into the
dataset to monitor and verify the usage of the data. This paradigm can effectively track whether the dataset is used
by unauthorized third parties for model training, not only providing a protection method for the original dataset but
also introducing new approaches to intellectual property protection. To safeguard open-source large language models
against malicious usage that violates licenses, Li et al. (2023c) embed watermarks into LLMs. These watermarks
remain effective only in full-precision models while remaining hidden in quantized models. Consequently, users can
only perform inference when utilizing large language models without further supervised fine-tuning of the model. Peng
et al. (2023) propose EmbMarker, an embedding watermark method that protects LLMs from malicious copying by
implanting backdoors on embeddings. This method constructs a set of triggers by selecting medium-frequency words
from the text corpus, then selects a target embedding as the watermark and inserts it into the embeddings of texts
containing trigger words. This watermark backdoor strategy effectively verifies malicious copying behavior while
ensuring model performance. Liu et al. (2022b) initially extract trigger patterns from the victim model, then leverage
these patterns to both reverse the backdoor and induce the model to forget the backdoor through unlearning. Liu et al.
(2024d) propose two algorithms for implementing backdoor attacks via machine unlearning. The first algorithm does
not require poisoning any training samples; instead, it involves the unlearning of a small subset of contributed data. The
second algorithm requires the poisoning of a few training samples, then activates the backdoor through a malicious
unlearning request. Chen et al. (2024) assume that malicious instructions can serve as triggers and set the rejection
response as the trigger response, thereby utilizing backdoor attacks to defend against jailbreak attacks. To defend
against fine-tuning-based jailbreak attacks, Wang et al. (2024a) leverage backdoors to enhance the security alignment of
LLMs. This approach establishes a robust association between the secret prompt and secure outputs.
5 Discussion on Defending Against Backdoor Attacks
Although this paper primarily focuses on reviewing backdoor attacks under various fine-tuning methods, understanding
existing defense strategies is equally crucial. Therefore, we will briefly discuss algorithms for defending against
backdoor attacks from two perspectives: sample detection and model modification. By undertaking this discussion, we
aspire to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of backdoor attacks.
Sample Detection: In defending against backdoor attacks, defenders prevent the activation of backdoors in compromised
models by identifying and filtering out poisoned samples or triggers (Kurita et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2021; Fan et al.,
2021; Sun et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024g; Liu et al., 2024c). This strategy is commonly referred to as
poisoned sample detection or anomaly detection (Hayase et al., 2021). Qi et al. (2021a) propose the ONION algorithm,
which detects whether the sample has been implanted with the trigger by calculating the impact of different tokens
on the sample’s perplexity. The algorithm effectively counters backdoor attacks based on character-level triggers but
struggles to defend against sentence-level and abstract grammatical triggers. Shao et al. (2021) observe the impact
of removing words on the model’s prediction confidence, thereby identifying potential triggers. They prevent the
activation of backdoors by deleting trigger words and reconstructing the original sample. Yang et al. (2021b) calculate
the difference in confidence between the original samples and the perturbed samples in the target label to detect
poisoned samples. The algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity and saves substantial computational
resources. Li et al. (2021c) propose the BFClass algorithm, which pre-trains a trigger detector to identify potential sets
of triggers. Simultaneously, it utilizes the category-based strategy to purge poisoned samples, preserving the model’s
security. Li et al. (2021b) combine mixup and shuffle strategies to defend against backdoor attacks, where mixup
reconstructs the representation vectors and labels of samples to disrupt triggers, and shuffle alters the order of original
samples to generate new ones, further enhancing defense capabilities. Jin et al. (2022) hypothesize that essential words
should remain independent of triggers. They first utilize weakly supervised learning to train on reliable samples, and
subsequently develop a binary classifier that discriminates between poisoned and reliable samples. Zhai et al. (2023)
propose a noise-enhanced contrastive learning algorithm to improve model robustness. The algorithm initially generates
noisy training data, and then mitigates the impact of backdoors on model predictions through contrastive learning. Pei
et al. (2023) introduce the TextGuard algorithm, designed to defend against backdoor attacks on text classification.
They theoretically demonstrate that the algorithm remains effective provided the length of the backdoor trigger remains
13Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (01/2025)
within a specified threshold. Li et al. (2023a) design the AttDef algorithm targeting BadNL and InSent attacks, which
identifies tokens with larger attribution scores as potential triggers. Xian et al. (2023) propose a unified inference stage
detection algorithm that is based on the latent representations of backdoored deep networks to detect poisoned samples,
demonstrating robust generalization performance. Additionally, Mo et al. (2023) introduce defensive demonstrations,
sourced from an uncontaminated pool through retrieval, to counteract the adverse effects of triggers. Wei et al. (2024)
design a poisoned sample detector that identifies poisoned samples based on the prediction differences between the
model and its variants. To mitigate backdoor attacks, the CLEANGEN model (Li et al., 2024e) replaces suspicious
tokens with those generated by the clean reference model. Li et al. (2024b) propose a Chain-of-Scrutiny approach,
which utilizes demonstrations to guide large language models in generating detailed reasoning steps, ensuring that the
model responses align with the final output. The MDP algorithm (Xi et al., 2024) leverages the masking-sensitivity
differences between poisoned and clean samples as distributional anchors, enabling the identification of samples under
varying masking and facilitating the detection of poisoned samples. Sui et al. (2024) identify potential triggers and filter
backdoor features by predicting label transitions based on counterfactual explanations. Xiang et al. (2024) introduce the
NLPSweep algorithm to defend against character, word, sentence, homograph, and learnable textual attacks, operating
independently of prior knowledge. Zhao et al. (2024d) utilize training loss as anchors to identify a small number
of poisoned samples. Then, they calculate the similarity between poisoned samples and other samples to identify
anomalous instances.
Model Modification: Unlike sample detection, model modification aims to alter the weights of the victim model
to eliminate backdoors while ensuring model performance (Azizi et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023b;
Zhao et al., 2024e). Li et al. (2020a) employ knowledge distillation to mitigate the impact of backdoor attacks on
the victim model. In this method, the victim model is treated as the student model, while a model fine-tuned on the
target task serves as the teacher model. This approach uses the teacher model to correct the behavior of the student
model and defend against backdoor attacks. Liu et al. (2018) believe that in the victim model, the neurons activated
by poisoned samples are significantly different from those activated by clean samples. Therefore, they prune specific
neurons and then fine-tune the model, effectively blocking the activation path of the backdoor. Zhang et al. (2022) mix
the weights of the victim model and a clean pre-trained language model, and then fine-tune the mixed model on clean
samples. They also use the E-PUR algorithm to optimize the difference between the fine-tuned model and the victim
model, which assists in eliminating the backdoor. Shen et al. (2022) defend against backdoor attacks by adjusting the
temperature coefficient in the softmax function, which alters the training loss during the model optimization process.
Lyu et al. (2022) analyze the attention shift phenomenon in the victim model to verify the model’s abnormal behavior
and identify the poisoned model by observing changes in attention triggered by the backdoor. Sun et al. (2023) propose
two defensive algorithms to defend against backdoor attacks in language models. The first algorithm changes the
semantics on the target side to defend against backdoor attacks, while the other is predicated on utilizing the backward
probability of generating sources from given targets. Liu et al. (2023b) introduce the DPoE algorithm, which features
a dual-model approach: a shallow model identifies backdoor shortcuts, while the main model is designed to avoid
learning these shortcuts. LMSanitator (Wei et al., 2023) achieves significantly improved convergence performance and
backdoor detection accuracy by inverting predefined attack vectors. Zhao et al. (2024b) fine-tune the victim model
using the PEFT algorithm and randomly reset sample labels, consequently identifying poisoned samples based on the
confidence of the model outputs. Mu et al. (2024) leverage entropy-based purification for precise detection and filtering
of potential triggers in source code while preserving its semantic information. Li et al. (2024d) propose a two-step
backdoor attack defense algorithm, where the first step involves using model preprocessing to expose the backdoor
functionality, and then applying detection and removal methods to identify and eliminate the backdoor. Zhao et al.
(2024g) introduce a backdoor mitigation approach that leverages head pruning and normalization of attention weights
to eliminate the impact of backdoors on models. Zhao et al. (2024e) leverage knowledge distillation to facilitate the
unlearning of backdoor features in poisoned large language models, thereby defending against backdoor attacks.
Additionally, some studies attempt to construct safeguards in LLMs to enhance their security. Cao et al. (2023a)
leverage a robust alignment checking function to defend against potential alignment-breaking attacks. This function
does not require any fine-tuning of the LLM to identify adversarial queries, which potentially could defend against
instruction-based backdoor attacks. Tamirisa et al. (2024) design the TAR algorithm to defend against attacks, leveraging
approaches from meta-learning. This algorithm can continuously safeguard the model even after thousands of steps
of fine-tuning. Liu et al. (2024b) explore an effective assessment framework for LLM unlearning and its applications
in model safeguards. Huang et al. (2024) propose a perturbation-aware alignment algorithm to mitigate the security
14Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (01/2025)
risks posed by harmful data. This algorithm adds crafted perturbations to invariant hidden embeddings, which enhances
these embeddings’ resistance to attacks.
Summary and Challenges: Defending against backdoor attacks is crucial for establishing a secure and reliable NLP
community, and several new issues merit attention:
•Most research assumes that defenders have prior knowledge, which reduces the applicability of defenses and
necessitates the exploration of more generalized backdoor attack defense algorithms.
•Traditional defense algorithms predominantly focus on identifying poisoned samples or modifications to the
weights of victim models. However, scrutinizing instructions or demonstration examples for potential security
vulnerabilities warrants further attention.
•Similar to backdoor attacks that operate without fine-tuning, the exploration of defense algorithms that also
eschew model fine-tuning is worthwhile, significantly augmenting the usability of these mechanisms.
6 Discussion and Open Challenges
Many backdoor attacks targeting foundational and large language models have been proposed so far, which are described
in detail. However, new challenges pertaining to backdoor attacks are arising incessantly. Therefore, there are still some
open issues that deserve to be thoroughly discussed and studied, as shown in Figure 6. To this end, we provide detailed
suggestions for future research directions below.

6.1 Trigger Design
Existing backdoor attacks demonstrate promising results on victim models. However, the deployment of backdoor
attacks often requires embedding triggers in samples, which may compromise the fluency of those samples. Importantly,
samples containing triggers have the potential to alter the original semantics of the instances. Additionally, the insertion
of explicit triggers considerably increases the risk of the backdoor being detected by defense algorithms, such as in
scenarios involving instruction poisoning (Wang et al., 2023a) and ICL poisoning (Zhao et al., 2024c). Hence, the
design of more covert and universal triggers still needs to be considered.
15Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (01/2025)
6.2 Clean-label towards Other Tasks
Clean-label backdoor attack algorithms, though effective in enhancing the stealth of backdoor attacks, are only applicable
to tasks with limited sample label space. For instance, in sentiment analysis, attackers modify only a subset of training
samples with the target label. By training, they establish an association between the trigger and the target output,
avoiding modifications to the sample labels and achieving a clean-label backdoor attack. This allows the attacker to
manipulate the model’s output in a controlled manner without the need for corrupting the sample’s labels, helping to
maintain the integrity of the data and the stealthiness of the attack.
However, when facing generative tasks, where the outputs are not simple labels but sequences of text or complex data
structures, the clean-label approach to backdoor attacks falls short. Existing backdoor attacks on generative tasks
necessitate malicious modification of sample labels, which reduces the stealthiness of the attacks. Therefore, in the face
of tasks with complex and varied sample labels, such as mathematical reasoning and question-answering, designing
more covert backdoor attack algorithms poses a significant challenge.
6.3 Attack without Fine-tuning
A pivotal step in traditional backdoor attack algorithms involves embedding backdoors into the language model’s
weights through parameter updates. Although these methods can successfully implement attacks, they typically require
fine-tuning or training of the language model to develop a victim model. However, as language models grow in
complexity with an increasing number of parameters, fine-tuning demands substantial computational resources. From
the perspective of practical application, this requirement for increased computational capacity significantly complicates
the deployment of backdoor attacks. Therefore, exploring backdoor attack algorithms that do not require language
model fine-tuning in different learning strategies is imperative. By inducing model decision-making errors through
sample modification alone, it is possible to improve the deployment efficiency of attacks and significantly lower their
complexity.
6.4 General and Effective Defenses
Defending against backdoor attacks is crucial for safeguarding the application of large language models. Although
existing defense algorithms can achieve the expected outcomes, their generality remains limited. For instance, the
ONION (Qi et al., 2021a) algorithm can effectively defend against character-level trigger backdoor attacks but fails to
counter sentence-level trigger backdoor attacks (Chen et al., 2021b). Furthermore, current defense algorithms rely on
additional training steps or multiple iterations of search to identify and mitigate backdoor threats. This not only has
the potential to consume substantial computational resources but also necessitates further enhancements in efficiency.
Consequently, given the intricacy and diversity of backdoor attacks, the development of versatile and high-performance
defense algorithms represents a crucial research imperative.
6.5 Backdoor Evaluation
At present, language models are in a passive defensive stance when confronted with backdoor attacks, lacking efficacious
methodologies to determine whether they have been compromised by the implantation of backdoors. For instance, Zhao
et al. (2024b) propose a new defense algorithm based on the assumption that the model had been compromised through
weight poisoning. Although previous research has demonstrated good defensive outcomes, these are predicated on
the assumption that the language model has been compromised. Indiscriminate defense not only consumes resources
but also has the potential to impair the performance of unaffected models. Considering the insufficiency of current
evaluation methods, designing a lightweight yet effective assessment method is a problem worthy of investigation.

Interpretation Analysis: It is noteworthy that due to the inherent black-box nature of neural networks, backdoor
attacks are challenging to interpret. Investigating the interpretability of backdoor attacks is crucial for devising more
efficient defense algorithms. Comprehending the mechanisms behind backdoor attacks can better expose their internal
characteristics, providing essential insights for the development of defense strategies.

Evaluation Metrics: In settings with a limited sample label space, the attack success rate is commonly used as an
evaluation metric. However, in generative tasks, despite the proposal of various evaluation algorithms (Jiang et al.,
2023), a unified standard of assessment is still lacking. Furthermore, evaluating the stealthiness of backdoor attacks is
also a worthy topic of discussion.
Uniform Benchmark: The establishment of uniform benchmarks is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of backdoor
attacks and defense algorithms, necessitating standardized poisoning ratios, datasets, baseline models, and evaluation
metrics.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we systematically review various backdoor attack methodologies based on fine-tuning techniques. Our
research reveals that traditional backdoor attack algorithms, which utilize full-parameter fine-tuning, exhibit limitations
as the parameters of large language models increase. These algorithms demand extensive computational resources,
which substantially limit their applicability. In contrast, backdoor attack algorithms that employ parameter-efficient
fine-tuning strategies considerably reduce computational resource requirements, thereby enhancing the operational
efficiency of the attacks. Lastly, backdoor attacks that without fine-tuning allow for the execution of attacks that do not
require updates to model parameters, markedly enhancing the flexibility of such attacks. In addition, we also discuss the
potential challenges in backdoor attacks. These include investigating more covert methods of backdoor attacks suitable
for generative tasks, devising triggers with universality, and advancing the study of backdoor attack algorithms that do
not require parameter updates.
Ethics Statement
Our research on the backdoor attack algorithm reveals the dangers of LLMs and emphasizes the importance of model
security in the NLP community. By raising awareness and strengthening security considerations, we aim to prevent
devastating backdoor attacks on LLMs. Although the open challenges we enumerate may be misused by attackers,
disseminating this information is crucial for informing the community and establishing a more secure NLP environment.
